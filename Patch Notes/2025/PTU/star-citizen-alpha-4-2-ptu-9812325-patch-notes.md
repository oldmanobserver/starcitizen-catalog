# Testing/Feedback Focus
**Wikelo Custom Components Going into 4.2 LIVE**
The issue with missing upgraded components on Wikelo ships has been resolved in the 4.2 update. (Executive Hangar ships are being worked on to also be fixed but not in the build just yet) 
Starting with this update, all newly purchased ships from Wikelo will automatically include the upgraded components.
For players who bought Wikelo ships before 4.2 and still have the base components, there are two ways to receive the upgrade: Store the ship before 4.2 goes LIVE  or file an insurance claim on the ship after the LIVE release. In either case, the ship will return with the upgraded components instead of base.
