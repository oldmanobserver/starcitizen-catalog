# Known Issues
Going into the LIVE release of 4.1.1, we are expecting equipped items  and armor to disappear off the player. This issue is fixed in builds  after 4.1.1 is LIVE but going into this build it will occur.
We are expecting the new 3d comms calls to work but there's a chance they won't always appear on some sessions. Relaunching the game may help resolve this but we are looking for further updates Friday to help.
