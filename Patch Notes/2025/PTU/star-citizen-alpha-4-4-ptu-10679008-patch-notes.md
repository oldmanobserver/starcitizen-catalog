Intention with this update is to make injuries reflective of time spent in combat and act as 'warnings' when you need to rest and restore.
- The amount of damage to get an injury has increased for each body part (around 1.5x)
- Reduces how much Max HP reduction you get from initial injuries 
- Removed RNG chance for injuries to occur, injuries now have binary trigger thresholds 

**Vanduul-Tech Smugglers / Asteroid Bases**
General art, LOD, and performance optimizations for mission asteroid bases. Mission logic polish to help with key code issues. Limited number of voices that are playing at the same time for hub central fire FX. Created a positional variant of the main hub area alarm. Added the lockdown sound to ambush music event. Added lockdown lifted FX to deactivate lights music event. Updated damaging steam VFX to appear more deadly. Mission is now behind a reputation gate that will require a bit of time to achieve before available.
