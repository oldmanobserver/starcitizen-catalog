# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.3
Alpha Patch 4.3 has been released to all backers!   Patch should now show: VERSION 4.3.0-PTU.10029568.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, unstowed vehicles, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: All Backers
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing and subject to removal.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

# Known Issues
> We are currently tracking an issue blocking more waves into PTU that is causing players not to be able to respawn. There may be a workaround for this to wait incapacitated until you get AFK timed out and it forces you to the main menu 
> Spacebreak and Boost in ships is causing an increase in Client Crashes in this build. You may want to avoid these if you are getting too many crashes while doing it.

# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Onyx Facilities**
Onyx Facilities house a new investigation mission system set in approximately 100 newly added, abandoned research locations spread throughout Stanton. While ASD has abandoned these facilities, players and mercenary NPCs alike will be exploring these derelict Associated Sciences and Development (ASD) installations to recover data, solve puzzles, and uncover the mysteries within these hazardous environments. With the release of Alpha 4.3, the first 2 wings will be available, with the third and concluding chapter to this part of the Regen Crisis arriving the following month in Alpha 4.3.1.
- **Initial Facility Access**
Arken Mallor, a new mission giver from Hockrow Agency, tasks you with venturing into these abandoned ASD Onyx Facilities, recovering whatever research data still exists, and uncovering the true extent of ASD's experiments into the Regen Crisis.
- **Delving Into the Deep Facility**
Upon completion of the Phase 1 missions, four new mission tracks within the facility become available through the two open wings of the Onyx Facilities. These must be first completed in succession before becoming repeatable in any order.
- Retrieve Energy Anomaly Data
- Retrieve Security Data
- Retrieve Seismic Data
- Retrieve Power Usage Data

These new mission tracks will take you through two open wings of the Onyx Facilities
- **Research Labs**
Discover multiple data collection points containing valuable research data and audio logs that reveal the mysterious circumstances behind the facility's abandonment. 
- **Engineering**
Navigate hazardous power systems and radiation zones while demonstrating careful environmental awareness and planning.


**Mission Distribution Tech Updates**
Mission Distribution Tech Updates in 4.3 include an updated way of directing players around locations for missions that are unlimited, such as Hauling, Wikelo, and the new Onyx location missions. This system should greatly improve location spreading when many players are attempting the same missions.

> **Weapons and Items**
**VOLT Laser Sniper "Zenith"**
Introducing a powerful new weapon that combines the raw punch of a charged sniper shot with the rapid-fire precision of a marksman rifle. 

The Zenith rifle's ability to automatically charge when held gives you more flexibility in the battlefield at the cost of being audible to possible hostiles. The Zenith comes with the first optic with a built in charge and a heat tracker, as managing heat is crucial and overheating renders the weapon temporarily inoperable. 

Players can test out the Zenith rifle in single weapon elimination so feedback can be easily provided.
- Damage: 42.5
- Projectile velocity: 700
- Aim down sight time: 0.32
- Recoil: Low
- Optic: 4X - 8X (has charge and heat tracker)
- RPM: 492
- Mag size: 22
Charge multiplier
- Ammo cost 3x
- projectile speed multiplier 2x
- damage multiplier 2x
**VOLT Shotgun**
- Fixed an issue causing the VOLT shotgun to cause knockdowns unintentionally
**Additional Weapon & Item Updates**
- Ammo type availability in stores has been greatly increased and balanced around all weapon shops
> **Core Tech**
**Dynamic Snow**
Introducing dynamic snow to select locations where snow already exists, leveraging the same environmental systems that power dynamic rain. This means snowfall will now appear based on weather conditions. Currently snow is enabled on Stanton 4.

**Ladder Improvements**
Implementation of further ladder systems into Star Citizen. This update includes many new traversal mechanics to all ladders in ships and environments around the persistent universe.
This includes:
-     Look around while on ladder (180 degree whilst moving, 355 degree whilst stationary)
-     Mid point enter/exits
-     Being able to Jump off ladders while looking in a direction
-     Leaning (used to dodge debris) function
-     Collision (e.g. other Actor on ladder) prevents traversal up ladder
-     FPS Camera required enter angle
-     Ladder exit into crouch/small spaces
