Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.

Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
Server Recovery: Enabled

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
