# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.1
Alpha Patch 4.1 has been released to the PTU, and is now available to test!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.1.0-PTU.9620182.


# Build Info
Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.

- Audience: Wave 3
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled
- Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
- Server Recovery: Enabled
- Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.



# Testing/Feedback Focus
This initial release of 4.1 comes with some pretty dramatic changes to items and recovery. This is a first iteration of item recovery with much more to come in future builds.
- Stability & Bugfixes
- Enabling Orison and Area 18 NPE
- T0 Item Recovery
- Ground Vehicle & FPS Mining Updates
- Wikelo Collector Missions (Intro Mission Should now function and allow for subsequent Collector Missions to be completed)
- New Upcoming Event Mission (Keeping all details limited to test in game communication)
Tonight's build has further Hathor Location Art/Animation/Audio Polish as well as Balance Changes and a full replacement of enemies at the Hathor ground location. We have worked on numerous flow blocking issues for the Hathor locations, Events, and Collector Missions as well as temporarily reduced the Collector mission requirements to about 10% of what will be normally needed.
This event will utilize 2 new locations in the PU; Hathor Platform Alignment Facilities and Hathor Orbital Laser Platform.
