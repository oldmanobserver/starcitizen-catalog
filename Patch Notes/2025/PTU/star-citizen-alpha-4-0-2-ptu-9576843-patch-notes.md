# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0.2
Alpha Patch 4.0.2 has been released onto the PTU environment!  Launcher should now show: VERSION 4.0.2-PTU.9576843.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

# Testing/Feedback Focus
**4.0.2 Release Goals**
The 4.0.2 release is highly focused on 3 key points to improve and fix as many top key gameplay issues as possible, improve connectivity/stability, and begin the latest Supply or Die Pyro Event.
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Supply or Die Event
Tonight's build has further updates to transit self-healing and code cleanup as well as more focused logging to narrow down some final issues encountered.
Further work has gone into the build to help with long load times as well. We suspect there is more to go but are working to reduce these.


# Known Issues
- Blocker: PU - Transit/Elevators - Elevators are present but panel buttons stop functioning (See above. Lots of work has been done on the code and cleanup side but we are leaving this open until we are happy with the state transit is in)
- Critical: PU - Transit - Entity carriage is stuck in transit to a gateway, but never arrives which renders the gateway unusable
- Critical: PU - ASOP / Ship / Cargo - Upon the Ship auto storing through leaving game or leaving hangar; on initial retrieval the Cargo disappears and Cargo Grid is locked from being used
- Critical: PU - Missions / UI - NPE - The Mission markers are missing from the Tutorial Missions and blocking progression
- Critical: Mission Refactor - Comm Array Repair - Contract in mobiGlas becomes hidden when another player enters mission location
- Critical: Mission Refactor - PVP Missions dont work
- Critical: PU - Star Map - Party Members do not appear on the star map or area map
- High: PU - Pyro - Jump Points - Locations / Spacescaping - Asteroids  that surround the Stanton Gateway can be seen inside the Jump Tunnel and  occasionally can cause fatal collisions when exiting the Jump Tunnel
- High: PU - Pyro - Jump Point - Failing a Jump point will displace the player far away from the gateway station
