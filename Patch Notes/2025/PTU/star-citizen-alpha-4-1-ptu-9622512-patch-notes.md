# Features & Gameplay
- **Locations**
- Wikelo Collector Location, Audio, and Animation Polish Pass
- **Gameplay**
- Further Align and Mine Audio, Art, Animation, and VFX Polish
- Balanced number of mineable rocks spawned in planetary surface to compensate for fewer gems per rock
- **Ships and Vehicles**
**Collision Physics Update**
Ship Collision damage handling is now done using full collision data passed down by physics. This means mass and speed is now fully calculated in the collision and will make collision damage between all ships, big and small, behave more realistically.

-Greatly reduced Fuel storage for Pisces, Cutter, and SRV to be more in line with smaller ships.
-Reduced 1st and 3rd person camera shake in ships
-Further Hornet and Starlancer MAX Flight Mass Changes
- **Weapons and Items**
**NEW WEAPON - VOLT RIFLE - Paralax**
Verified Offworld Laser Technologies are here with their brand new powerful assault rifle which introduces the overheat mechanic and evolves as it fires
The Parallax Rifle has been added, you can trade in some valuable supplies to the collector to try out this rifle.

The rifle builds up heat increasing it's fire rate (up to 35%) and once enough heat is built up, turns into a powerful beam. The temperature of the atmosphere you are in effects how quickly or slowly this heat builds up. For example; If you are on a cold planet, the weapon will take much longer to turn into a beam and vice versa for a hot planet. The weapon however can overheat and be unable to fire if ran too hot which in future updates will cause significant wear. Currently, this weapon is also in Single Weapon Elimination in AC
Magazines will be added to the shops.
- Fire rate - 600
- Damage - 15

**Grenade Launcher Balance**
The intention with these changes is to make the Grenade Launcher have more focus on skill expression as opposed to raw power.
- Grenade Launcher Max Damage Radius Decreased from 6M to 5M
- Grenade Launcher Min Damage Radius Decreased from 2M to 0M
- Max physics radius decreased from 8M to 5M and pressure reduced (shouldn't cause knockdowns)
- Damage decreased from 16.5 to 12.5 (this hits multiple body parts due to being an explosion, this makes it so you need to land 3 shots instead of 2)
- Increased min and max spread significantly
- Aim down sight time increased from 0.17 to 0.25
These changes keep the grenade launcher as a powerful weapon but require players to be more 'prepped' by forcing them to aim to get consistent results
Overall this will bring the power level of the grenade launcher down whilst still keeping it's indentity and making it a more higher skill weapon

**Ripper SMG**
-Recoil Pass
-DPS increased from 135 to 165
-fixed being unable to fire when under a certain ammo capacity
-slightly increased ammo consumption rate

**Custodian**
- Damage increased from 11.1 to 12

**P8AR**
- Increased Min spread from 1 to 4.5
- This removes the 'free' shot you got in hipfire which was a strong component of the weapon
- Increased aim down sight time from 0.25 to 0.3
- increased delay before recoil return time from 0.35 to 0.43

- **Arena Commander**
- Single Weapon Elimination is now active in AC with other FPS mode temporarily disabled to focus testing on SWE now featuring the VOLT RIFLE - Paralax
