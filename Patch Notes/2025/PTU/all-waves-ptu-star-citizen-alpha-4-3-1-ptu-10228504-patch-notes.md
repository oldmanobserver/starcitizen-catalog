# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Onyx Facilities**

Onyx Facility Polish and Further Mission Inclusions for Science Wing that delves further into the story.
> **Ships and Vehicles**
**Armor and Ballistic Damage changes**
In order to enhance the overall ship ballistic weapons in game the team delivered these changes for the upcoming 4.3.1 patch

Base armor ballistic reduction damage has now been set to 40% across all ships (previously 50%) with some few exception that the team think required a specific unique tuning.
This means that ballistic guns will be more effective across the board against all targets.
Shield ballistic absorption reduction damage has now been set to 20% for all shields (previously 30%).
This means that ballistic guns will be more effective across the board against all targets even when they have their shields up and running.
Some Ground vehicles were missing the proper ballistic armor damage modifiers.
This should be fixed now and every vehicle in game should respect the above new standards mentioned.

**Gladius Flight changes**
After an initial metrics and feedback analysis post 4.3.0 the team decided to adjust Gladius performances further
- Gladius Forward accelerations are now increased (from 13 Gs to 13.6 Gs)
- Gladius angular accelerations are now improved and should provide enhanced reactiveness to flight controls.

**Missiles damage radius adjustments**
The team adjusted and increased the missile explosion radiuses to help with the overall missile effectiveness.
These changes involve all missile from S1 to S7.
Missile Size | Min. Explosion Range (meters) | Max. Explosion Range (meters)
- S01 - 1 - 2m
- S02 - 1.5 - 2.5m
- S03 - 2.5 - 3.5m
- S04 - 2.5 - 5m
- S05 - 3.5 - 5m
- S07 - 4.5 - 7m
Additionally, the proximity explosion fuse has been set to 0.5m for Missile and Torpedoes of all sizes.

> **Weapons and Items**
**VOLT LMG "Fresnel"**
The engineers at VOLT crafted the Fresnel LMG to bring a powerful energy weapon to the frontlines. Initiate the fight with a rapid spray of deadly blasts, but as the weapon heats up, the shots become slower and more powerful - naturally providing a controlled finish to the combat encounter. But a weapon of this magnitude demands a strong foundation; operators are encouraged to fire from a crouching position to allow for better recoil management.

The VOLT Lmg is the first LMG that has been released in a while and has been given some extra love in terms of future proofing the design intent of LMGs.
- Is able to use S3 optics
- Crouch and prone each have their own recoil reduction modifiers making braced operators have far less recoil 
- Features it's own 'super heavy' sway profile which means the weapon has a delay to resetting it's sight on targets upon horizontal / vertical aiming movement (TBD if this doesn't occur when crouched / Prone)
VOLT LMG Stats:
- Volt LMG mags and weapon are very heavy (150% heavier then FS9)
- Damage: 6.85 -> 54.8
- Projectile Velocity: 110
- Aim down Sight Time: 0.43
- RPM: 550 -> 82.5
- Mag size:  165
- Recoil: Stance Sensitive 

**Other FPS updates**
- Added FPS Weapons Shop to Lorville Security Tower
- Updated medium (Rifles) aiming sway feel to make weapons feel heavier (let us know what you think before we do a pass on light / heavy type weapons)
- Reduced parallax on NVTAC branded scopes making them bounce less when firing  

# Bug Fixes
- Potential Fix: PU - Freight Elevator - Server Error while a player is using a Freight Elevator kiosk causes that kiosk to kick the player out, preventing them using it, until it is streamed out and back in
- Potential Fix: Idris series - PU - Tier 3 medical beds are missing from medical room
- Potential Fix: Vehicle- Multivariant / Mirai Guardian Series - Bedlog - Getting out of Guardian beds from bedlog causes actor to animate to the wrong side of the bed and clip out of the ship
- Potential Fix: Idris Series - PU - Idris Tier 1 medical bed has refill station for medical goop behind the medical bed not correctly positioned (STARC-178944)

# Technical
- Fixed 1 Client Crash
