# Testing/Feedback Focus
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Save Stanton Chapter 2 Event in Pyro
Chapter 2 of Save Stanton will run throughout the PTU phases in 4.0.1. This is a continuation of the event from 3.24.3 into the Pyro side of events.

**Updates to Save Stanton Ch 2**
- Possible Fix: PU - Pyro - Save Stanton - Phase 6/7 - Missions / UI - Mission Objective marker displays on a previous mission location when performing consecutive run throughs
- Possible Fix: PU - Pyro - mobiGlas / Mission Content / Save Stanton - Priority Mission tab missing when exited with an active Priority Mission
- Possible Fix: PU - Pyro - WTP - Phase 6 - Missions / AI - WipeOutLocations contract spawns additional targets after eliminating the initial targets resulting in the required number of targets to increase
Save Stanton Chapter 2 missions are designed to be reputation locked to the faction you are working towards and due to this, the missions for the event will not be sharable to avoid cross-reputation issues
