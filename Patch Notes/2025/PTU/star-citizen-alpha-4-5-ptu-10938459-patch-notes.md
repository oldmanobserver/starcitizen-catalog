Made further updates to shield energy weapon resistances so shields will take slightly more damage from energy weapons. Resistances updates for all ship components to increase lifetime of components. New impact effect for item / component repairing. Removed empty salvage canisters from loot. MISC Freelancer MIS Shield Health: 3720 → 3900. MISC Starlancer TAC Shield Health: 22800 → 24000
