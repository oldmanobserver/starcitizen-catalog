# Features & Gameplay

> **Gameplay**
**Equipment Swapping Hierarchy**
Equipment swapping now has some hierarchy when swapping out gear using the new UI. This iteration will transfer items equipped to the outside of the armor to the newly swapped out one but not items stored inside. This will also only work using the latest looting UI and not the old interface so using kiosks currently behave like before.

When the player is attempting to swap equipment, e.g. looting an enemies armor, then: Every item attached to the old armor or undersuit such as weapons, grenades, medpens, and backpacks should attempt to transfer to the relevant slots on the new armor or undersuit. If there is not enough space on the new armor for the items, then they should be placed within the backpack inventory. If there is not enough space within the backpack, then they will be dropped on the floor.


**Storm Breaker and ASD Location Polish**
Added Lighting changes for cool down phase in the data center credential printer. FPS AI Numbers adjustments around Storm Breaker locations to slightly reduce their numbers in key areas. ASD Buildings Art and LOD Pass.

**Apex Valakkar Polish**
Increased Damage and Radius of Valakkar Explosion. Further Valakkar Performance Optimizations
