# Testing/Feedback Focus
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Save Stanton Chapter 2 Event in Pyro

**Updates to Save Stanton Ch 2**
Chapter 2 of Save Stanton will run throughout the PTU phases in 4.0.1. This is a continuation of the event from 3.24.3 into the Pyro side of events.
- Fixed - PU - Pyro - Phase 6 - Missions / mobiGlas - WipeOutLocations mission objective incorrectly states to clear the exterior of AI when the AI within the interior of the base also need to be eliminated
- Fixed - PU - Pyro - Phase 6 - Missions / AI - Ship AI float above the planet surface and do not engage the player
- Fixed - PU - Pyro - Phase 6 - Missions - DestroySupplyLines contract does not complete after eliminating all targets

Save Stanton Chapter 2 missions are designed to be reputation locked to the faction you are working towards and due to this, the missions for the event will not be sharable to avoid cross-reputation issues
