# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.3.0
Alpha Patch 4.3 has been released to all backers! Patch should now show: VERSION 4.3.0-PTU 10063469

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, unstowed vehicles, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: All Backers
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Territory Configuration: 7:3:600
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing and subject to removal.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
