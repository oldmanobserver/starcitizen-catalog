# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.1
Alpha Patch 4.1 has been released to Evocati, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 4.1.0-PTU.9604549.

# Build Info
Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: Evocati Only (Looking to potentially open up to Wave 1 after a few hours of Evo testing if all is well)
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled
- Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
- Server Recovery: Enabled
- Starting aUEC: 15,000,000
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.


# Testing/Feedback Focus
This initial release of 4.1 comes with some pretty dramatic changes to items and recovery. This is a first iteration of item recovery with much more to come in future builds.
- Stability & Bugfixes
- Enabling Orison and Area 18 NPE
- Ground Vehicle & FPS Mining Updates
- New Upcoming Event Mission (Keeping all details limited to test in game communication)

# Features & Gameplay
- **Locations**
**Polish Pass for Hathor Alignment Facilities and Orbital Platforms**
Further Lighting and Art Polish Pass. Work on the exterior overlay, cleaned areas, replaced meshes with more colourful/vibrant alternatives to hopefully reduce the overall "greyness" of the platform, dressed and placed assets around to break up and differentiate the platforms pads.


- **Gameplay**
**Ground Vehicle Mining and FPS mining update**
In preparation for future systems, we have started to prepare the Ground Vehicle mining and FPS mining gameplay to fit our goals.

We split out FPS minables (Aphorite, Dolovine and Hadanite) to not be the minables you will be looking for anymore when you are going mining with your Ground Vehicle miners (like the ROC)
Instead, there are now new minables that are exclusive to the Ground vehicles and FPS mineables separately. They are now categorized as beginner minables, each with their own additional difficulty rating.

**Updated Adjustments to Ground Vehicle Minables**
- Beradon (Easy Beginner minable)
- Glacosite (Medium beginner minables)
- Feynmaline (Hard beginner minable)
- REDACTED (Medium Expert minable)

**Updated adjustments to FPS Hand Mineables**
- Aphorte (Easy Beginner minable)
- Dolivine (Medium beginner minables)
- Hadanite (Hard beginner minable)
- Janalite (Medium Expert minable)
- REDACTED (Medium Professional minable)
- REDACTED (Medium Professional minable)
- REDACTED (Medium Expert minable)

In addition to the changes to the minables themselves, there are now also 4 dedicated mining heads for the ROC that can be bought and exchanged.

These Size 0 mining heads come with their own bespoke balancing and give benefits for: Instability reduction, resistance reduction, optimal charge window parameters, laser power and more (Further descriptions for these items will be in the shops)


# Bug Fixes
- Potential Fix: Aegis Redeemer - PU - Vehicles / Art / Graphics / ReplaceMe - The lower section of the ladder is showing as a replaceme
- Potential Fix: Wikelo Mods - Collector / Missions - The new harvestable ores can't be submitted as mission items
- Potential Fix: PU - Stanton - New Babbage - Missions / UI - NPE / Tutorial - The last Nav Marker before ASOPs can be avoided, causing knock-on Tutorial issues
- Potential Fix: PU - Pyro - Locations / Depots / Collision - Players can be forced under the freight elevator and be pushed through the elevators collision blocking the elevators from being used 
- Potential Fix: Disconnection 30033 is using localization identifier strings instead of human readable messaging
