# **Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.1**
Alpha Patch 4.1 has been released to Evocati, and is now available to test!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.1.0-PTU.9602163.


# Build Info
Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.

- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
- Server Recovery: Enabled
- Starting aUEC: 15,000,000
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

# Features & Gameplay
- **Ships and Vehicles**
- Heavy Fighter General Archetype Balance Pass: Joint health, thruster power, and max speeds have been adjusted for Heavy Fighter Archetypes. Most of these speed and thrust adjustments were needed due to thruster weight changes that have gone into 4.1 and should bring them back in line with 4.0.2 so please keep an eye at Heavy Fighters and let us know if some feel different.
- Landing Gear Rebalance for many ships to help balance their weight distributions
- Argo ATLS: Can now be destroyed. Updated with health and damage states
