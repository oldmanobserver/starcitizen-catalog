# Star Citizen Patch 3.15.0
Alpha Patch 3.15.0 has been released to the LIVE environment, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.15.0-LIVE.7865275.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE. 

Database Reset: Yes
Long Term Persistence: Disabled (Full Long Term Persistence Wipe)
Starting aUEC: 20,000  (Players who participated in the recent XenoThreat will get an additional 100,000 starting aUEC)

We are currently assessing if there are any performance and other issues while playing on Windows 11. If you are part of the windows insider program with Windows 10 or 11, you may have an option turned on called Diagnostic Data in the windows settings. This option is required for windows insider but appears to degrade game performance and turning this off may help framerates substantially.

**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu. Players may need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error.
-     Around Arccorp, if your scattered object distance is set to high you may experience some stuttering. We are working on a fix for this in 3.15.1 but you can fix it now by lowering the scattered object distance setting to medium.
-     Players cannot repair, refuel, and rearm at outposts
-     Items stored in long term persistence such as mined gems are currently not stackable (This is something that will be coming in a future update)
-     After trying on clothing in a store, all equipped items are permanently deleted from the inventory
-     Medical beacon does not complete mission/payment when player is brought back from incapacitation
-     Interacting with the 400i door panels can cause the doors to become unresponsive (Workaround: Back away and retry)
-     Swapping weapons has a chance to drop or remove weapons
-     The Prospector door and ladder lack animations
-     When in combat, NPCs can get stuck in cover when trying to exit
-     Some players may see black squares instead of smoke, clouds, and fog
-     Attempting to deposit gems yields a "transaction error" in Klescher Rehabilitation Facility
-     Announcer audio callout for "Match over. You have won/lost the match" can be heard multiple times at the end of a round in Arena Commander
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment are missing after being released from Klescher

# New Features
Locations
-     Hospitals
Addition of unique hospital locations to Orison, New Babbage, and Grim HEX, and medical clinics into space stations. Here players will be able to regenerate, save new regen locations, heal injuries, and buy medical supplies. Emergency medical elevators have also been added to landing zone hangars to aid in transporting injured players directly to the hospital. For this first iteration, players who originally spawn at Area18 or Lorville will have their default regeneration point set to their corresponding orbital stations. Lorville and Area18 will be getting their hospitals in a future release.
AI
-     Unmanned Missile Defense Turrets 
Addition of AI controlled missile defense turrets at space stations and underground facilities in the PU.

Gameplay
-     Personal Inventory T0 and Asset Manager APP
With the implementation of Personal Inventory, players will now physically store weapons, gadgets, consumables, healing items, and more on their person and in vehicles via backpacks, pockets, and containers. This utilizes the new iCache for persistence wherever players travel. This new system removes the older Equipment Manager app from the mobiGlas and adds a new local inventory system by pressing 'I' on the keyboard (default keybind). Current landing zones share inventories with their low orbit stations above the planets. Tabs allow navigation between Local, Vehicle, External, and Personal inventory. Players can navigate between each tab to move items from one inventory to another (with both sides of the screen displaying an inventory container and the list of available tables). NOTE: Two of the same tabs cannot be open at the same time. When a player places the cursor over any item in their inventory they will be presented with the information given in shops in addition to item specific info; for example ammo displays the remaining bullets in the magazine. Armor and clothing (backpacks, torso and legs) typically have their own inventory container and can be opened by using the inventory system [I]. Placing any of these into a location inventory or into a container will create a nested inventory which can be opened via the RMB over the item. This nested inventory will make it so players are able to store more items onto the player and make space. When right clicking (mouse2) any item in inventory a contextual menu will appear, presenting available interactions, including functions like “split” for stacked items. All armor and clothing can now be carried, dropped, placed and left in the world (currently represented in the environment by carryable boxes); while in this state they can be interacted with using the interaction system, and can be equipped by doing so.

Primary Residence / Initial Location: Before starting the game and initially spawning, a player must now specify their Primary Residence location (where they will initially spawn) via the front end. Friend options to join a party (spawn at their location) are disabled until this location has been set. Any items entitled via store purchases, subscriber rewards etc. will be added to the Primary Residence’s local inventory. Each starting location, Rest stop and Port Olisar have a corresponding local inventory. Items left in the local inventory when the player leaves the location will remain there and cannot be accessed from the inventory UI until the player returns.

Character Inventory: The inventory is no longer restricted to commodities, and can contain any type of FPS armor, clothing, weapon, consumable, and one handed carryable (provided said item fits). The player character is now displayed at the center of the Inventory UI, with a controllable camera (holding mouse2 allows orbit movement via mouse movement, mouse wheel controls zoom), and the ability to drag held and equipped items off of the character into an inventory UI container, and vice versa from an inventory container onto a valid itemport on the character. Items can be dragged and dropped from an inventory container, or from the character, directly onto the floor. Weapon attachments can be dragged directly onto weaponry that is held or equipped to the character. If a player is downed or killed, other players are able to loot items from them via the interaction menu. When a player dies, the items on their body will remain lootable at the location of their death for 2 hours before despawning. Players will be able to choose to loot an individual item by removing just a weapon, armor, container, undersuit, or magazine.

Vehicle Inventory: Every vehicle with a traversable interior has its own Vehicle Inventory accessible while inside that vehicle, with each player aboard having their own instanced Vehicle Inventory. When a vehicle is destroyed, a large cargo box will appear containing any items that had been stored in that vehicle's inventory. Any player will be able to loot the items in this crate via the interaction menu.

Nik Nax Asset Manager: The Nik Nax asset manager is a new mobiGlas app designed to keep track of every item or vehicle a player owns in the universe. The app allows sorting by many options including item locations so that you will be able to quickly determine where you left each of your vehicles, weapons, or that Buster's bar you really wanted.

-     Loot Generation T0 
Addition of systemically generated containers (crates/lockers/boxes) stocked with lootable items throughout the world. The content of these boxes are dynamically generated based on their location with random amounts and types of items.
