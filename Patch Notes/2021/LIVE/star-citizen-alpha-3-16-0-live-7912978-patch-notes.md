# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Gravlev Rework
Gravlev for hovering vehicles (Nox, Dragonfly, ect.) has been heavily revamped and upgraded to improve the feel of driving along with greatly improved general stability and less glitchiness, and and should greatly improve the general experience of driving all around on hover bikes. This includes major updates to the physics model of the bikes, general stability improvements (i.e. not losing control), added turning, banking, and tilting around, and much faster speeds on bikes. Players can now height adjust how far above the surface they are by holding space to go up or CTRL to go down. Doing this will make hovering vehicles that are closer to the ground go faster with more risk of collision and vehicles higher above the ground slower but with less risk of colliding with ground objects. We've added better powered on and off behavior for gravlev vehicles along with improved dismounting behaviors. Falling from great heights no longer should destroy your bike.
-     Atmospheric Bounties
The addition of flying bounties in atmosphere to all Stanton (1,2,3,4), allowing the player to now fight AI bounty targets above planetary locations. These can be in areas above Caves, Derelicts, Junksites, Outposts, and UGFs.
-     UGF Mission Polish
Changed UGF security from police to guards so Assaulting an Officer is not triggered. Greatly increased leniency on damage taken friendly-fire threshold of AI.
-     Law system Improvements 
We've added many additional changes to the law system to help improve it's function in different scenarios.

Defence of another:  All actors and AI will now see someone going over friendly fire thresholds as hostiles for the length of time they have any hostility toward other actors. This is to address the issue of wanting to defend your innocent friend from an unprovoked attack, but not being able due to you receiving a crime stat as the attacker wasn’t hostile to you. It also means we can remove the crime of Aggravated Vehicular Assault which was only added due to the need to mitigate this issue.

Reduce the acquisition of low level CrimeStats: We've removed Aggravated Vehicular Assault as this would still be a crime around green zone covered by Armistice Violations as well as  the addition of Defense of another mechanics mentioned above.

Displaying a victim’s name in infraction notification: This applies to players and any AI with a names. This was to help clear up confusion for players receiving infractions for things like GBH when their victim bled out several seconds after the fact.

Bounty Hunters being led to trespass zone around prison: Replaced the trespass zones are around prison with the new style and removed the misdemeanor area completely. We have reduced the size of the trespass zones, replaced the misdemeanor area with the new trespass type with warns the player and gets them shot at. The felony trespass area is much smaller, but should keep bounty hunters from camping too close to the prison.

Criminals should receive a less forgiving friendly-fire allowance: If a player is already a criminal or has an active hostility timer, the friendly-fire allowance is tightened to ensure they don’t keep getting away with the first few shots.

Missiles and the law: We've made a few changes to missile damage behavior with the law. Firing a locked missile should now max out the friendly-fire hostility duration. Currently locking missile only counts as a “hit”, but it will now render the ship as hostile for as long as a missile is locked. Once the missile is unlocked (without it being fired) it should only add a single “hit”. Fixed an issue that could cause missiles fired at AI to sometimes choose a random friendly target that was close which would cause the player to get an immediate crimestat.
-     Dying Star Updates
Updating the Dying Star map to bring it inline with the recently updated Broken Moon map by increasing overall size, adding new playable areas, more cover options, and new space assets.
-     Updated rep for Infiltrate and defend missions to not punish on player abandon due to the spawn times
-     Temporarily made Scrap sellable at the following RestStop Admin Offices: HUR-L5, CRU-L5, ARC-L1, MIC-L1
Ships and Vehicles
-     Ares Ion Balance Pass
Tweaked the Ares Ion weapon to have a higher RPM with lower damage per hit and made aim adjustments.
-     Redeemer Balance Pass
Adjusted the turret velocities on the Redeemer.
-     Added radars to the Constellation series copilot seats 
Weapons and Items
-     Mounted Guns Polish
Tweaked mounted guns to be more in line as an infantry suppression weapon. This will reduce projectile velocity and RPM, reduce projectile damage per hit, reduce projectile weight (this will reduce force reactions on players), as well as giving projectiles a higher spread. Greatly increased how long players can fire the weapon before it shuts down.
-     Increased cost of Size 10 bombs
