# New Features
Gameplay
-     Ship To Station Docking
Adding the ability for players to dock large ships to docking ports at space stations. Including various related work such as having ATC assign you docking ports when appropriate, new docking connectors, and new lobbies in space stations for large ships to connect to. This initial implementation will give docking access to the 890 Jump and Hammerhead. Players can ASOP spawn or hail the station like before and be assigned a docking port instead of a hangar with these ships. While docking, hailing the station will assign a docking port and bring up the docking interface for players to align their ship's docking port to the docking collar either manually or using the auto-land system by holding N (default).
