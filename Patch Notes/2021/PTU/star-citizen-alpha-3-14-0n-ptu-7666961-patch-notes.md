Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Testing Focus**
-     Crusader
-     Orison Landing Zone
-     Constellation Taurus
-     Law System v2: Surrender
-     Power Management v2 (Capacitor Gameplay)
-     Missile Operator Mode
-     Radar, Scanning, and Ping T0
**Known Issues**
-     Quantum traveling to Crusader will place your ship inside the atmosphere, preventing further quantum travel
**This issue is caused by an incorrect obstruction radius around Crusader. This will be resolved in the next PTU release (most likely after the weekend) to place it closer to 150km instead of 750km above the planet. For now leaving atmosphere when at Orison may take much longer than intended. This may also make spline jumps to Orison impossible for now.**
-     Gas Clouds on Crusader appear to have moving graphical artifacts that appear as dots. Current clouds are still in development and not final. See note at the top of patch notes.
