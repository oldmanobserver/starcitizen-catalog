**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu
Players will need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error. This is part of the bug where players used to see a Bad Token after a crash which blocked them from re-entering but with the latest changes, that error is no longer displayed.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Inventory Polish Pass
Added the ability to unselect a quick filter by clicking it again. Update category filter state when changing the custom filters so they match. Added loot option when interacting with downed player backpacks. Added new contextual option to Equip All from stack to available item ports.
-     Healing, Downed State, and Medical Polish Pass
New Wear Damage threshold, which once reached, received wear damage should trigger a % chance to trigger the next injury severity. Chance to trigger next injury severity will increase as the wear damage approaches the 100% threshold with a cooldown on how frequently this can trigger. Added toggle control widget on the curelife medical tool should now have hover selected, click feedback, and added icon click animation. Added new healing beacon HUD displays for Help is on the way (when the mission is accepted) and Rescue aborted - awaiting response to new beacon (when the mission was abandoned). This will display updates to Revival service beacon acceptance status & auto-trigger a subsequent beacon if the first is abandoned. Players will now be considered as fully killed if they disconnect from a server while in a downed state. 
-     Broken Moon AC Polish
Removed volumetric clouds from Broken Moon to help increase performance. Redout effect when reaching the edge of the playable area will now start as minimal and increase in severity the longer the player is out of bounds.
