Ships and Vehicles
-     ROC-DS Balance pass
Updated ROC-DS with a unique mining head that improves it's mining/tractor range and power. Increased cargo capacity.
-     Ship in Ship Docking ASOP and Parasite Ship Changes
We've made a few temporary changes to how parasite ships such as the p-52 and p-72 are handled for insurance and ASOP spawning. Where ships are granted to the player because the ship (Example: Merlin on a Connie), is part of the ship's default loadout, that secondary "attached' ship should no longer be treated as a separate ship from the ASOP's point of view. Because of this, they will no longer be spawnable via the ASOP unless you have bought in game or pledged for these smaller ships separately. Merlins (and other loadout based ships), will always be claimed by claiming their parent ship and is the only way to replenish them if destroyed. If a party member/friend/anyone is flying your docked Merlin and you make a claim on the Connie, the previous instance of the parasite ship your friend/party member is flying will immediately be considered as a stolen vehicle. Doing this will give the pilot of it a crime stat for stealing a ship.
