**Testing Focus**
-     General gameplay and stability
**Known Issues**
-     Upon launching the game, the player may receive a 16008 error (Most likely requires a character reset and logging out of the launcher)
-     After logging out in a ship bed or crashing, logging in can result in Error 20018 or a long loading screen where ship/player spawns at Stanton star (Most likely requires a character reset and logging out of the launcher)
-     After a server connection timeout (Error 30K), a "Bad Token" error may be presented, preventing loading back into the Persistent Universe (requires game restart to workaround issue)
-     Star Citizen may crash immediately after pressing "Launch Game" in the Launcher (Recent potential app conflicts: Acronis Active Protection, Comodo, Sonic Studio Contact RSI Technical Support if the issue persists)
-     Elevators or environment content will occasionally be missing in the PU
-     Players are unable to leave a party from the Main Menu (Workaround: Open Star Marine Multiplayer (any mode) > select "Invite" > select "Leave Party" > exit back to main menu)
-     The chat window is positioned too low to be fully readable whilst in a vehicle on Ultrawide monitors
-     Using a medipen may occasionally have no effect
-     Swapping FPS weapons drops or removes the original weapon

-     Demon Fang Combat Knife asset is missing from the game
-     When entering the pilot's seat of the 100i, the animation may not complete, leaving the player facing away from the windscreen
-     Occasionally, the Quantum Drive may start spooling with no known cause
-     Sometimes, after spooling and calibrating the Quantum Drive and attempting to initiate the jump, nothing happens (Workaround: Move ship reticle away, then move back to recalibrate)
