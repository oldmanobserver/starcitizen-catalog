**Known Issues**
-     Ships sometimes wont appear in the VMA app unless the player spawns the ship first then spawns a different ship after, only then the ship will appear in VMA
-     PVE Bounty Target name may not match the target name given in the contract. Killing this ship before it is given a proper name (so it still has a long name ending in numbers) you will not complete the mission as the pilot.

-     The doors leading into the Orison Cloudview Center Arcade will not open from the outside
-     Pressing and holding F to "Freelook" does not work when piloting the Nox and prevents start up of vehicle using interaction (keybind will need to be used)
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment are missing after being released from Klescher
-     Bed logging on a moon or planet - ship falls through surface
-     Hammerhead doors to turrets may not open for players if they leave the seat during QT, trapping them inside
-     The Emergency Elevators do not send a valid player to the hospital once the Admit Patients UI has been activated, remains stuck on "Checking Availability"
-     Multiple Heavy Armor Arms Clip/Partially Obscure some of the mobiGlas Icons
-     Weapon will not holster
