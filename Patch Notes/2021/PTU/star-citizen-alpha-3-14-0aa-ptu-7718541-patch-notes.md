-     After a server connection timeout (Error 30K), a "Bad Token" error may be presented, preventing loading back into the Persistent Universe (requires game restart to workaround issue)
-     Star Citizen may crash immediately after pressing "Launch Game" in the Launcher (Recent potential app conflicts: Acronis Active Protection, Comodo, Sonic Studio Contact RSI Technical Support if the issue persists)
-     Elevators or environment content will occasionally be missing in the PU
-     Players are unable to leave a party from the Main Menu (Workaround: Open Star Marine Multiplayer (any mode) > select "Invite" > select "Leave Party" > exit back to main menu)
-     The chat window is positioned too low to be fully readable whilst in a vehicle on Ultrawide monitors
-     Using a medipen may occasionally have no effect
-     Swapping FPS weapons drops or removes the original weapon
-     Mineable commodities data in Scan Mode displays incorrect Percentage Values
-     The player may become unable to open Hammerhead turret doors, leaving them trapped inside

-     Search missions such as shipment lost and lost cargo do not update once the player has collected the cargo box
-     Unable to complete box delivery missions in Area18, as kiosk rejects boxes
-     Demon Fang Combat Knife asset is missing from the game
-     When entering the pilot's seat of the 100i, the animation may not complete, leaving the player facing away from the windscreen
-     Occasionally, the Quantum Drive may start spooling with no known cause
-     Sometimes, after spooling and calibrating the Quantum Drive and attempting to initiate the jump, nothing happens (Workaround: Move ship reticle away, then move back to recalibrate)
