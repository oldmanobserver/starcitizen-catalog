We are currently assessing any performance and other issues while playing on Windows 11. If you are part of the windows insider program or have much lower FPS than than you did in windows 10, you may have an option turned on called Diagnostic Data in the windows settings. This option is required for windows insider but appears to degrade game performance and turning this off may help framerates substantially.

**Testing Focus**
-     Server Crash Ship Recovery
-     Healing and Actor Status
-     Hospitals
-     Starlifter Hercules A2
-     Origin 400i

Known Issues
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu. Players may need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error.

-     Players cannot repair, refuel, and rearm at outposts
-     Items not stored in long term persistence such as mined gems are currently not stackable (This is something that will be coming in a future update)
-     After trying on clothing in a store, all equipped items are permanently deleted from the inventory
-     Medical beacon does not complete mission/payment when player is brought back from incapacitation
-     Interacting with the 400i door panels can cause the doors to become unresponsive (Workaround: Back away and retry)
-     Swapping weapons has a chance to drop or remove weapons
-     The Prospector door and ladder lack animations
-     When in combat, NPCs can get stuck in cover when trying to exit
-     Some players may see black squares instead of smoke, clouds, and fog
-     Attempting to deposit gems yields a "transaction error" in Klescher Rehabilitation Facility
-     Items looted from the corpse of someone sent to prison may be lost and sent back to the prisoner
-     Announcer audio callout for "Match over. You have won/lost the match" can be heard multiple times at the end of a round in Arena Commander
