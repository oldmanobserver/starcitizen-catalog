Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Testing Focus**
-     Crusader
-     Orison Landing Zone
-     Constellation Taurus
-     Law System v2: Surrender
-     Power Management v2 (Capacitor Gameplay)
-     Missile Operator Mode
-     Radar, Scanning, and Ping T0
**Known Issues**
-     Gas Clouds on Crusader appear to have moving graphical artifacts that appear as dots. Current clouds are still in development and not final. See note at the top of patch notes.
- Quantum traveling to Crusader will place your ship inside the atmosphere, preventing further quantum travel
- QT from Port Olisar to Comm Array ST2-55 will cause ship to QT to a different direction
- Assets such as Elevators or Environment content will occasionally be missing in the PU. These assets take time to load in for clients causing players to fall through Elevators or being unable to leave locations
-     Orison objects & textures loading very slowly
-     Missiles do not follow flares as a countermeasure
-     Various UI markers are faded and hard to read
-     Shield is getting hit multiple times on a single distortion explosion
-     Ships are not fully repaired after repairing / refueling them in VMS
-     Banu Defender Power Triangle does not change
-     Demon Fang Combat Knife asset is missing from the game
-     Editing PMA After Changing mobiGlas case prevents mobiglas functionality
# Feature Updates
Gameplay

Updated assisted gimbal tracking speed and slightly increased its snapping. Slightly lowered damage and increased ammo for ballistic repeaters and gatlings. Polish pass on damage values for Vanguard specific weapons. Buffed the health of the Vanguard Harbinger. Removed "ammo low" ship computer lines playing for energy weapons. Removed overheat from ship thrusters.

Ships and Vehicles

Polish pass on ship hud to help players differentiate between targeted hostiles & non-targeted hostile UI markers at the edge of cockpit views
