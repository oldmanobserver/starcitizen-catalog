**Testing Focus**
Personal inventory is still undergoing UI changes as we progress through PTU. A feedback thread will be opened at a later time once it is in a more complete state.
-     Healing and Actor Status
-     Hospitals
-     Starlifter Hercules A2
-     Bombs
-     Infiltrate and Defend Missions
-     Loot Generation
-     Orison V2
-     Arena Commander Revamp
**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu
Players will need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error. This is part of the bug where players used to see a Bad Token after a crash which blocked them from re-entering but with the latest changes, that error is no longer displayed.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.
-     Resetting account failed to clear user items

# New Features
Locations
-     Hospitals
Addition of unique location hospitals to landing zones and clinics into space stations where players will be able to respawn, save new spawn locations, heal injuries, and buy medical supplies from these locations. This adds the additional emergency elevator inside landing zone hangars that will transport players directly to the hospital. This first iteration will have hospitals in Orison, New Babbage, Grim HEX, and clinics in space stations. Players who originally spawn in this first iteration at Area18 and Lorville will have their default hospital set to their corresponding orbital stations. Lorville and Area18 will be getting their hospitals in a future release.

AI
-     Unmanned Missile Defense Turrets 
Addition of AI controlled defense turrets at space stations and underground facilities in the PU.

Gameplay
-     Personal Inventory T0 and Asset Manager app
Note on inventory: Elements of the inventory UI are still work in progress with many updates upcoming.  We will be opening a feedback thread on this topic on a later date, so stay tuned!  In addition, there are some issues we recognize that need to be resolved and are actively being worked on for future iterations including losing inventory within a ship after a server crash and the loss of account linked items like subscriber flair.

With the implementation of Personal Inventory, players will now physically store weapons, gadgets, consumables, healing items, and more on their person and in vehicles via backpacks, pockets, and containers. This utilizes the new iCache for persistence wherever players travel. This new system removes the older inventory app from the mobiGlas and adds a new local inventory system by pressing 'I' on the keyboard (default keybind). Currently landing zones share inventories with their low orbit stations above the planets. Tabs allow navigation between Location, Vehicle, External, and Personal inventory. Players can navigate between each tab to move items from one inventory to another (with both sides of the screen displaying an inventory container and the list of available tables). NOTE: Two of the same tabs cannot be open at the same time. When a player places the cursor over any item in their inventory they will be presented with the information given in shops, next to the tooltips on ammo is remaining bullets of the magazine. Armour & clothing (backpacks, torso and legs) typically have their own inventory container and can be opened by using the inventory system [I]. Placing any of these into a location inventory or into a container will create a nested inventory which can be opened via the RMB over the item. This nested inventory will make it so players are able to store more items onto the player and make space. When right clicking (mouse2) any item in inventory a contextual menu will appear, presenting available interactions, including functions like “split” for stacked items. All armor and clothing can now be carried, dropped, placed and left in the world (currently represented in the environment by carryable boxes); while in this state they can be interacted with using the interaction system, and can be equipped by doing so.

Home / Initial location: Before starting the game and initially spawning, a player must now specify their Home location (where they will initially spawn) via the front end. Friend options to join party (spawn at their location) are disabled until this location has been set. Any items entitled via store purchases, subscriber rewards etc. will be added to the Home location’s location inventory. Each starting location, Rest stop and Port Olisar have a corresponding Location Inventory. If items are left in the location inventory when the player leaves said location, then the items will remain at the location and cannot be accessed from the inventory UI until the player returns.

Character Inventory: The inventory is no longer restricted to commodities, and can contain any type of FPS armor, clothing, weapon, consumable, and 1h carryable (provided said item fits). The player character is now displayed at the center of the Inventory UI, with a controllable camera (holding mouse2 allows orbit movement via mouse movement, mouse wheel controls zoom), and the ability to drag held and equipped items off of the character into an inventory UI container, and vice versa from an inventory container onto a valid itemport on the character. Items can be dragged and dropped from an inventory container, or from the character, directly onto the floor. Weapon attachments can be dragged directly onto weaponry that is held or equipped to the character. If a player is downed or killed other players are able to loot via the interaction menu and take all items from the player. When a player dies, their body will become lootable by players for all the items they had on them at the location of their death for 2 hours before despawning. If they just want an individual item then they will be able to remove the weapon, armor, container, undersuit, or magazine.

Vehicle Inventory: Each ship and ground vehicle with a traversable interior has its own Vehicle Inventory, which is only accessible whilst inside said vehicle. Any player can access their own instanced vehicle inventory when inside. When a ship has inventory in it and players self-destruct or have the ship destroyed, a large cargo box will appear that will allow any player to loot the items via the interaction menu.

Nik Nax Asset Manager: The Nik Nax asset manager is a new mobiGlas app designed to keep track of every item or ship a player owns in the universe. This allows sorting by many options including item locations so that you will be able to quickly determine where each of your ships, weapons, or where you left that Buster's bar you really wanted!
-     Loot Generation T0 
Addition of containers into the PU that players should be able to find systemically generated containers (crates/lockers/boxes) that contain loot throughout the world. The content of the boxes is dynamically generated with random amounts and types of items, depending on the location.
