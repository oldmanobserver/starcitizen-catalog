Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Testing Focus**
-     Crusader
-     Orison Landing Zone
-     Constellation Taurus
-     Law System v2: Surrender
-     Power Management v2 (Capacitor Gameplay)
-     Missile Operator Mode
-     Radar, Scanning, and Ping T0
