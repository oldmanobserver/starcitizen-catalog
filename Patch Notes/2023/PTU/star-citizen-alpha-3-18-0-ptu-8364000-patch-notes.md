# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Ultrawide QoL Updates
Added new Visor support for various aspect rations + high field of views. Added 4:3, 16:9, 21:9, 32:9, 48:9 visor meshes which gets swapped out based on current aspect ratio. Visor mesh will be dynamically aligned onto the camera surface ("dynamic FOV offsets") so it will always encompass the whole screen. No more custom horizontal FOVs based on aspect ratio > Will be calculated automatically from vertical limits now. Increased vertical fov limit from 54-67 to 54-90 since it's working now with the dynamic visor. Fixed black bands/low res visor in area18
