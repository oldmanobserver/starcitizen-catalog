# New Features
Core Tech
-     HDR Implementation
High dynamic range (HDR) is now enabled for players with a compatible monitor. This is activated in Windows by going to the 'Windows Display Settings' and selecting 'Use HDR'. Then, open Star Citizen and select 'HDR' in the 'Graphics tab'. Note: If you are experiencing issues with HDR and submit/add to an IC ticket, please give details about your monitor and model# so the team can help track down issues.


# Feature Updates
Gameplay
- Updated Keybinds for opening mobiGlas and Scanning
We have updated the default keybinds opening the mobiGlas and ship scanning.  MobiGlas is now opened/closed with TAB while on foot while still F1 in ship cockpits (fixed to be TAB in a later build), while scanning is now V (long hold), Arena Commander Scoreboard = Tab.
-     MFD Persistence
Custom Vehicle MFD selections should now persist for as long as you keep the vehicle intact. Players should only have to set MFD menu selection once per vehicle but losing and insurance claiming it will create a new vehicle, thus losing the saved custom MFD.
-     Mobiglas Background and Darkness Occlusion
Visual updates to help the mobiGlas more readable on bright backgrounds. Vehicle/Ship HUD and other selective UI is now hidden while opening the mobiGlas in a pilot seat.
-     Slightly adjusted the Combat Logging Messaging
Core Tech
-     Made Several Server Performance Improvements
