# Feature Updates
Ships and Vehicles
-     Server Crash Recovery QoL Update
Server Crash Recovery has been updated for PES to now remember the last location the ship hailed for landing and landed/docked at. This will allow players who hit a server crash to have their ship spawn back at the last hailed location instead of their chosen home location where the landing area may not be equipped to handle their ships, such as a fully loaded or extended Hull-C.
-     Greatly increased the Hull-C Hull health
