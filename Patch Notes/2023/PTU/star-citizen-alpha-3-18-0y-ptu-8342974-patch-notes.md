**Known Issues**
> There is a pretty severe issue in this build where players will more likely than not get an infinite load after any death in the PU. The workaround for this is that you will have to either exit the game and reload after a death when this occurs or use the character repair tool on the PTU website if that doesn't fix the issue. This bug isn't quite 100% but it appears to be a vast majority of player deaths when it happens. 
> With this said, we are releasing this build with the caveat that it might not survive the night and will have to be pulled down if it becomes too severe.
