# Siege of Orison Mission Updates
- Siege now has a warning period for the event, when this initially starts there will be a 30 min warning where Dulli will say something is going down, this is to allow people to prep and accept the mission to know where its taking place
- The lift from Orison to the rooftop will be disabled by default and only enabled when the event starts.
- All the shuttle call terminals require the lieutenant’s code to be input one time to unlock.
- Example would be the shuttle from Easy to Medium islands should use Solanki Boss' code, this includes if you managed to unlock it from Medium island.
- The only one that won’t have a code is the broken shuttle from H to E island.
- The barge now has a container that will prevent people from pushing into the barge beyond the first room. This becomes unlocked when all the previous Islands boss' have been complete
- If you take a Siege Ship out of the area while the event is active we active self destruct that the player can not turn off
- If you get back in the area it should disable the self-destruct
- Once the IFFI on the barge is down, players will be free to take the ships as the Self-Distruct will be disabled
- If you try and take your own ship into the area, you will be impounded back to “the last ATC the player was near"
- There have been changes under the hood to turrets and the way the IFFI interact
- If a player commits a crime or attacks another player on the mission they will get a marker placed on them and players still in the mission will be allowed to kill them, with this they will see an objective to do with Nine tails sympathizers and how many have been killed
You only see markers for sympathizers on the same island as you
- When you kill the island lieutenant and loot the code you will get a marker on potential IFFI locations
- We have new audio lines
- If the player approaches an island and the lieutenant is killed but the AA isn't disabled
- If you are heading to an island and there are Ninetails sympathizers on that island
- Along with one saying about more than 1
- New mission success line
- New line saying the lieutenant is dead and the iffi is optional they can move on
- A line for the possible IFFI locations
- Personal thank you to the player for doing the event
- If a player kills another player everyone on that island gets informed, there is also a repeat line for this.
- Fail reason strings have been added to all relevant objectives and the overall mission fails
