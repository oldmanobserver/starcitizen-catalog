Ships and Vehicles
-     Added Avenger Renegade, Sabre Comet, Gladius Valiant, C8 Pisces, F7C Wildfire, MISC Hull A, STV, and RSI Scorpius into in-game shops
Core Tech
-     Widescreen QoL Changes
Addition of some quality of life changes for Widescreen monitor players. Keep vertical FOV but scale horizontal FOV if resolution becomes ultra-wide. Updated FOV slider with new values for current resolution. Added new 32:9 Aspect Ratio in FovGlobalSettings which had a too narrow one being calculated resulting in a clipped visor. Completely disabled the behavior that the chat moves down when entering a ship, since it's not very useful and can even be reset when resolution changes. Inventory overhaul for widescreen with items and scaling no longer being cropped on ultra widescreen resolutions.
