# Feature Updates
Characters
-     Updated Hair Art and Geometry Polish Pass
Locations
-         Inhabited Derelict Settlements
Inclusion of 15 new Derelict Settlements with both mission gameplay, social elements, and shops. These new inhabited settlements are spread throughout the wildernesses of Hurston and microTech using the Rastar tool with a larger, expanded library of new and existing assets. Some locations are accessible via the Starmap while other new settlements are more discrete and appear behind missions. All NPCs at these locations are neutral, making up a population of independent civilians and members of the Dusters faction and have been updated to use the new hair tech and faction clothing.

 - New Hurston Locations Include: Zephyr, Maker’s Point, Ludlow, Pickers Field, Finn’s Folly, Weeping Cove, Cutter’s Rig, and Rappel.
 - New MicroTech Locations Include: Frostbite, Razor’s Edge, Bloodshot Ridge, Harper’s Point, Astor’s Clearing, Moreland Hills, and Dunboro.

Gameplay
-     Inventory: Openable Cargo Containers
3.22 adds openable cargo containers, allowing players to be able to store commodities and items in. These new 1, 2, 4, and 8 SCU containers can be purchased and sold through shops and dropped from your location inventory into your ship cargo grid. These new cargo containers allow contents to be sold individually, as well as the containers themselves, in which case any unsold contents will be sent to the inventory the container is being held in.

This also includes work for tractor beams that will make it so cargo is locked onto cargo grids when the ship is locked by the door integrity. Meaning as long as the integrity is sufficient, cargo cannot be removed from cargo grids except by the owner or party members. It is considered a law infraction if Stolen off a cargo grid in a Monitored Zone.
-     Structural Salvage Balance Pass
Overall balance pass to put Structure Salvage earnings more in line with what is intended. This update will increase the base amount of time it takes to run disintegration and fracturing, reduce the amount of construction materials gained, and reduce the internal storage buffer of the Reclaimer to 140 SCU and the Vulture to 12 SCU. Along with this comes another mechanic to slightly offset those changes to be more skill based. This includes an "alignment field" that reduces the time it takes for disintegration as well as giving more material depending on the distance that player is from the "ideal spot".
-     Structural Salvage UI and VFX Polish Pass
-     Temporarily removed the Hull-A from salvage mission pools
