# Feature Updates
Locations
-     Lorville No Fly Zone, Performance, Collision, and VFX Polish Pass

AI
-     FPS AI Combat Balance
With 3.19 comes a quality of life overhaul of FPS AI accuracy and behavior. This is intended to make AI feel a bit more realistic, lifelike, and in some ways more forgiving without pinpoint, deadly accuracy at all times, which is something that has caused many of us much frustration while clearing out baddies from underground facilities.

NPCs should now have a better range of accuracy modifiers, which will ramp up accuracy based on many factors like seeing and losing sight of target, how long the enemy sees it's target after regaining sigh on them, mercy times to assess how much of a threat the target it, and their loadouts. This also implements firing duration and cooldown for rapid fire and other checks with mercy timers that adjust accuracy when determining if a player is a threat or not.

Gameplay
-     Ghost Hollow PVP Mission Balance
Increased maximum amount per terminal. Decreased time between ticks. Increased base tick amount by 50% (100 to 150) and increases more overtime. Increased amount after changing user to 75% (from 50%). Reduced the maximum reset cooldown.
-     Mining Sub Items Can Are Now Grabbable and Storable in Inventories
-     Updated Mining UI With better Volatile Cargo Warnings

Core Tech
-     NPC Performance Optimizations
We will be monitoring and collecting data on this NPC fix that. We are hopeful this may help with a few other issues as well but are holding off expectations until we can get it out on the PTU with you all for a while to monitor.
