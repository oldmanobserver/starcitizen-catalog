**Testing Focus**
3.18.1 implements multiple new systems that should significantly reduce strain on the backend which were causing various issues with inventory, entitlements, and account loading. This also accumulates the numerous hotfixes that have been applied to LIVE over the last couple weeks along with a new database.
-     New Ship Delivery System
-     General Stability and bug
Weekend Stress Playtests on PTU! This weekend we will have multiple 1 hour concurrency tests where we are trying to get as many people in as possible to stress the database services to see how well they are behaving and logging issues as they occur to address them.

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Initial Ship Delivery
This change we are making affects how you obtain your vehicle when logging into the game for the first time after a database reset. Instead of being immediately entitled to your home location in-game, ship pledges on our website will now be available at any ASOP terminal labeled as "Deliverable". You can make your ship available at the location for the first time by pressing the "Deliver" button, which functions similarly to the standard insurance claim but is free and only takes about 20 seconds. Once delivered that ship will be available to customize and be used. This change will help address entitlement database spam when new accounts are entering the PU for for the first time.
-     Arena Commander Customization Temporarily Disabled
We have implimented improvements to the API that manages ship customization in Arena Commander and are exploring more, which we believe will further alleviate issues with entitlement. While these changes are being tested, ship customization in Arena Commander will be temporarily disabled for 3.18.1. You will still be able to select ships from your hangar as well as REC rentals, however. We will be providing several vehicle loadout changes in AC that you can use in the meantime with upgraded shield generators and weaponry that we've hand selected. This will temporarily update the loadouts of the base Gladius, Arrow, and Blade. This change will be temporary; customization will be reenabled in the following update. The next update will also include general fixes that didn't make it for 3.18.1's release and/or were blocked by issues with Persistent Entity Streaming.


# Bug Fixes
-     Fixed - Players crashing out/quits mid using an ASOP terminal will brick it and make it unusable
-     Fixed - Arena Commander - Swarm - Player is unable to pick-up/interact with repair icon
-     Fixed - Ships - Cockpit - Actor animations - Occasionally unable to exit ship seat
-     Fixed - GPU - VFX / Locations - Gas clouds are causing a memory leak for players when observed
-     Fixed - Arena Commander - Players leaving during ready up causing incorrect waiting for players count and ready count
-     Fixed Various issues in Arena Commander where the waiting for players count would fall below 0 which would cause the match to never start
-     Fixed Issue where several player would join which would break the ready up system in Arena Commander

# Technical
We've made many dramatic changes to how the ASOP, client, server, and global databases handle entities and entitlements which should help address many of the various issues players have been seeing. While this isn't the complete resolution to the entitlement disruptions we are seeing, this should improve the experience overall.
-     Fixed 2 Client Crashes
-     Fixed 1 Server Crashes
