# New Features

Locations
-     New Jump Point Rest Stop Stations and Lagrange Points
Addition of 3 additional Rest Stops to Stanton that act as the final stop before entering Jump Points. Each location is set up similarly to all the other Lagrange Points and consists of a parent Gas Cloud, a smaller Child Gas Cloud, a Gateway Rest Stop and and structures leading to the Jump Point itself. It is important to note that Jump Points are currently non-functional in 3.21 as Stanton is the only available system at this time.

These 3 new Stations with Jump Points that leave the Stanton System are: 
- Pyro Gateway - (Stanton>Pyro)
- Magnus Gateway - (Stanton>Magnus)
- Terra Gateway - (Stanton>Terra)


Gameplay
-     New Legal/Illegal Mission: Retrieve Consignment 
In this new mission type, player’s will be challenged to go to the Underground Facilities (UGFs) and kill / search for data pads that contain consignments depending on the mission variant. A consignment will have a code on the top for the dispenser which will cause the items listed on its manifest to come out of the dispenser one by one. These items can be taken and sold at commodity kiosk’s around the game for aUEC, this is however optional and players only need to retrieve these items from the dispenser to make way for the mission critical items if they so please. This mission will take part exclusively at the security UGFs, are shareable, and will require the drop-off of at least one box of classified files to complete the mission.

The Illegal version of this mission is offered by Ruto and the Legal version of this mission is offered by the various Security Organizations of Stanton.
- The Legal version of the mission the player will find corpses of dead security at the facility on arrival. On these corpses will be the data pads and the player will have to deal with Ninetails defending the location they have overrun.
- The Illegal version of the mission there will be no corpses, just security at the location which will drop the data pads as loot when killed.

This mission also introduces a new mission module called the AnteUpWaveSpawner, this module will cause AI to continuously spawn in waves at the location. These waves get progressively harder based on triggers, the triggers for this mission are Codes being successfully entered into the dispenser and every 5 minutes the player is at the location(on a looping timer). On this mission the waves will start to spawn once the first boss is killed.
-     New Illegal Mission: Kareah - Steal Evidence

With this new Steal Evidence mission offered by Twitch, players are tasked with stealing the next Evidence item that spawns from the Kareah contraband dispenser. To obtain this mission, players must talk to Twitch in person after completing her intro mission and having climbing in reputation. Only one instance can be active on the server at any time.

The first objective simply states to retrieve the Evidence, which will place a marker on the evidence dispenser. The mission description in the MobiGlas has a brief explanation on how to get the access code for the dispenser. When a box of evidence is spawned, the marker moves from the dispenser to the evidence, objective stays the same. Once the box of evidence has been grabbed by a mission player, the delivery destination is marked. If the box of evidence is taken away by another non-mission player, the marker will stay on it to allow recovery of the box by mission players.
