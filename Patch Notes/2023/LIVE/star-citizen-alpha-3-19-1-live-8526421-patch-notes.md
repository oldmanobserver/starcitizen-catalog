# Star Citizen Patch 3.19.1
Alpha Patch 3.19.1 has been released to the LIVE, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.19.1-LIVE.8526421.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER and Shader folders for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE. The Shader folders can be found here %localappdata%\Star Citizen.

Database Reset: Yes
Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 20,000

**Known Issues**
Going into 3.19.1 we are not performing an LTP wipe. With that said, Persistent Entity Streaming and going into 3.19.0 has created a few knock-ons with how Long Term Persistence is behaving which may cause some items to go missing without certain steps taken. These major issues are now resolved in 3.19.1 but we wanted to point toward our previous thread about this to help give anyone who missed out an understanding about what has happened in case some items do go missing.

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     ASOP Technical Refactor
With 3.19.1 comes a technical refactor to ASOPs. While this is a mostly transparent update under the hood, itdoes have a few key directly observable advantages and fixes.

Key changes for this refactor are the removal of waiting for ship spawning. Ship delivery time is now 0 by default. Optimized the update of on screen information by not having to re-query the list after a ship's state changed. Fixed multiple buttons being displayed on top of each others. Fixed bad ship states when opening the terminal while having pending queries. Removal of ATC location assignment delays. Removed static delay when calling ATC. Fixed impounding fees that were not being applied. Fixed ATC getting stuck in a bad state upon a failed unstow request and handling of ASOP screen when unstow fails. Prevent multiple spawns in ASOP so players cannot accidentally spawn the same ship twice causing the previous ones to become impounded. Speed up fade when accessing ASOP. Fixed "unknown" state after a ship was stored while looking at the terminal, giving the "claim" button. Fixed wrong selected ship index when moving the mouse after having pressed a button. Adjusted alpha of disabled button state on the ASOP. Change "Transferring to Storage" with "Moving to Storage" as the string was 1 character too long and the first word was split on the UI. Added time remaining to the ASOP status column when a ship is being delivered. Fixed multiple ship highlight selection when moving cursor fast over the vehicle list. Fixed red message showing up at random times indicating an error.
-     Tractor Beam QoL
Now Ignores rotation when attaching Mining items, gimbal, salvage items, and rockets.
-     Mineable Scanning Update
Made it so that the scan results on the mining HUD account for active laser modifiers, without having to shoot the mineable with the laser.

Ships and Vehicles

Made Improvements to Rotational Performance and Fuel Usage
