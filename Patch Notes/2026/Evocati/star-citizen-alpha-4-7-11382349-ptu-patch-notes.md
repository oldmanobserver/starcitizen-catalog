# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.7
Alpha Patch 4.7 has been released to Evocati, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 4.7.0-PTU.11382349.
- Audience: Evocati Only (Standard ETF NDA - Talk but no show)
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled (Please let us know of any early LTP issues between ptu builds)
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing and subject to removal.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.



# Testing/Feedback Focus
Tonight’s focus will be mostly on the integration of Inventory and Crafting from our previous Evo tech-previews. Stanton is back as well! Operation Breaker Stations will be blocked tonight due to the fuse issues.
- Stability, Bugfixes, LTP between PTU releases
- Operation Breaker Station and Locations (mission flow most likely blocked by fuse known issue in this build)
- Inventory Rework Inclusions
- Crafting Inclusions
