# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Industrial Salvage and Mining Missions**
Industrial Resource Gathering missions introduce a new mission type where factions contract you to acquire specific resources through various industrial gameplay loops. Unlike cargo hauling where shipments are provided, these missions require you to locate and gather the requested materials yourself using mining, refining, salvaging, scavenging, gathering, and even pirating activities across the Stanton, Pyro, and Nyx systems.

**Core Gameplay**
Accept contracts requesting specific resources from mission givers and deliver to the requested location through the freight elevator
- Mining: Extract minerals and raw ores using FPS mining tools, ground vehicles (ROC), or mining ships (Prospector, MOLE)
- Salvaging: Scrape hulls for RMC, disintegrate ship structures for rubble/parts, or scavenge vehicle components from wrecks
- Refining: Process raw ores sand scraps into refined materials at refinery stations
**Mission Providers & Reputation**
- Shubin Interstellar: Specializes in mining and refining contracts. Build reputation to unlock more challenging mining missions with better rewards
- Adagio Holdings: Focuses on salvage and construction material contracts. Progress through reputation ranks to access expert salvaging opportunities
