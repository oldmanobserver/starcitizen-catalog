# Features & Gameplay
> Gameplay
**Refueling Updates**
Refueling pods have had a sizeable SCU increase to hold nearly twice as much as before.  Added many blueprints for refueling nozzles to missions. 

**Vehicle Recovery**
Balance adjustments to vehicle recovery claim timers and aUEC costs for nearly all ships 

**Tactical Strike Groups**
Added radiation hazards to interior of station. Decreased entryway size.  
> Ships & Vehicles
**Ship Armor and Shield Balance**
Upwards adjustments have been made to armor deflection of larger ships, including cap ships. Updated the ships sitting between heavy fighters and large ships like the hammerhead to have their own armor balancing (Such as Redeemer and Constellation series). Shield updates to shield components across the board to adjust health, shield resistance, and health regen. This update will see most shields have a health pool reduction around 20% while most shield regen speeds increased.

**Ship Weapon/Ammo Adjustments**
Ballistic ammo SCU sizes have been greatly reduced to about 10% of their previous cargo sizes. Attrition Weapons have had a balance pass to reduce their damage by a significant amount while increasing heat per second and increasing charge up time.

**Ship Component and Munitions Price Balance**
With tonight’s update you will see wide pricing updates to ship components, weapons, and munitions. This will see many components get increases to cost while some will have significant reductions in price such as certain fuel tanks, missiles, torps, and more.
> **Weapons & Items**
**Flight Suit location adjustments**
Added flightsuits to indy tradeposts in Pyro. Added flightsuit and helmet to small and medium CFP Trader inventories. Swapped Flightsuit in Area18 Cubby Blast for MRAI Flight Suit
> **Core Tech**
New VR Updates
F Prompts are rendered in world now and no longer in screenspace so they work natively with VR
Adding new 3D FPS Crosshair and Hitmarkers for VR. Enabled via cvar w_crosshair_3d which is on by default for VR  
- Note: The new 3D Crosshair looks very similar albeit not identical to the 2D version. Also the 3D version doesn't do any smoothing to it which feels more natural in VR and is tricky to do in 3d space so it still feels responsive enough for FPS  
- The Crosshair is also aligned to the weapon helper and no longer in screenspace, i.e. if you lean to the right the crosshair rotates. Imo this looks better and has a coolness effect so i'm keeping this for now
- Fix shadow issue in some cases where the stereo-shift wasnt considered 
- Fix VR cropping with fullscreen theater mode - Fix incorrect mouse confine when changing resolutions due to renderer vars not yet updated which the hw mouse was querying 
- Renamed IsStereoModeEnabled -> IsVREnabled to make it more clear that this also means the TheaterMode can be active
- Maintain resolutions across all VR modes when turning off/on any mode (i.e. theater to non-vr, non-vr to theater etc) 
- Enable stereostrength scaling in editor without gamemode if strength is smaller than 1 
- Disabled broken r_ResolutionScale in VR 
- Disabled pl_proceduralRecoil.enableHeadRecoil in VR as it feels very unnatural and causes motion sickness
