# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
# New Mission: Defend Location - Ship Battles V3
Ship Battles V3 introduces the Defend Location archetype, a style of ship combat mission that has been a design goal since the original Ship Battles release. The premise is straightforward: a location is under attack and it is your job to stop it. Enemy bombers make coordinated strafing runs on fuel storage and other critical infrastructure, and your task is to intercept them before they can complete those runs. Let too many get through and the mission fails.

Alongside the core Defend mission, V3 also introduces a combined archetype that layers an escort objective on top of the defense. While you are shooting down bombers, a friendly ship is either launching from the station or inbound for landing, and hostile fighters are focusing on it. Both objectives are active at the same time. Completing both is required to succeed, and failing either ends the mission. This combined variant is the more demanding of the two and is designed to stress different ship classes, with interceptors and heavier fighters filling different parts of the engagement.

V3 also updates the existing Escort Ship archetype from V2 with Ace Pilot spawns and more varied escort ship flight paths, increasing the difficulty ceiling and reducing the predictability of those missions for players who have already run them extensively. Defend Location missions are available across asteroid mining bases in Stanton, Pyro, and Nyx at a wide range of difficulty tiers and are issued by Foxwell, Head Hunters, CFP, Rough and Ready, and several corporate and logistics organisations depending on location.

**Mission Details**
- Available at asteroid mining bases across Stanton, Pyro, and Nyx via Contract Manager

- Difficulty ranges from Very Easy through to Super tier (6 difficulty levels)
- Missions are rep-gated; Foxwell contracts additionally require completion of the Foxwell intro mission before becoming available
- Abandoned and personal cooldown time of 15 minutes per mission
**Rewards**

# New FPS Weapon: UltiFlex Crossbow
Implementing the base version long-awaited UltiFlex crossbow. Featuring a devastating, shattering bolt and harsh projectile drop, the UltiFlex Crossbow rewards skilled aim with immense power. Its near-silent firing mechanism lets you strike quietly and gain the upper hand on your foes.

The craftsman at UltiFlex went through hundreds of prototypes to discover the perfect lightweight material with the right combination of strength and flexibility for its Novia crossbow, an ideal companion on everything from frontier expeditions to tactical infiltrations. With a pull of its firing action, the Novia near-silently launches a heavy bolt that shatters on impact causing devastating damage to close-range targets. Players can currently use the new crossbow in Single Elimination AC matches as well as receiving the blueprint as a reward from completing TSG. (Currently just the base version of the crossbow is in the PTU)

**Crossbow Stats**
- Weight: Light
- No damage drop off
- Projectile Velocity: 185 (3/4x Slower than most FPS weapons)
- Aim down Sight Time: 0.18
- RPM: 42
- Mag size:  5
- Custom Sway Profile, 'Very sticky' allowing for flicks
- Audio: 35M perception radius (Weapons are 150m) and custom attenuation falloff. 
Damage: 
- 2 tap medium armour to the chest (PVP)
- 1 tap heavy helmets (PVP)

**Design Notes from Zac**
"Kept ya waitin huh? The long awaited crossbow is here featuring some very competitive stats such as it's fast aim time, amazing hipfire, high alpha damage and light weight build but with the downside of a visible tracer, limited ammo capacity, slow and heavy drop on the projectile.

Overall the weapon allows for high skill expression being a nimble, light weight devastating weapon in the right hands"
