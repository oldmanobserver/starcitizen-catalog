# Features & Gameplay
> **Core Tech**
**VR Technical Updates & Fixes**
Fixed an issue causing the new Inventory Interface windows to overlap each other and eliminate the actor card between them (STARC-196187)
Added new cvars r_StereoUIWidth/Height to control the UI resolution in VR
 > Default res is 2560x1440 for high crisp text and UI
 > All RTTs rendered after Post Processing use this size and UI Scaleform  
 > GetDisplayWidth/Height returns this res in VR 
Large refactor of display/render size values:  
 > Rename IDisplay::GetDisplayWidth() to GetOutputWidth()   
 > Rename display vars in the renderer to renderWidth/HeightAfterTSR 
 > Added new IRenderer::GetRenderWidthAfterTSR() function for RTTs and a few other uses cases as GetDisplayWidth() now returns the UI res in VR 
Render RTT After Post processing only once in VR 
Force PIS wheel in VR to be always centered on screen (will be rendered in world in the future) 
Some code may use the stereo cursor while its not being active. In this case we simply use the view cam pos and viewdir 
Removed r_StereoDebugDrawing as it doesn't give any benefit anymore now with proper UI rendering
