**Known Issues**

- Multi-System - PU - ASOP Terminal / UI - There is a chance that a blank information of the Vehicle may appear on Hangar Delivery Request using the ASOP Terminal
- PU - Nyx/Levski - Transit - Going prone whilst in a moving Limbo Elevator Carriage, will cause the player to fall out of the carriage

# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
Operation Breaker Stations Polish
Further LOD, performance, and lighting optimization. Removed ability to set and respawn at QV Breaker Stations medical beds. Fixed various holes around the exterior of the location.

**Inventory Redesign**
Further lighting and shadow visual polish. Updated support for mining gadgets and radars.

**Crafting**
Further fabricator and crafting audio inclusions.

> **Core Tech**
**VR Updates & Fixes**
Cursor wasn't working in a ship with mobiGlas in Vehicle view due to a filtered action. Rewrote the cursor again but this time moved everything into StereoFramework for easier maintenance. The cursor is now being controlled directly via mouse and no longer via actions. Won’t block any inputs when the vr cursor isn't active.
