# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Operation Rock Breaker Polish**
Further location performance, LOD, and lighting optimizations. Added kill volume inside Rock Cracker asteroid outside of mission opening. Increasing savrilium rock count within the asteroid. Further minimap markup.  Adjusted defend areas around the location to allow for the reinforcement enemies to use cover correctly.

**Crafting**
Fabricators moved to different shops (Kelto/Dumper's Depot - Currently missing from Levski). Cleaned up of some armor blueprints and correction of weapon recoil reductions to be even on energy and ballistics. Updated fabricator physics proxies. Added fabricator LODs. Tonight we are testing blueprint persistence between builds and are expecting blueprints gained in tonight's build to persist into the next PTU build.


> **Ships and Vehicles**
**Engineering Updates**
Large health increases for Doors, Ramps, and Elevator across all ships 

> **Core Tech**
**VR Updates**
- Fix Mirror Mode Smoothing which was smoothing the camera incorrectly and not the headsets hmd rotation
- Fix hardware mouse not returning same values when transforming from and to display space due to rounding errors
Completely rewrote VR Cursor:  VR Cursor no longer has any bounds and can be moved indefinitely. Cursor updated only once per frame with the position multiple times since view camera also gets updated multiple times. Hide VR cursor in personal inventory which V2 no longer needs . Add EVA yaw/pitch mouse actions to inMobiGlas_menu since they control the vr cursor. Removed EVA action-fails from PMA_Mobiglas which was stopping the cursor from being moved. Note: I'm not sure if this can have unintended sideeffects. Alternatively the vr cursor can be controlled directly via the mouse-movement events, but doing it this way its hooked through our normal action system and should work with any other controls directly as well
> **Ships & Vehicles**
- **Added purchasable ship radars to Omega Pro in New Babbage**
