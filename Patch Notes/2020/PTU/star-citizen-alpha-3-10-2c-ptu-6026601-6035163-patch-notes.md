**Testing Focus**
> Important: This build is to help test some infrastructure improvements to the backend loadout service. We would like players to do all forms of loadout changes with their character clothing and weapons, ship loadouts, and entering and exiting prison which updates a character loadout.

**Known Issues**
- When saving changes to arm armor in PMA, mobiGlas UI disappears (Pressing F1 to close and reopen mobiGlas to get it back)
- Global chat is unavailable in the visor HUD
- If the Player Unequips Armor/Weapons/Utilities and Saves Changes, whatever was Unequipped will no longer be available in the PMA until the PMA is re-opened
- The Elevator panel on the Carrack may fail to work on spawn.
- Private Arena Commander matches are temporarily disabled due to an issue with the updated group system
- Player character can clip through the external doors of certain outpost buildings and Aid shelter buildings' airlocks when entering
- When firing at AI ships they will appear to Desync and have high packet loss
- Ships can be displayed as 'unknown' after destruction and be available to spawn again, but will not appear on their specified landing pad.
- Crystals and large surface rock deposits don't settle properly after fracturing causing them to vibrate and shake
- Hammerhead atmo entry effects clipping through interior of the ship
- The Ship Hologram / 3D Model will take over 20 seconds to load the first time the Player views one in VMA or the Arena Commander Menus
- The Area18 nav marker will appear at the central plaza, not the spaceport.
- Legally landed ships may be impounded
- If the player exits to menu/disconnects/crashes during the prison load screen transition their load-out will not be changed
- When going into ADS and crouching / prone you will be unable to see through the optics scope on the Arrowhead or P6-LR
- Freelook does not always work properly in turrets
- Shots from remote turrets may appear desyned but still connect with the target.
