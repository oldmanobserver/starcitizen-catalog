# Star Citizen Patch 3.8.2b
Alpha Patch 3.8.2b has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.8.2-PTU.4511368.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU.

**NOTE:** The Carrack is not yet ready for testing.  The primary purpose of this patch is to test long term persistence, which represents a significant change to gameplay.

Database Persistence Wipe: YES
