**Known Issues**
> This callout will be tough. Any time an AI/Player ship that has its weapons destroyed, (Though not necessarily immediately after), can sometimes cause a server crash. Not super avoidable but try if you can. We're going to see how this behaves!
Players will want to avoid starting at Lorville or New Babbage due to ASOP terminal issues.
There is also a client crash in this build for any player who tractor beams a corpse. You may want to avoid this!
