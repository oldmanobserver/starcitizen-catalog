# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.24
Alpha Patch 3.24 has now been released onto the LIVE Environment!  Patch should now show: VERSION  3.24.0-LIVE.9296942.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

Items not saved to LTP Include:
- Hangar Decoration Customizations (Decorations will be returned to player's home location inventory)
- Medpens, Ammo, Ongoing Rentals and Refinery Jobs, and Character Customization (Make sure to Export your Custom Character)

# Known Issues & Information
For 3.24, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This behavior is not the intended outcome in the long term and will be changed in an upcoming refactor. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs.

- There are several known Vulkan Renderer related GPU crashes currently in the build. If you experience frequent crashes while playing and are on Vulkan, test swapping back to DirectX to see if these still occur.
- Currently, players can get stuck in beds when pressing 'F'. Pressing 'Y' instead should work around this issue while we work on a fix.
