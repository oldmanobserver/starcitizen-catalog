# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.1
Alpha Patch 3.23.1 has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.1-PTU.9173159.
It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Open PTU
Server Info: PTU Channel - US Servers Only
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000


# 
# Testing/Feedback Focus
3.23.1 is mostly Fleet Week related but includes some other fixes and updates that might not have made it in time for 3.23.0 LIVE. Expo halls will run with an accelerated timeframe shortly after this build is released.
Added additional logging to gain insight for bug: PU / AC - FPS Weapons - FPS weapons won't fire
-     Stability/Performance/Bug Fixing


# Known Issues & Information
For 3.23, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs. This is not the intended final outcome for missions and recovery and further changes are coming in a later release.
We are expecting ships purchased in game with aUEC right before 3.23.0 went live to come back with 3.23.1 when it goes LIVE.
