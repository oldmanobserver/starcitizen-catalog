# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0
Alpha Patch 4.0 has been released to Wave 1 testers!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.0.0-EPTU.9418963.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

Server Info: EPTU Channel - US/EU Servers
Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
Server Meshing: Enabled
Mesh Configuration: 2:2:380 (2 solar systems, 2 servers per system, 380 players total per mesh)
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

# Testing/Feedback Focus
There are many systems still being worked on to bring it up to meshing standard so things like missions may be a bit wonky still
- Stability & Bugfixes
- Server Meshing  2:2:380
- Pyro Star System and New Locations
- Jump Points

# Features & Gameplay

- Locations

**New Star System: Pyro**
Addition of the second Star System into the Star Citizen Universe.

Pyro Space Stations: Adding rundown rest stop stations to the Pyro system, which provide basic services such as repair, sustenance, and commerce.

Pyro I is the first planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Its thick, high-pressure atmosphere hides a strange landscape beset by powerful winds and lightning strikes. Under the clouds, there is an ecosystem of plants and animals that endure its extremely high temperatures, even during powerful stellar flares.

Pyro II - Monox: Monox (Pyro II) is the second planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Nicknamed "Monox" for the deadly carbon monoxide in its atmosphere, it has a temperate climate, and was seen as a viable candidate for terraforming shortly after its discovery. However, its proximity to the system's volatile sun made it dangerous for Human habitation, and the United Nations of Earth (UNE) refused to clear it for terraformation, instead allowing corporations to harvest its natural resources. Undeterred by the potential risk, outlaws eventually took up residence on the planet when the last corporations pulled out of Pyro in the 26th century.

Pyro III - Bloom: Bloom (Pyro III) is the third planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Cold but naturally habitable, it became the epicenter of mining endeavors in Pyro. Pyrotechnic Amalgamated and other corporations constructed multiple staging sites, employees barracks, and processing centers that were in use until the cost of their maintenance could no longer be offset by mining profits. Abandoned when the last active corporations in Pyro ceased operations there in the late 26th century, they were claimed by squatters, outlaws, and former miners who lacked the means to return to the United Empire of Earth.

Pyro V: Pyro V is the fourth planet from the sun of the Pyro system. It was given the classification of "Pyro V" when researchers came across strong evidence that its outermost moon once maintained a stable orbit around the system's star between Pyro III and Pyro V. When it was struck by an unknown celestial body, it was knocked into Pyro V's gravitational sphere of influence. Residents of and travelers through the Pyro system are known to harvest hydrogen from Pyro V's green and yellow atmosphere.

Pyro VI - Terminus:  Terminus (Pyro VI) is the outermost world of the Pyro system. Its nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is technically breathable, but contains high enough amounts of methane and carbon dioxide that it has a negative effect on one's health after extended exposure. Pyrotechnic Amalgamated placed their main hub of operations in orbit around Terminus, later abandoning the station when they left the system.


**Outposts: Colonialism**
Scattered around the planets and moons of Pyro, these small homesteads for AI consist of a central hub and a few optional internal and external modules. They provide the basic necessities to support a small group of people for an indefinite amount of time.

**New Location: Space Station Contested Zones**
Contested Zones are a location feature coming to Pyro's space stations, introducing FPS gameplay with various layouts tailored for this purpose. The zones will feature a progression system requiring tokens to unlock different zones, giving access to the loot inside. Collecting all of the tokens will allow a player to open the final door and claim the grand prize.

**New Location: Asteroid Bases**
Implementing new asteroid bases scattered across space in asteroid clusters, gas clouds, and other areas of Pyro. From exploration-type gameplay to mission-based locations, these bases include both constrained interiors for potential FPS conflicts as well as space combat while reaching or fleeing from the location.


- AI
**Full Universe AI Animation, Audio, and Loadout Overhaul**
Expanding AI social wild lines, facial animations, and more to bring further immersion to the persistent universe.


- Gameplay

**Jump Points**
Implementing the first jump point into the persistent universe, connecting the Stanton and Pyro systems together. Includes necessary vehicle items and functionality, the jump points themselves, and their inner tunnels.

Opening and Entering the Jump Point: To interact and use jump points, first, enter quantum navigation mode and fly to about 8 kilometers from the tunnel. This should link you with the jump point and give you some UI directions on what the jump system is currently doing and will allow you to begin aligning your ship with the point to start the tuning process. Once tuned, press and hold the Left Mouse Button to open the jump point. Once Open, fly towards the tunnel and you’ll be pulled down the tunnel spline automatically when close.

Navigating the Jump Tunnel: Traversing the jump tunnel between systems is a skill unto its own. Taking approximately 3 minutes from end to end for this initial Stanton/Pyro jump point, the player must maneuver their ship to avoid collision with the tunnel walls as well as other obstacles in the way or risk being ejected into open space, far away from their intended position. As the player progresses through the winding tunnels, their authority will transition from one solar system to the next with a gradual gradient of color change indicating they are getting closer to the exit on the other end.



- Core Tech

**Server Meshing V1**
The initial implementation of Server Meshing enables multiple servers per shard to improve load distribution and facilitates navigation between two solar systems. With this initial release tonight we are running with a "2:2:380" Configuration which means  2 Solar Systems, 2 servers per solar system, and 380 total players on the shard. This will increase throughout PTU phases as we test multiple configurations.

**Mission System Refactor (Ongoing)**
Reworking the underlying Mission System to become compatible with Server Meshing, allowing for easier creation and maintenance of mission content. Currently, not all missions and systems have been finished so a limited number of missions are available on PTU.
