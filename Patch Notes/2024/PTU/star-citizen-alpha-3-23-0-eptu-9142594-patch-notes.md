# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9142594.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Wave 1
Server Info: US/EU - EPTU Channel - PU/AC - Replication Layer Enabled/Recovery Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Testing/Feedback Focus**

**Known Issues**
For 3.23, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs.
Distribution Center missions sometimes show the wrong location markers inside so might be difficult to know exactly where you need to go to. 
Server and Client Performance is something we are constantly monitoring and working on fixes and changes for 3.23. Currently we are seeing quite a few issues that are reducing the experience and looking into these.

Core Tech
- Vulkan Renderer (Beta)
Vulkan Renderer has now been enabled in Star Citizen. This new renderer will be off by default but has been added to the Graphics settings menu. In this first release, the focus is on hardware/driver issues, stability, and any major performance issues. At this point we do not expect Vulkan to be outperforming D3D11 on the CPU usage due to the fact we haven't enabled multi-threading of the rendering submission yet, but do expect CPU performance to be within a 30% margin. Once we have multi-threading enabled we expect a significant net-gain. On the GPU side we should be closer to parity.

Performance improvements and stability improvements will be on-going throughout 3.23, with the aim to make Vulkan the default and more performant implementation in a following release. In the meantime we appreciate any and all feedback towards this.

Additionally, you may see a few new folders now in Star Citizen's appdata. These relate to our new Graphics Settings file (just includes the Graphics Renderer setting for now), Vulkan's Shader Cache, and Vulkan's Pipeline Cache. HDR will be available in the next build but for today's release, SDR will be the only option.
Please also update your Graphics Drivers to their latest versions as this can enable certain missing functionalities required for our Vulkan implementation to function correctly.

- Planetary Weather Performance Pass
Optimizations to default planetary ground storm effects, including removing settings that were forcing the lods to be non-deterministic. Updated Hurston wind to increase chances of non-wind durations.
- Adjusted Transit System's Safe Teleport Points in Orison's August Dunlow's Ext Transit so that the player lands on the space port platform when the server recovers from a crash
- Nvidia Shadowmap Memory Performance Optimizations
- Visarea Performance Optimizaitons
- Physics Thread Performance Optimizations
- Water Performance Pass
