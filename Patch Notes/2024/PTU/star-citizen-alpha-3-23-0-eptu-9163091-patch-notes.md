# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9163091.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Open PTU
Server Info: US/EU - EPTU Channel
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

**Testing/Feedback Focus**
-     Stability/Performance/Bug Fixing
-     New Features & Gameplay Updates
**Known Issues**
For 3.23.0 LIVE, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs. This is not the intended final outcome for missions and recovery and further changes are coming in a later release.

# Features and Gameplay
Core Tech
-     GPU Memory Usage, Performance & Upscaling
With today's build we have introduced multiple GPU memory savings, however there is currently a known issue where Star Citizen can over-allocate your GPU video memory (VRAM), which can sometimes lead to performance loss. This is particularly the case if you have a GPU with less VRAM (e.g. 4GB), run at higher resolutions or graphics settings, or are using Vulkan (currently DirectX-11 handles this over-allocation more gracefully).

We are working to remedy this, however for now if players suffer performance loss at high resolutions or on low VRAM GPUs they should check their VRAM usage to see if their card is maxed out (e.g. using Task Manager or your favourite GPU monitoring app) and considering lowering resolution, quality, or the water simulation settings from the graphics menu.

For a 4GB GPU, we recommend 1920x1080, Medium quality, and Very-Low water simulation, while running no other GPU intensive applications. Upscaling can also help reduce memory usage by about 10% at 1080p, or 25% at 2160p. Running at 2160p without upscaling requires an extra 2GB of VRAM, so should be reserved for cards with at least 6GB, ideally 8GB.

In a future release we plan to reduce memory usage, but to also change the graphics menu to limit the available settings based on your GPU’s available memory.

As an additional note, we have removed the prior builds restrictions on upscaling at lower resolutions now that the UI has been fixed to render at full resolution.
