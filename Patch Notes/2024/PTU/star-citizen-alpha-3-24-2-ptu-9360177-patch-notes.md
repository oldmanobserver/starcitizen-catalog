Weapons and Items

**Rifles**
- Rifles have had their horizontal recoil toned down to make them far more consistent at distances contesting SMGs.
There's a large bias towards people loving the S71 with it's much more relaxed recoil profile so tuning the rifles horizontal recoil down will make them more consistent across ranges.

P4AR
- Reduced visual recoil 
- Reduced Horizontal aim recoil per shot from 0.07 to 0.02
Karna
It's had a damage increase to become more of the high skill, high damage weapon you'd expect where it depends on hitting initial shots far more
The alt fire mode fire rate adjustments are to make less 'deadtime' in the weapon
- Magazine size increased from 30 to 35
- Increased the fire rate of alt fire from 60 to 350
- Damage increased from 16 to 17.5
- Karna Weight adjusted from 6.9 to 4.20
- Karna Magazine weight adjusted from 1.62 to 0.60 (Karna weight was a heavy outlier compared to other ARs)
- Adjusted Karna Recoil to start consistently then get more inconsistent as it fires, this is done to help it fit into that more 'AK' category we have carved out for it.
- Minor adjustments to visual recoil to improve visual fidelity`


**SMGS**
Aim return time is how long it takes for the weapon after firing to return to it's default position
SMGs were snapping really hard on this so for visual fidelity the return times have been increased
Keep in mind the stated return time is not actually how long it takes, it's got a longer duration then stated because it has extra settle / bounce time

C54
- Smoothed out return aim recoil
- Increased maximum aim return time from 0.75 to 1.1
Custodian
- Adjusted min / max return time and curves to be in line with other SMGs 
- Damage increased from 11.1 to 11.11
P8SC
- Smoothed out return recoil
**Snipers**
The following sniper adjustments are intended to make 1HK to a non-heavy target viable at longer distances as the old values were too punishing and not allowing the sniper fantasy to be possible
- Smoothed in sniper aim down sight procedural animation
P6-LR 
- increased distance before damage fall off from 200M to 550M
Scapel
- Increased distance before damage fall off from 150M to 335M
