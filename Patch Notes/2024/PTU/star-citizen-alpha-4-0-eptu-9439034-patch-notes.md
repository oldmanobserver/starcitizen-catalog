Alpha Patch 4.0 has been released to Wave 1 testers!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.0.0-EPTU.9439034.

Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

Server Meshing: Enabled
Mesh Configuration: 2:2:380 (2 solar systems, 2 servers per system, 380 players total per mesh)

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
