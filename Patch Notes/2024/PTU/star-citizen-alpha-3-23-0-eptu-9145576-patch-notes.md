# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9145576.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Wave 2
Server Info: US/EU Servers - EPTU Channel - PU/AC
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Known Issues**
For 3.23, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs.
Distribution Center missions sometimes show the wrong location markers inside so might be difficult to know exactly where you need to go to. 
Server and Client Performance is something we are constantly monitoring and working on fixes and changes for 3.23. Currently we are seeing quite a few issues that are reducing the experience and looking into these.
-     AC - Backend / Network - Searching for a Match will always load a new instance despite other matches waiting for players
Please Avoid Multiplayer Arena Commander for this build as it will not matchmake you with other players. Single Player AC will work.

# Features and Gameplay
Locations

AI
-     Improved the AI usable fallback to avoid AI using objects incorrectly (standing on boxes, chairs, benches, etc.)
Gameplay
-     IFCS - Gravity Compensation & Automatic Precision Mode
A couple of safety functions have been added to IFCS to keep players safe. Currently there are no UI indications for their states as they will be part of the new MFDs which will ship after 3.23. However we added keybinds so you can still enable / disable them:
1.     Gravity compensation is now enabled by default in coupled and decoupled modes in areas with gravity, independent whether the landing gear is in or out. You will find the keybinds under Flight - Movement at the bottom of the list. They are labelled as Gravity Compensation.
1.     Automatic Precision Mode enforces a maximum speed limit of 20 to 30 m/s when your landing gear is out or extending (later we will extend that to flying within hangars, etc.). You will find the keybinds under Flight - Movement at the bottom of the list. They are labelled as Automatic Precision Mode. 
-     Weapon Regen Pool: Increasing regeneration output by 25%, meaning weapons will regenerate ammo quicker
-     Removed the crosshair from the Ship Magnification setting
-     mobiGlas home page: Performance Update: Main Page will now only list ships that have had their initial spawn location set
-     Updated Contracts Page to match visual style of the rest of the mobiglas and fixed missing icons
