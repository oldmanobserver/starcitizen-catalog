# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.24.3
Alpha Patch 3.24.3 has been released to the PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.24.3-PTU.9390680.

Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

# Features & Gameplay
Core Tech
- Graphics Settings Updates
Borderless mode has now been renamed to Fullscreen. Selected resolutions in this mode causes the game to render in this resolution but the window always stays fullscreen. This now works with DSR (higher resolutions) as well as lower resolutions and can be combined with temporal upscaling. Some things like the console and UI will always be rendered in the native fullscreen resolution.
DLSS minimum resolution has been lowered from 1080p to 720p. Currently, picking a resolution with a different aspect ratio than the monitor can cause issues at the moment and will be fixed in later releases.


# Bug Fixes
- Fixed - PU - Stanton - MISC Hull C - Ship Components / Ships / Vehicles / Resource Network - The MISC Hull C's Quantum Drive and Jump Drive do not turn on with Nav Mode and Quantum Fuel is unavailable
- Fixed - PU - Interaction / ASOP / Server Recover - A Player interacts with an ASOP while a server error occurs can block this kiosk from being interacted with by another player
- Fixed - Front End - Core Tech - Graphics - Resolution / Upscaling / GPU / NVIDIA - While Vulkan is on, Enabling Nvidia DSR upscaling causes a bigger fullscreen window than the native monitor resolution
- Fixed - Motion Blur implementation is broken (STARC-134903)
- Fixed - PU/AC - Ship/Weapons - Hurston Dynamics Attrition series does not fire or cause damage (STARC-131900)
- Fixed - Multivehicle - AC Only - Vehicles / VMA - Remote turrets can be equipped to weapon slots that are not meant to be
- Fixed - Arena Commander - Ships / Scoreboard - Ejecting in an AC match doesnt count towards death count and doesnt give a score penalty

# Technical
- Fixed 3 Client Crashes
- Fixed 2 Server Crashes
- Made Several Server Side Physics Performance Optimizations
