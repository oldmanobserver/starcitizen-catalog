# Star Citizen Patch 3.22.1
Alpha Patch 3.22.1 has been released and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.22.1-EPTU.9063902.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
