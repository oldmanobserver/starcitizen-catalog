# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0
Alpha Patch 4.0 has been released to Wave 2 testers!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.0.0-EPTU.9455327.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

Audience: Wave 2
Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
Mesh Configuration: 4:6:500 (4 Servers in Stanton, 6 Servers in Pyro, 500 players total on the mesh)
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
