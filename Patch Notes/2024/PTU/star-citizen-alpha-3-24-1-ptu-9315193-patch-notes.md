# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.24.1
Alpha Patch 3.24.1 has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.24.1-PTU.9315193.

Audience: All Backers
Server Info: PTU Channel - US/EU
Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000
Starting  REC: 10,000,000

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

# Testing/Feedback Focus
-     Stability and Bugfixes
-     Argo ATLS (Available for Evo and Wave 1 testers to spawn)
The ATLS Suit spawns like a ship in hangars from the elevator and there are a few known issues to know about for the ATLS
-     Players cannot exit the ARGO ATLS using the PIT Menu ( [Y] to exit should still work)
-     Player ragdolls out of the ARGO ATLS when incapacitated and snaps back in to the ATLS while still downed
-     Players in the ARGO ATLS suit don't react to getting shot
-     Unable to log out in a vehicle containing the ATLS (Remove the ATLS from the ship to logout)
-     ARGO ATLS is sometimes unable to lift 16 or 32 SCU crates, causing them to scrape on the ground (Workaround is to hold RMB to shoot it up in the air, and catch it again with LMB)
-     When launching crates with RMB, first LMB input will not function (Players just need to double click to activate the tractor beam again)
- Tractor Beam placement can fail to ignore blocking geometry, causing unnatural collision on placement

# Features & Gameplay
Gameplay
-     Vehicle Terminal Scrollbar Will Now Stay in Position When Swapping Screens to Deliver and Claim

Ships and Vehicles
-     Argo Astronautics ATLS Suit (Currently Available for Evo and Wave 1 testers to spawn)
The ARGO ATLS is a powered suit that the player can mount / enter, designed to assist them in performing more heavy-duty cargo movement tasks.
The player can retrieve their ATLS via the Instanced Hangar ASOP Terminal. The suit cannot be retrieved via Spaceport ASOP terminals, or ground vehicle ASOP terminals.
The ATLS has its own bespoke tractor beam, that acts differently to the handheld GRIN Tractor beams, and the Tractor Beam found on vehicles.
Rather than picking an item up at the point where the beam hits its target, the beam will pull the tethered item towards the player, holding it above the ATLS, whilst the player moves the placement preview. Upon placing the preview, the item will then move to the placement location. The player can also reset the rotation of the preview by pressing < MMB >
