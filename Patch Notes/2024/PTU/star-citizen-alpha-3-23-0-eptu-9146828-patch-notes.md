# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9146828.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Wave 2
Server Info: US/EU - EPTU Channel - PU/AC 
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Disabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Known Issues**
For 3.23, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs.
Distribution Center missions sometimes show the wrong location markers inside so might be difficult to know exactly where you need to go to. 
Server and Client Performance is something we are constantly monitoring and working on fixes and changes for 3.23. Currently we are seeing quite a few issues that are reducing the experience and looking into these.
