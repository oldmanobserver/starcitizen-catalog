**Turret aiming and auto gimbal mode**
Turrets will now use a different variant of auto gimbals. While in AUTO mode (check the self status in the visor cast), the crosshair acts like in manual gimbal mode. Gunners have to put the crosshair on the target in order to initiate the auto gimbal process. The UI will let you know when a good firing solution has been achieved. AI controlled turrets also have less of a tendency to fire through their own hull. Fixed VJoy missing in turrets in ADS.
