# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9139742.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Wave 1
Server Info: US/EU Server Regions - EPTU Channel - PU/AC - Replication Layer Enabled/Recovery Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
