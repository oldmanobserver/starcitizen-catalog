The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.

The current build is under NDA (Talking about features and testing is allowed but no sharing of game video, screenshots, audio, files, or accounts outside of Evocati)

# Features and Gameplay

**Locations**
- Updated Water Polish Pass
We have completely reworked the wave simulation and rendering of all water in Star Citizen in addition to creating a new multi-scale region-based water surface simulation system. Oceans and Water Volumes are now affected by all physical objects as well as forces from thruster and ship wake. Caustics are fully reworked to be both faster and driven by the dynamic results of the new water simulation. Underwater fog has been reworked to resolve various rendering issues, and the appearance of water when intersecting the camera has been vastly improved. Updated water interactions to react to explosions. Fixed missing river UVs.

**AI**
-     New Fauna: Kopion
The Kopion is a 4 legged hound-like creature that resides in Savanas, snow, desert, and cave biomes. This creature is not hostile when alone and will retreat to the nearest Kopion if it exists.  Although afraid of humanoids when alone, the Kopion tends to roam in packs which will cause the pack to become hostile to creatures they encounter where they will use their sharp claws and teeth to do multiple melee attacks which include biting and pouncing at their target.
-     New Fauna: Marok
The Marok is a birdlike creature with a long beak and batlike wings is part of the BOID (Bird-Oid Objects) family with flocking behavior. They are not hostile to humanoids and their flocks will disperse when approached. The Marok are native to savanas, snow, desert, and cave biomes and come in multiple feature colors that suit their environments.
