-     Fixed an issue that was causing airlocks to open without requiring players to cycle them

# Technical
In this build we fixed an issue that was causing the client crash handler to hang for up to 30 minutes. The crash handler should now take no more than 60 seconds before allowing a submission. If possible please wait the full 60 seconds after a client crash to allow the crash handler to appear. This should help us be able to track down other hanging issues with the client that many players are experiencing.
-     Fixed 2 Client Crashes
-     Fixed 2 Server Crashes
-     Fixed 3 Main thread Deadlocks
