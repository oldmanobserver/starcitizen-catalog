Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Testing Focus**
-     General gameplay
-     Scorpius
-     Fleet Week Event Testing
**Fleet Week Updates**
Shortly after the build releases to the PTU tonight we will be running a Fleet Week Event playtest tonight with the Expo Halls (Rotating once per hour), Javelin Tour, and Bengal Flyby!
-     Bug fix - Javelin tour info should now be displayed at the correct aspect ratio on displays in Orison
-     Bug fix - Javelin Tour will not start unless a player is within close proximity to where the Javelin would spawn at Baijini Point and Port Tressler
-     Bug fix - The Javelin does not undock from the docking port at Orison
-     Bug fix - Any players in the 'Javelin Tour' Docking Port area will get teleported away from the Orison Spaceport when the Javelin undocks
-     Bug fix - Bengal and Escort Ships will collide with and clip into the Station upon returning back to the beginning of its spline after streaming the event location out/in

**Known Issues**
After reviewing data and feedback from players we have decided to keep the current Scorpius flight tuning for now
-     The Platinum Bay shops at the reststops will temporarily have the generic depot attract screen on them until the proper Platinum Bay attract screen is created
-     Orison - The AR Marker for the Players designated landing area only appears when the Player gets within a close proximity to the Spaceport
-     Ships can explode after players exit them
-     While docked to a Starfarer the Valkyrie will continuously tilt instead of remaining stationary
-     Damage to player health can become delayed and can trigger after the player has fully healed themselves
-     The Argo Raft's elevator controls cannot be interacted with from either inside deck
-     A ship's targeting pip may be missing or disappear for some players; they cannot be targeted when this happens
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment can sometimes go missing after being released from Klescher
-     Medical beacon will not complete mission/payment when player is brought back from incapacitation
-     Character animations are not playing when looking at them at a distance through scopes
-     Spawn closet doors do not open or remain open for friendly AI
-     Remove Claimjumpers - Mission does not progress after player has reached mission location
-     Hangar elevator's collision grid can push player through its path when called
