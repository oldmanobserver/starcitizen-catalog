**Testing Focus**
3.17 contains new streaming changes that we are testing on the PTU and players may experience infinite loading or very long load times along with possible missing assets in game such as elevators or ships not streaming in. We are updating and fixing these issues as we find them and each new build will hopefully address these more and more.
-     Ship Positional Desync Test
In 3.17.0 we have put in a networking update that should reduce ship to ship desync. We would like to know how well this update works and if there are any observable knock-ons. Relative to 3.16, you should feel as though the facing direction and position of other player ships are much more accurate and real time. We have created a feedback thread in spectrum so please let us know about any potential issues with this that could include ship jittering, rubberbanding, jittering, and other effects of that nature.

Due to recent improvements on desync we have uncovered hitreg bugs which we likely cannot resolve for 3.17. In the direction of the velocity vector the collision shape of a ship will be slightly in front of visual model (the exact offset is velocity dependent). There is currently no work-around so avoid hovering inside the velocity vector of another ship and lead your shots a bit more during combat.
