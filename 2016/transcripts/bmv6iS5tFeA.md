Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hey everyone and welcome
to Around the Verse, our regular in depth
look behind the scenes of Star Citizen.
I’m your host Sandi Gardiner and joining
me today is Technical Director, Sean Tracy.
Thanks for joining me Sean.
Sean Tracy (ST) Of course, happy to step in
while Chris is away visiting Foundry 42.
SG: Yes he is and this past week saw the Intergalactic
Aerospace Expo draw to a close.
It was great being able to show those clips
from Galactic Tour.
What started off a just a fun idea really
grew into something special thanks to the
team and their hard work.
ST: Yeah it was a really tight schedule, but
it was impressive to see what they were able
to keep tweaking as the week went on and on.
Even though it was one of our really older
facial rigs, they were able to polish it up
a bit more with each video that we released.
SG: Very cool, and the other big announcement
this week is that the 2.6 Alpha build has
officially gone out ot the Evocati, Yay!
[Jazz hands]
SG: Jazz hands.
ST: Yeah, In addition to testing Star Marine
and new ships like the Herald, the 85X and
the Caterpillar, they’re also going to be
helping test the web version of Spectrum.
There’s a lot of kinks to work out still,
but so far they’ve already done a lot to
help us find and tackle bugs.
SG: And we will keep on patching to the Evocati
until it's stable enough to roll out to the
PTU and then eventually live to you all.
To keep track of the latest updates, make
sure to check out the 2.6 production schedule
on the website.
ST: To find out more about some of the tech
going into 2.6, lets go now to the U.K. for
the Studio Update.
Studio Update
Mici Oliver (MO): Welcome back to the UK,
I’m Mici Oliver, QA Tester, here to give
you this week’s studio update.
Now over to Ali and Luke to talk about asteroids.
Alistair Brown (AB): Asteroids in our game
were previously all hand-placed, painstaking
for the designers and artists who positioned
them and obviously had a practical limit of
how many we could actually place by manual
process so with the new request from design
was so they could place hundreds or even millions
of asteroids so the new system was designed
and built to cope with any scale that we can
come up with.
So, each asteroid field, will only have- the
clan has a few basic properties of how that
asteroid field should look so what type of
asteroids it should be, what type of density,
what colour - some fairly basic information
and from that it is able to seed where every
single asteroid in the entire asteroid belt
will be from that small bit of information
and the benefit of that is that every client
doesn’t really need to communicate with
the server and they can on their own decide
what they need to render and what they need
to simulate per frame.
This is from our design document on how we
design the asteroids and how we want them
to work for the designers so we produce a
texture that has four different channels to
control the four different main properties
of the asteroid field - or the four properties
that they want to change per asteroid field.
So to achieve something like Saturn’s rings
like this we would have textures like this
where we would define the height of it.
The offset is a bit- the offset is like how-
if it was going to wiggle up and down - which
for Saturn’s rings are perfectly flat so
it is a flat colour.
Variation is to handle different colours,
different materials, made of different composites
of metals, whatever we might find and there
is density control away.
And if we go to another sample - this is from
Oblivion - and they have this destroyed moon
which is a bit like our broken moon example
- we might have something like this where
we have a lot more interesting variations
- we have a pattern in the height, it is going
to have some verticality in it from this offset,
it is going to have some variation and the
density has a nice feather off on it and it
should be really easy for the artists or the
designers to quickly go through and make asteroid
fields or changes to them which they then
have to spend an eternity coming up with.
Luke Pressley (LP): What I want to show you
today is how we’re going to use the new
asteroid tech in practice - first what I want
to do is show you how we used to have to create
asteroid fields because you’ll see this
new tech just makes it so much easier and
look so much better.
So this here as you probably recognize is
Yela, it’s the moon with the asteroid ring
about it that we put in our first iteration,
2.0.
This here is the current density that you’ll
see in 2.5.
That’s the old tech, turn that off, here
is the new.
As you can see, generating- the way it generates
that is we have say, about nine or ten asteroids
that are unique asteroid models in there and
it goes through and it makes them one at a
time, layers them on top of each other, as
you can see there.
The density, the depth, just the sheer amount
- as you can see these things are rotating
very subtly - obviously the point is very
subtle, but I can show you this to the extreme
just very quickly.
There you go - what’s going to happen for
smaller ones will rotate much faster than
the larger ones to the point where the largest
don’t rotate at all because we’ll be putting
bases on them, these kind of things.
For instance, in Yela there are these locations,
here, that are full of pirates - there is
gameplay involved, we’ve actually hand crafted
those things - what we’ve put around here
is an exclusion zone which prevents all the
other asteroids from spawning in there - the
dynamic asteroids.
So as you can see, all of this combined, we’re
going to end up with a really much more cinematic
asteroid experience - you can imagine flying
through here - it’s going to be really exciting
and we are finally getting the kind of density
and movement that we’ve been aiming for.
AB: There’s literally no limit on the scale
- we can have them millions and millions of
miles wide, the asteroid fields, and we can
have them moving as well and you’ll never
find the same pattern twice - every single
asteroid is positioned uniquely.
I think that’s quite exciting for the gameplay
that you literally - every single place you
go in this asteroid field will be unique.
MO: Thanks guys, this will give us richer,
more detailed environments and really help
the development process when designing new
systems.
Now over to Steve who will guide us through
the new camera options.
Steve Turberfield (ST): Last time around,
we did a bit of a brief overview of the camera
and what tools our community are going to
have to play with and today I’m just going
to go a bit more in-depth with that - show
you what exactly it is you’re going to be
able to play with and give you a bit of a
overview of how the spectator mode is going
to work as well.
Going forward in 2.6, all ships and vehicles
will have the default first person cameras
which you’re familiar with - we have the
third person flight, which we commonly call
a chase camera.
We have our orbit cam, which as the name suggests
allows you to orbit around the ship from different
angles, and then the passenger orbit so you
can basically focus in on your pilot and manipulate
the camera around him.
So just to give you a bit of a rundown of
how the controls work - we’ve decided to
build more upon what our players already know
with the little camera control that they’ve
had previously - so we’ve always keybound
everything to the F4 key so you just cycle
through the views by pressing F4 and they
just go in order - so we’ve built in that
by using F4 as what we call a modifier.
So basically in order to operate the camera,
you just hold down F4 and plus and minus will
change the lens size to a preset one - so
you can to an angle like that where it zooms
in close and flattens out the view or you
can pull right back and like I say it’s
changing your depth of field.
With all the camera features I’m about to
show you, we have a nice reset key - simply
because if you wanted to change things on
the fly or you’ve done something you’re
not happy with and you want to go back to
the start - you simply hold F4, press the
star key and that’ll reset exactly where
you were previously.
So that’s your lens sizes.
The other new control I want to show you is
the target offset and that basically just
allows you to move the position the camera’s
pointing at.
Rather than focusing bang on the centre of
the ship, if you want to look a bit to the
side, a bit above, a bit below you can do
that as well.
So just like before, hold F4 and to manipulate
the offset, use your arrow keys primarily.
So left arrow will move you left in the x-axis,
right in the x-axis, forward and back in y
is your up and down arrows and if I just reset
that I can just show you F4 page up, strafe
up, page down, will strafe down in the z-axis
as well.
So now if I change to the orbit camera which
I mentioned before, what we’ve basically
done is very, very similar to what our players
have had before but by pressing Z as a toggle,
it toggles on the orbit controls - this will
allow you to move around the ship - you can
still, in this mode, change your offsets and
lens sizes and then you can reset them at
the touch of a button.
All of the controls that are described before,
such as lens sizes changes and target offset
all that is included but we’ve also gone
the extra mile and added a few additional
features in here which we think our community
will make a rich use of.
So, just to give you a bit of an overview,
this is basically the screen that you see
when you die - and if you are anything like
me, this is going to happen regularly - so
when you are in a team deathmatch mode, when
you die, you’ll automatically start viewing
your teammates, so the camera will lock onto
those and you can cycle through any teammates
who are still alive during the game using
the mouse buttons.
From here, by default, the orbit controls
are unlocked - because you are not controlling
the player, we can get those ready straight
away so you can manipulate the orbit as they
are running around the level and it will track
the player as they go.
Probably what I think is the most exciting
thing for our community is we’ve also included
a freecam function - because our orbit controls
are live all the time in spectator mode, you
can use the Z key instead to detach the camera
from the player - this enables you to basically
move the camera wherever you want in the level.
In addition to this, you can make use of the
save/load system.
So if you are making cinematics, you can cut
to different cameras on the fly that you’ve
set up in advance.
So I can just give you an example of that
now - I like that shot now, I can save that
to slot one - so holding F4 and holding the
one key on the number pad.
I like this one as well - just getting all
the different angles that you can’t normally
reach while you are playing the game - so
a real high up angle there, save that.
And then in addition to this, we’ll do a
nice close-up on the player and then let’s
go ahead and change the lens size so we can
look quite close and see all that detail - I’ll
save that to slot three.
So, while the game is going on, you can literally
just change this on the fly - that camera
one that I saved is there, back to camera
three, over to camera two for that high angle
shot - the tools have been designed for not
just use in gameplay, so you will be able
to create new views and bespoke camera angles
for while you are actually playing the game
but we’ve also given this to people who
want to create their own content, their own
cinematics, their own screenshots and all
that manner of thing that people are doing
but we’re just giving them the tools to
make it easier and get better results at the
end of the day as well.
MO: That’s awesome Steve, that’s something
that really helped me in my character testing
and I can’t wait to see all the screenshots
and the videos that you guys post to show
off our beautiful game.
I’m a big fan of these updates because they
are going to make my job a lot easier and
that’s all for our studio update, so back
over to LA.
Back to the Studio
ST: Thanks Mici, that asteroid tech is really
going to help the designers a lot, when tech
like this comes online, it can drastically
reduce how long it takes to implement things
which will allow for new content to be added
faster in the future - I’m really excited
to see what the artists and designers will
come up with for players to explore.
SG: As cool as the asteroids were, I’m really
excited about the new camera system - our
community was already creating some amazing
videos and I can’t wait on them to get their
hands on these new tools.
Speaking of community, let’s go now to Tyler
for the latest.
Community Update w/Tyler Witkin
Hey everyone, Tyler Witkin, Community Manager
in the Austin Texas studio, here to bring
you this week’s community update.
The Intergalactic Aerospace Expo has concluded
and we hoped you enjoyed the Galactic Tour
videos as much as we did making them.
In other news, throughout the month of December
we’re going to be making the MISC Freelancer
flyable to all subscribers.
So if you’re a subscriber and you’ve been
wanting to fly the Freelancer, now is your
chance.
Now it’s time for this week’s MVP award.
A huge congratulations to the Noobifer for
his detailed efforts in creating a video called
“The Birth of a Starship”.
Now this video outlines the ship development
pipeline here at CIG and has a lot of interesting
tidbits and I encourage you to check it out
for yourself over at our community hub.
Lastly, the week would not be complete without
Reverse the Verse, so make sure to tune in
live tomorrow at 8 AM Pacific Standard Time
at twitch.tv/cigcommunity where we’re going
to be talking about everything you saw on
today’s episode.
Thanks for all the support everyone and we’ll
see you in the ‘verse.
Back to studio
SG: Noobifer that was a really great walkthrough.
A really great explanation of all the massively
complex elements that go into building a ship.
ST: Yeah it was really solid, although to
be honest this week’s a little light on
weird gifs of me.
SG: Yeah we can maybe fix that, sorry Sean,
maybe they need fresh some material.
ST: Good call.
Make some extreme expression as fodder.
[Extreme facial expressions]
SG: For our next Behind the Scenes feature,
the audio team walks us through all the work
they’ve been doing to get Star Marine ready
to play.
13:50 Behind the Scenes: The Sound of Star
Marine
Ross Tregenza (RT): Overall Sam Hall, the
coder, and I we spent a lot of time, first
of all unifying the music across the game
because Star Citizen is so huge and there
are so many different aspects of it that we
were working very hard in these different
areas but it was all getting very compartmentalised.
We’ve managed to bring it back into this
one whole, global system.
And that’s given us a really nice foundation
for Star Marine now.
We have this great clarity.
We know how to build these systems and get
the best out of them.
While we have the music logic system for the
PU and for Squadron 42, for Star Marine the
conditions that you’re involved in and way
the game plays out is a little more set which
is a luxury we don’t have when you have
the more open world situation where people
could be doing anything anywhere.
So we’re able to be a little bit more authored
and bespoke in the flow of it which is nice.
So we … we obviously have the game rules
for the different Star Marine game modes and
that gives us the foundation we work from.
So we’ve got a nice cinematic flow that
we’ve built that picks up pace as the game
progresses.
Here we have six layers of music.
This is the main, sort of, bed of the music
during the game mode.
From the start of the match this is all actually
active but it will be completely quiet because
the two parameters that feed into this at
this point are both on zero.
The two parameters we have are control and
time limit.
So the first one is a parameter that feeds
into the main body of the music and as that
number rises up, as you get more and more
successful in the game, the music will slowly
start fading in and we use a lot of low-pass
high-pass filters, volume effects, etc., etc.,
so that these three stages of music are quite
subtle as they start edging in.
So I’ll take it up to about 25% … and
here it comes.
As you are playing game, you’re doing well,
you’ll start to hear this little gentle
bubbling of electronic music.
And if we take it up to just over 50% … you
can really hear it starting to pick up now.
And you’re about 50% successful at this
point, you start to feel the energy - it’s
getting exciting.
We take it up again.
See these three layers of music are starting
to build up now.
Take it up to here.
At this point it’s really starting to pick
up its pace.
And we can take that all the way up to 100%.
And now it’s big, full spectrum music.
You get a real sense of excitement.
What we really wanted to do was make sure
it wasn’t too … too jarring and too obviously
tied into … events in the game.
It is, but we want to make that a slow evolving
sound.
As opposed to “oh, you’ve done X, so now
Y has happened”.
That’s a really old, old style of game mechanic
that we avoiding.
So while information is being fed into the
music system it’s rising very slowly and
we have a lock on the speed it is allowed
to progress through its various stages.
So you don’t get this bam, bam, bam, bam
of increased steps of intensity.
You get this cinematic flow upwards that gets
more and more intense.
And there are two different elements at play
as well.
There’s the gameplay element that’s the
main factor of how the music progresses and
gets more dramatic.
But there’s also a time element that’s
independent from the other one.
And although it works as one piece of music,
the time element controls the percussion and
that will start coming in as time runs out
regardless of where we are in that overall
intensity layer.
Nicola Grelck (NG): So I’m Associate Producer
for the Audio team.
My role is to communicate with all the other
studios and with all the other producers all
over the world.
So in Germany and LA and Austin.
I have to make sure my team gets the right
information and right on time so we can actually
work on the highest priority first to make
sure everything is just good in the game and
has a proper sound and proper music and dialogue.
I’m really looking forward to see sound
went into the game because it is … we have
so many features that are coming in from the
audio side as well.
We have the pressurising and depressurising
states and when you’re outside in a depressurised
area everything sounds muffled and you know
actually that you are outside.
And all sounds sound like this.
The other way round, when you are inside and
pressurised everything is … it’s just
normal but the people outside actually have
the muffled sound so you know there are some
people outside and not that loud.
We also have the Music Logic System which
is reacting to the state in the game where
you are.
So am I losing?
Am I winning?
Is it the beginning of the match?
Is it the end of the match?
So it’s well reactive and gives you a lot
of audio feedback of where you are.
And on top of that we have the dialog edits.
So we have the Announcer - which is a female
announcer I’m very proud of - because she’s
giving the rules of the game.
So she explains the game mode, she’s telling
you when the match started and when the match
ends - so she’s actually rules the game.
But additionally to that we have the Leaders
from the Marines side and the Outlaws side
that is a bit like the music logic system
so it gives you feedback depending on where
you are in the game so when you have to hack
more control points in the Control game mode
for example, it gives you the advice and tells
you that you have to do that.
I’m really looking forward to Star Marine.
Barney Oram (BO): When I was thinking about
creating the atmospheric sounds, one thing
that I thought about a lot was whether it
should be more subtle or more in your face
and very intense and dense.
Because obviously the focus is in on the first
person weaponry - the shooting and the action
and that kind of thing and the other players
- but I decided not to be too subtle with
the ambients and try to push more of a character
of the space into the mix of the audio.
So this is part of the engineering area of
Echo Eleven.
It’s quite an industrial, dark sounding
space.
There’s a lot of steam and rattles and groans
of metal contracting and stuff like that.
It’s quite ominous - it’s supposed to
be quite dense and quite heavy I think.
All of these little spots are placed audio
that are emitting a … one specific sound.
And … they all work together to build up
a sound of the level - a sound of the room
- in one area.
This is some pipey type things.
And you can hear … hopefully you can hear
the water and stuff like that moving through
the pipes and … there’s steam and things
that that emit from the floor and occasionally
you’ll get bursts of steam and air and stuff
like that, both like that in the audio and
visually.
There’s a little bit here that I’m quite
proud of.
It’s a vent that you can crawl through and
get into another area but I spent quite a
lot of time trying to make it sound very encased
and isolated and small.
So it’s got things like … it’s got the
same kind of metal rattles but with very tight
reverb on them so it feels like you’re really
in this tiny little crawling space.
Another thing we are looking at doing in this
first iteration of Star Marine is creating
sounds that react in their environment to
weaponry.
So if you’re in a particularly junky room
- and especially in some of the maps we’re
putting out for Star Marine soon - it’s
got a lot of bits and bobs and junk and stuff
like that.
So when you shoot your gun in this room it
will rattle and resonate.
And some of the big metal objects - like pipes
and stuff like that as well - if you get close
to them and shoot you’ll hear that resonance
- which is really cool and really … I think
it’s very engaging - it really immerses
you in the experience of being in that world.
Firing your guns and everything reacting around
it.
Back in the Studio
ST: The Dynamic Music System is another example
of a new tool that really let our creative
team shine.
To be able to have the game adjust the music
on the fly depending on what’s going on
is going to add a lot of dimension to the
game experience.
SG: We go now from gunfights to dogfights
for all the work that has gone into balancing
the ships for 2.6
Behind the Scenes: Flight Balance
John Crewe (JC): So, we're going to talk about
changes to the flight balance today.
I try to avoid saying flight model, ‘cause
the flight model fundamentally is still the
same as it was.
It's still the same, simulated system that
John Pritchett and Chris really want in there.
This is more iteration on how the values we
put in and get out have changed, that changed
the way you fly not, the fundamentals of flying.
We've had some feedback from the community
on what they've heard about the changes, what
some of the Evocati have tested.
We had some ideas that what we thought people
would like, what they wouldn't like, so we're
looking to do some more changes and the community
feedback just sort of solidified that.
So we're going to talk about what's changed
from a month ago when you were talking …
Andy Nicholson (AN): Yeah …
JC: ... last time on Around the Verse.
AN: The first, the first thing we were doing,
obviously everyone will know about, is the
SCM speed change.
Where we kind of halved those speeds from
what they were and try and increase the closeness
of combat.
Make it feel a bit more engaging in that sense.
And that was, that just had to be addressed
in some way.
And that I guess leads us to demonstrate how
cruise is no more, and how we've adapted afterburner
to, to fill that gap to reach those speeds.
Here we go.
[Shows in-game footage] This is me now using
afterburner.
And as you can see, I'm hitting cruise speeds
here, and I'm just holding the shift key to
get there.
Then when I release, the current plan is to,
once you afterburner you will stay at the
velocity you've hit once you release the key,
and you'll stay in what we're terming like
an afterburner active or afterburner primed
mode.
Where you will continue at this velocity your
afterburner or hydrogen fuel will start creeping
down slowly, but you've used a lot of it to
burn up to this velocity in the first place
and gone out of bounds.
JC: Once we have reduced the SCM speeds the
afterburn speeds get ... push you back up
there, but the fuel consumption has had a
complete overhaul, so you can maintain those
faster speeds for longer.
AN: You'll be able to maintain it at that,
at that velocity and use less fuel pretty
much as we show here, but there will be a
higher burn cost for getting up to that velocity
from a point after that will be the penalty
of using afterburner quickly.
You have to wait a little bit, but if you're
using it to get over great distances you're
burning it fast, but then truck on as you
are consuming very little.
But it's, it's those moments where you have
to quickly engage it in a combat situation
that might cost you in terms of fuel use.
If people are familiar with how boost works,
it's essentially shortening acceleration times
on all of your directional vectors, so that
you can maneuver a lot faster and that's what
boost has been used to.
If you're sliding off course you hit the boost
key, and you get back on course much quick
than you would, but then at the cost of the
fuel, so you'll use a penalty to that.
Once you trigger the afterburner you become
a lot less maneuverable much like you do in
cruise as I'm demonstrating here.
[Shows in-game footage] This is me at full
afterburn.
I've got the restricted maneuvering.
This is entirely based on where your throttle
is once you enter the mode.
So, the lower the throttle is the more maneuverable
you are whilst afterburning.
Suppose you try to change your course quickly.
You decouple.
You spin round.
You hit afterburner to get those main engines
to change direction as quickly as possible,
as you can see by that.
If you want to afterburner into six you just
press shift and hold it, and that's … that's
all you need to do.
It's no tap and hold anymore.
JC: It's the same key that it was …
AN: Yeah …
JC: … on other input devices like pad, HOTAS
…
AN: … We've just, we've just moved boost
away ...
JC: Yeah.
AN: … from that key.
Yeah so, so boost now being on X; it means
you can... afterburner and boost at the same
time, which opens up another level of complexity
to the game-play.
JC: Using the phrase turbo like we did before,
it overpowers, over-thrusts all your secondary
thrusters.
I think is the correct term for it.
AN: Yeah.
JC: So that's all your maneuvering thrusters,
your retro-thrusters, not your main thrusters.
So, it gives you increased thrust output to
all of those ones.
So, when you're boosting you can arrest your
slides quicker.
You can stop quicker.
So, you can combine that now with afterburner
to do a bit of both or use it independently.
So, afterburn in.
Let go of the afterburner.
Hit boost.
Do a tight turn.
Something that's going to be really useful
for racing.
So, racing.
Everyone was super worried that SCM speeds
were cut in half.
They thought it was going to be super slow,
and it's not, because you've got all these
new ways of boosting.
So for example as Andy tries to fly, whilst
I'm talking him through it, you can use the
afterburn down the straighter sections, and
obviously you can modulate that with your
throttle to sort of decide how much afterburn
speed you want.
He can absolutely bomber down the straights
and then back off, hit boost, put all of the
power into his maneuvering and retro-thrusters
to do tight turns.
We’ve been doing a lot of testing in this
with QA and the designers here, and we're
getting pretty, pretty good times with, by
no means fantastic races, but we're …
AN: [laughs]
JC: We’re getting some pretty comparative
times too, some of the fastest ever ones that
have been set on the leaderboards.
I’m sure that in the hands of the backers
we’re going to have some pretty good new
records.
AN: This really creates this balance of afterburn
and boost at the same time.
You’re switching between one, the other,
or both at the same time, try and get the
fastest laps.
When it comes to a straight line I’m afterburning,
I’m trying line my ship up as straight as
possible, hit the afterburner for the main
engine boost, and speed increase.
We’re gonna see it restricts your maneuverability
as well while your afterburning at full throttle,
so you have to be careful of that.
JC: That’s another thing that’s changed,
a lot of racing at the moment is simply throttle
to 100% and away you go.
With this, actually managing your throttle
can give some quite big improvements to it.
The M50 handles quite differently to the 350R
and not just a case of linear acceleration
or turning speed now.
A lot of the ships have favorable axies so
they can turn better when they’re angled
one way versus another.
How you do really fast lap in the m50 is not
going to be how do that fast lap in a 350R.
You’re going to have to learn how your ship
works, what’s the strongest axis of thrust
on your ships, and customise that.
AN: I think it’s a lot of fun now with these
changes, especially when you hit the afterburn,
it locks you into a straight line in the wall.
Good fun.
JC: It also changes dogfighting as well.
Those SCM speeds have brought in the combat
massively.
Another thing we haven’t really talked about
is all the weapons have had a complete rebalance
as well.
We’ve gone and actually ground up, across
the board, all the ships have had their turning
changed, all the weapons have had their tuning
changed, the shields have had their tuning
changed, the health points, the ships have
had their values changed.
It’s really not a clean slate because we’ve
had for a lot of the ships we knew where we
want them to be and they were getting there,
but it was sort of piecemeal.
Every now and then we’d tweak one and we’re
like “Oh, that’s fine”, but it was out
of whack with the others.
Now they’ve all had same parts together
so it’s more comparative of the game as
a whole where everything’s gonna sit.
We’ll talk a bit how these changes affect
combat.
We’re in Dying Star in Vanduul Swarm now
in a Sabre Comet, so Andy’s using the new
Afterburn to really close the distance quickly.
Bit too quickly.
Ah, he’s done it.
Then you use presumably the boost there to
stop yourself.
Get right on the tail of this Scythe.
And then hopefully do some damage.
As you can see everything sort of much closer,
in your face, looks much more dramatic than
it was or is in 2.5 where everything always
stay far away, everyone’s flying really
fast and that’s one of the things we really
wanted to tackle with this to get combat in
close, in your face.
AN: You still got the advanced skill of a
pilot can use afterburner to their advantage.
They still have it, as much as fuel as they’ve
got.
They use it to their advantage.
It’s still combat at high speed, if they’re
good enough to do it around tight spaces and
around these asteroid belts for example.
JC: Those who want to push themselves, those
who want to push themselves with advanced
tactics, skills, and mechanics can still do
that and they’ve got new challenges to learn.
We’ve also got the missile camera as well
which is in there.
AN: Oh yeah, let’s do that.
Alright.
We’ve got a victim.
Goal.
JC: Works-
AN: Still going now.
JC: Yes.
Still going.
Works really nicely with some of the bigger
torpedos.
That we have in the game, like on the Retaliator.
AN: Yeah.
JC: Seeing these torpedos go for ten kilometers
into something.
So, that’s the new flight model that we’re
working on.
Still lots of iterations to go.
Got a lot of some of the UI elements to help
improve there.
Hopefully that clears up some concerns that
people had.
Makes people happy.
That’s all from us!
AN: Thanks.
JC: Bye.
Outro
SG: Missile cams are pretty cool.
ST: Yeah
SG: It’s a great way to see explosions up
close and who doesn’t like explosions.
ST: I know there’s been some concern with
Cruise Mode going away, but I think once backers
get a chance to test the new adjustments for
themselves, they’ll see that all of these
changes, we’re giving them a lot more options.
With the weapon and component balancing along
with afterburn and boost working in conjunction,
it can provide players with a lot more flexibility
while flying and finding.
SG: Very cool, and I wonder what the new race
lap time will be.
ST: Yeah it’s probably going to be way better
than something I can do, but of course it’s
not only about the new times, now that there’s
going to be all those new ships to try out
too.
SG: True, we will have to see how the Herald
and the 85X do against the old favourites,
but speaking of crossing the finish line.
ST: That’s all we have for todays show.
We’d like to thank our subscribers who help
us produce extra content like this and Bugsmashers
and Loremaker’s and all our Behind the Scenes
shows.
SG: Yes we do and a special thanks to all
of our backers new and old who have made Star
Citizen possible and we could not do this
without all of your support.
ST: To find out more about some of the features
we highlighted, tune in tomorrow at 8:00am
Pacific time, oh…
SG: For Reverse the Verse with Nick Elms in
the U.K.
ST: in the U.K.
Thanks Sandi.
SG: And until then, we will see you.
ST/SG: Around the Verse.
ST: Oh you do this?
Around the Verse
[Waves his hand]
SG: The other way.
ST: Around the Verse
SG: It’s okay, we’re all good.
