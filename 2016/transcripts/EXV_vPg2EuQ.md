hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers uh
I guess I have to finally smash bug I've
been busy catching Pokemon and the good
old asteroid builds of
yellow but that's all done time to play
some Pokemon oh fine we'll do a bug
after this just one more okay two more
hold on I got to go get one I got to
right bug
[Music]
species hey everyone we are here in
fancy Dan test level with all my debug
textures oh no up and I fell off so what
we have here is with our um lovely
programming art for the interaction
system yes this is totally programming
art um so if I get back into
my
ship with all the fun inner thought
systems we have a situation where if
we're normally in the cockpit we could
use a bunch of these interactions which
is pretty cool
however when I put this ship in Flight
ready and I begin to fly around and you
can see the Shadows move so that
indicates that I'm flying around um
working on getting the HUD fixed in
you'll notice that when I look at any of
the interaction points uh it's they're
not working I can't actually use
anything and this is a fun little frame
behind bug um what's happening is every
frame um we're shooting out a ray and
we're trying to capture what we're
hitting in the the vehicle um our
interaction system uses actual physical
location ation so you shoot a ray you
hit the physics and you go is there an
interaction point on this yes display
all the interactions you could do open
close restart you name it uh but
unfortunately um our physics and our
game code kind of run independent of
each other in the way that physics is
doing its own thing um and the game code
does its own thing and once in a while
they get into sync however um when we do
this Ray Trace uh we are actually
queuing it up on the game side and then
dispatching it at a later time
fortunately the time when we dispatch
the ray is when uh physics and the
entity system are kind of in sync but
unfortunately um because the game side
caches all the information and you may
get that Ray a frame or 10 later um our
positions that we sent so if we go over
to here um uh might be wrong so say I'm
in the game code I'm doing something and
it's time to fire ARR all right I get
the player position get everything where
he's at uh send up some Ray properties
right here and I basically cue the ray
which is cool except this position is
behind as soon as um the queue decides
to hey go hey I'm going to fire this off
so I could do an array wait 5 minutes
it'll do it however the position is here
and my ship is way back there now so
what we're going to do is basically move
all this
code
so undo all things we're going to put it
into a new function and what this does
is when our deferred Ray Caster is about
to submit our Ray tracing information to
the um the physics system um that's when
we get our actual information and we
could abort out in case things went
wrong um so I want to do an array I tell
the um what do you call it the the Ray
Caster Hey whenever you're free let me
know when it goes hey it's your time to
shine uh give me all your information
and it sends it off now in theory this
would be
fine but then we have to deal with
another problem where again with the
physics system we we have the player and
the vehicle and they're two independent
things what that means is when the game
code snaps the player onto the seat of
the ship at this point in time they're
they're one uh you could think of them
being basically in the same area however
um when physics starts simulating the
player actually has no velocity or
anything cuz his position is getting set
to the seat but physics doesn't know
that so he stays behind but the ship has
velocity and acceleration so it
continues on so our poor player is stuck
here until um the game code comes along
and says you should be
here
uh kind of crappy but uh we have a
solution for this called the zones or
the grid system and ideally the ship
would have a grid and when we stick the
player in there when the ship moves the
player moves uh cool however not all of
our ships have a grid uh like our Legacy
ships like the Hornet or basically the
one-seater ships it's like do they need
a grid do they not need a grid the
bait's going back and forward maybe we
need a grid because we want particles to
fall down relative to you know you where
you were at um but at the same time it's
like is it worth the cost benefit so as
the debate goes on between whether or
not we install a grid we have to support
both systems so this bit of code Works
nicely if you're in a Zone relative to
the ship
so what we have to do
now it's kind of similar to the
projectile fixed a long time ago where
if the actor and the vehicle are not in
the same grid basically this snazzy
thing and the player is attached to a
seat uh basically this snazzy thing we
want to get we want to basically start
rebuilding all the information so we
know that the positions are off the
world positions are off or the Zone
positions but we know the local
Transformations are correct so we know
the player is going to snap to a seat
and the seat's going to snap to uh the
vehicle so what we could do is build all
of our local Transformations so this
first part is basically this the
distance between the seat and the player
and then the rest of this is basically
the seat to the vehicle or if the seats
on another item within an item we can
build the hierarchy once we have the
local position basically where the
player is is relative to the ship we
could ask physics what the vehicle's
current position and this will be the
actual player position if we multiply by
the local offset so we rebuild
everything get the real vehicle position
for where physics thinks it's at rebuild
it and now we know the player is here
and from that we know the player's eyes
relative to him so we can use that same
Matrix to basically rebuild our position
so that we're in the actual location and
with that set up I could hit
recode and
wait all right recode's done so now I'm
flying around let's get our shadows
moving so you can see the movement there
we go and when I look around if I let go
of the mouse I'm still able to look at
um the interaction point for the engines
off same thing for the power on on and
the open exterior so there you have it
uh fixing all the fun things you have to
deal with when you have multi-threaded
systems and independent ordering and all
this chaos hope you guys enjoyed until
next time we always have these fun
little things when riding games where
you know you have multiple systems and
they work different which ways you know
you have physics doing one thing the
game code doing another thing they're
working independently and then you have
to find ways to um you know find the
areas where they intersect so that you
could do the right calculation at the
right time then you also have updating
you know when you when can you update in
the game code pre post now later so you
just have to find the right set of
sequences so that if you're trying to do
an interaction in a ship you're making
sure that the player in the position is
exactly where the physics thinks it is
and where the game thinks it is so that
you could up with a little text box
saying hey open your canopy hope you
guys enjoyed um until next time
woo
