Hey everyone, welcome back to Bugsmashers:
whole new year, same old bugs, well, new bugs.
Ah, we’re actually still in the good old
new office, and can hear some construction,
don’t mind it, the show must go on, let's
get started *thumbs up*.
Hey everyone, welcome to our lovely lovely
test level as you can hear we have good ol’
construction noise going, so bare with us,
oh it stopped, and we had a little bug in
2.1.
Whereas you can see I can shoot no problem,
cool, but when I go over to my dedicated server,
I detach a few things as you can see all my
guns are gone, cool.
Now, I’m going to simulate repair so I’m
going to repair all of my guns, now I get
‘em back woo, oh no I can’t fire, nooo.
So, you get your wings blown off, your guns
shot up, you go to land on a repair bay, get
your guns back and now you can’t shoot ‘em:
why?!
So let's take a look to see what was happening.
Well, here in our lovely item code we have
this thing called shared item manager.
This guy’s job is to basically select a
port on the weapon, so in this case my Hornet
and this is my item port for the gun, this
authority basically says if whether or not
the pilot or the copilot or the guy in the
back, should be able to use this item.
And let's go over to, here we are, this is
our function that gets called when our items
get attached.
So let's detach all of our guns and simulate
a repair again, oh no the breakpoint didn’t
get hit- ah good old- let's try this again.
What’s happening.
Why..?
What is happening...
Oh...
I broke the vehicle.
Alright, coming back from that ... I put in
some debug code and forgot to reset it.
Alright, so we’re back here with our weapons,
can’t make it shoot, we detach it, woo goodbye.
Now, we’re going to repair everything and
when we get called on this shared item manager:
ah-ha!
We hit our breakpoint.
So now we’re adding that item back onto
the item port because we repaired it.
Let's see what happens, so we have an authority,
the authority is basically going to be some
logic that indicates if and who should be
using this thing, in this case it’s the
pilot.
So let's step into there in our current authority
we have an authority we are using, so we just
added this thing, we’ve been given the ok
that the pilot should be able to start using
this item.
So now that we have used it, we’re gonna
go say, “what should we do Mr. Authority
Manager?”
Since we are the server we are going to check
to see if our authority has changed and oh
no our authority is exactly the same, and
because our authority is exactly the same
it won’t refresh the state of the item,
so the item for all intents and purposes will
never get used, because the item manager thinks
it’s already in the valid state.
So, and that’s going to happen to all of
our lovely items, just going to kill the ship,
and we’re going to go back.
So what we need to do here is under some condition
we need to re-grant the authority, or refresh
the item state, and the authority will basically
call start-use.
Start-use is, “Hey item, I’m using you,
I’m the pilot.”
and then things like from the weapon will
be like “oh, you’re using me, so when
I press this button, listen to my attack,
and start shooting, cool.”
So we’re going to refresh it, by indicating
that we lost it and then gained it again.
So, we’ll lose it and then gain it, and
we need to do this only if we have a valid
authority, if we are using, and we have to
have an item on this port.
So we have an authority, we have item- oh,
give me my item!
And, that item has to point to an actual entity,
the p-item here is just information about
the actual entity item, it’s like an extra
bit of memory for our authority and we need
to make sure that our item is not used.
So when we hit this block of the code and
we have an actual authority piece and we have
an actual item, and the item use state is
not equal to the authority use state is then
we need to refresh that logic so that we can
actually start-use on that item.
Now this is good for the server, but we also
need to do this same bit of information on
the client and that’s where this bit of
code happens.
So the server will do that information, it
will tell the network to flush and send all
that information to the client.
Now the client will come here and they’re
going to have the same problem because for
all intents and purposes nothing has changed,
however we got a new item on there so we need
to refresh everything.
So we are going to, “should refresh base
on item.”
So we’re going to say that our authority
has changed, even though it hasn’t, so that
way we can get the same code setup where it
loses its authority and gains it again, so
that way we could refresh our state.
There we go, so if we have an authority and
have an item, and it’s not equal to our
current use state, we are going to refresh.
Alright, so let's give that guy a recode,
oh I love recode.
Sippin’ mah’ coffee’, and if this works
out I’ll get my seven quarterly portions.
[Tom Hennessy badgering him about his food
portions in the background]
I get- do you see this sticky?
It says seven- it says seven.
Seven.
I get seven quarter portions.
Alright, so we spawn, we can shoot, and we’ll
detatch everything.
Oh no, our guns are gone!
Now we’ll simulate repair.
Wam.
Now I can shoot again, haha!
So now, when you get your wing blown off,
your gun blown off, and be able to repair,
you can expect that gun to work again just
as it is.
This will actually fix another fun issue where
if for some reason we have to detach and reattach
during item sterilization.
So when you spawn in we have to do a lot of
weird stuff, um sometimes in your standard
playing where you initially spawn, you can’t
shoot or use your actual guns or items, this
was the cause of that.
So this sucker fixed two things, one when
you repair and add everything back you can
shoot again, and during the initial spawn
sometimes you guns wouldn’t work.
So two for one, I think that’s worth seven
shekels or quarterly portions.
Seven!
Alright.
(DiscoLando creeping behind the monitor while
they joke around regarding the noise levels.)
Alright, so hope you guys enjoyed this bug.
It was a little fun thing with our item authority,
you know when you detach and reattach it was
just like, “hey!
you’re in the same state!
I’m not going to reset you, everything’s
good,” but in reality it didn’t call start-use,
so you couldn’t actually use the guns, couldn’t
use the items.
So we fixed that bad boy up, and it fixes
your weapons when you repair and when you
initially spawn in, so everything’s good
to go.
Hope you guys enjoy and I hope you guys destroy
things, repair, and get your quarterly portions.
It’s worth seven.
