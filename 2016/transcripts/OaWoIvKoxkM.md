hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers I'm
your host Mark aent I'm a gameplay
programmer here at C Los Angeles and I'm
here to show you some bugs that we're
playing in the game let's take a look
box
bishes hey everyone we are here in good
old uh dying star and we have a bug
where if you turn off GS safety and you
go full speed you're supposed to black
out and play this you know animation
like well you passed out and then
sometime later you recover and you go
yeah I could start fighting again
however
um if
we make the guy try to pass out o that
was quick we're in an M50 um so in this
code I put some break points so when we
actually black out um we'll hit this
little call step so I know when it's
happening and let me remove this break
point we'll continue we're passing
out but look he's not passed out and I
can't I don't have control of the ship
now we
recover and I have sweet control and of
course I hit an asteroid luckily I have
god mode ooo let's stop the
ship going way too fast all right so
what's happening well Shenanigans that's
what's happening um in a long long time
ago um we introduced this little bit of
code where it we'll start playing a
blackout animation so you fall down and
then after the animation is done you
recover and
unfortunately um that code is
well still there and it expects that
after the animation's done you recover
however the animation and setup was
changed so that it'll play the animation
and then it will stay there until the
code
recovers however uh this bit of code
right here
actually Bas um any animations I get
done it will just be like Oh I'm done so
it gets you out of the animation even
though the game code still you has you
in the the blackout State um
unfortunately the way that mannequin
works is we have the ship and we have
the player and we ins slave the player's
animation system to the vehicles and we
play an animation on the vehicle which
plays also on the player now um this
functionality right here will actually
get called when the vehicle gets done
with the animation or if the player gets
done and since the vehicle doesn't have
any animations it's going to happen
instantly so that means as soon as you
play the blackout animation
it will cancel because this bit of code
here says hey you're done and then the
guy goes back to idling so we want to do
is add a bit of code that checks to see
if we're the main layer and if uh they
call it the scope or the layer that
we're on of the animation is the same as
the scope that we're on here so we're
making sure if we're playing animation
on the player we're getting the
animation when it's finished from the
player and not from the ve the vehicle
so let's hit the magic recode
Button as recode happens I want to show
you guys a little fun bug that we
discovered with the visual studio
apparently uh we have two structures
here um and they both have an inner
structure the only difference is that
one has a named and one has an anonymous
now when we run this it should set a to
66 7 to 776 seven on both of them
however when we run this we can see poor
Robin using the anonymous structure sets
it to some randomized value which is
horrendous because we use that same we
use that same setup here in the radar
data bank and it was causing all sorts
of fun crashes because of a compiler
issue the easy fix of course give it a
name yay bugs all right
back to the original bug uh we have
here uh so recod is just finished we put
in the new code let's give this a spin
oh we blacked
out and of course it's playing the
animation but we can't see it so let's
try that again we'll go in first person
this
time woo all right what's up we're
blacking
out hey we passed
out and then we'll
recover hey we oh we HD an asteroid now
since we've you know we've passed out
now we're recovering the animations are
done so then the game code can give you
back control of your ship and of course
I'm spinning wildly out of control
because during this time I had an
asteroid and just went haywire let's see
if I can get control of my ship
again nope looks like I'm going way too
fast but it's kind of cool well the
animation now plays hope you guys
enjoyed uh until next time so as you
guys saw we had a little issue where uh
you know you have you're flying around
your ship you do too much G's you're
supposed to pass out and recover but
what happened was it instantly recovered
and you're just like holding there you
couldn't move because the game code
still thought you were blacked out but
it look like you're okay uh fix the code
so now you'll play the
animation then you'll play back out and
then you'll get all the controls so the
blackout and recover works as expected
looks pretty good what do you guys think
all right well till next time Bug
