Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hey everybody, welcome
to another episode of Around the Verse where
we take a look at Star Citizen's development.
I’m Sandi Gardiner.
Forrest Stephan (FS): And I’m Forrest Stephan.
SG: To start things off, just wanted to welcome
all of newcomers to the game and if you’re
thinking of joining, now's the time.
This is the last week for the Super Hornet
free fly, and if you haven’t tried one yet
for yourself just click on the link at the
top of RSI to get further details on how to
start flying.
And behind the PU alpha and Arena Commander
content available to play right now, we have
a lot of other stuff in the pipe.
You want to update everybody on what’s happening?
FS: Oh I’d love to.
So we have Alpha 2.6 has been making some
great progress with new things dropping in
every single day.
The Evocati have been hammering away with
the new flight balancing so watch out, design
has been wrapping up a few new missions for
Crusader.
The music logic system is pretty much done.
The ship team have two new ships that are
feature complete and ready for release.
SG: Yeah!
Those two ships are the Herald and the Vanguard
Hoplite, they’re two pretty different ships
and they’re pretty cool and they’ll be
awesome additions to the game.
FS: Totally agree.
On the Arena Commander, art had been polishing
up some new item pickup system and the pirates
have been starting to really swarm about,
so be careful.
New cameras are in showing off new sweet camera
angles.
There’s just so much stuff.
SG: Cool.
We’ve also been doing a lot of internal
playtests on Star Marine with the whole team
and been getting great feedback.
The fronted network refactor and network improvement
are also expected to be wrapping up soon.
FS: Yeah and Mark as we know the “Bugsmasher”
found a pretty funny bug this week where we
could actually teleport through space, I think
it could be a feature but you know.
SG: Super cool.
You can check that out on our Star Citizen
Youtube channel.
So now let's head over to our Frankfurt office
for a studio update to look past 2.6 into
3.0.
FS: That’s correct.
Studio Update
Brian Chambers (BC): Thanks guys.
I’m Brian Chambers, Development Directory
from Foundry 42 Frankfurt.
The road leading up to CitizenCon: it was
incredibly busy.
It’s always cool to show off our progress
and get that out in front of you guys.
And the support’s been overwhelming for
myself and the team.
Team’s back at it - across all disciplines
- everybody’s busy working.
For this week’s update let’s start with
QA where Melissa will give you some insight
into how the QA department functions here
in Frankfurt.
Melissa Estrada (ME): The Frankfurt QA team
is currently made up of three testers with
two dedicated to testing the engine, and one
dedicated to testing Squadron 42 and FPS.
We work closely with the development team
whether we’re testing new code changes or
investigating an existing issue.
There are an array of different types of testing
we do on a daily basis but test requests are
high up on our list or our tasks that we do
pretty regularly.
So a test request is essentially a request
submitted by a developer who would like to
submit code changes that could potentially
break the build.
In order to prevent this the code will go
through thorough testing where sometimes the
entire game, or only certain parts of the
game, will need to be tested.
In this particular test one of our engineers
has made shadow and object optimisation code
changes.
He provided us with a custom Bin64 which contained
his changes and during our testing we discovered
a one of crash and excessive shadow flickering
throughout Homestead.
We then compared our finding to the vanilla
code version of the client and reported our
final results to the developer.
This process prevents new issues being introduced
into a build.
However the challenge we sometimes face is
if there were any recent code changes to the
same system the test request is meant to to
address, and then these changes were then
picked up when the developers synced to the
latest code in Perforce to compile the Bin64,
it then becomes difficult to tell which code
is causing the issues.
Regardless all issues are reported, further
investigated, and fixed prior to submission.
And the final result is a build that contains
improved shadows, no flickering, and no crashes.
And this is what I like about being QA here
in the Frankfurt office.
Being able to track down these issues and
contribute to the process of fixing them as
well together with the development team.
It’s a really rewarding experience and I
consider myself lucky to be on this team and
contribute to the development process.
BC: Thanks Melissa.
QA is always a huge part of development especially
with her and the team working with the Engine
team here.
I don’t always envy their job but they do
help us dig in and sort out any bugs that
accidently creep in.
For the next part of the update let's check
in with our Senior VFX Artist Caleb.
He’ll break down some of the VFX work they
did for Homestead.
Caleb Essex (CE): Today I’m going to give
you a more comprehensive breakdown of the
large sandstorm effect that was featured in
the Homestead demo.
This effect required a lot of collaboration
with the Audio and even the Cinematics department
to make it function properly within the engine.
So here we are inside the editor with the
Homestead level opened up.
The sandstorm effect itself is actually fairly
simple: it’s only made up of three different
sprites.
There’s a thinner sand texture at the top
of the effect, a thicker one down below and
the lighting texture.
The two sand textures also include normal
maps as well as the optical flow maps for
the frame blending.
These optical flow maps give us a virtually
unlimited frame rate for our textures.
Because of this we can slow down or speed
up the effect without the animation looking
choppy.
Something we actually do as the sandstorm
approaches the player to increase the sense
of foreboding and scale.
The forward motion of the effect is actually
controlled by Track View.
The blue line is the path that it follows.
As it approaches the player there’s also
a fog volume entity that moves up from the
ground.
This fog volume is to help with the transition
as the sandstorm hits the player.
However it is also used as an optimisation
technique.
When the player is inside the storm we can
disable the effect and enable a localised
effect of sand whipping past the camera.
By disabling the effect while it is hidden
in the fog we can sidestep some of the overdraw
issues that can arise when the whole screen
is filled with particles.
As we move forward all of these systems will
be unified and controlled by our Planetary
Weather system.
Here we have the final effect running inside
the engine.
BC: Thanks Caleb.
It always surprises me how much particles
and effects help in bringing the world alive.
It’s cool to see the progress.
The rest of the team - incredibly busy as
I mentioned - making great progress from cutscenes
for Squadron 42, to weapons, to design and
so on.
Another quick update is that the office expansion
that we’ve had: we’re now actively in
it - we’re now actively here and working
and functioning - and so I hope to show that
off soon.
So that wraps it up from Frankfurt.
Short and sweet.
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time.
Back In The Studio
SG: Wow, that sandstorm looks pretty epic.
It’s like something out of Fury Road.
FS: Aw yeah.
Mad Max.
Awesome.
Yeah I mean really now that all this art and
tech is coming online we are able to develop
some really interesting planetside gameplay
environments.
Right?
And even the environment wind can become as
much of a threat as possibly another player.
SG: There we go.
Speaking of other players, let’s now go
to this week’s Community Update with Tyler.
Community Update w/ Tyler Witkin
Tyler Witkin (TW): Hey everyone.
Tyler Witkin, Community Manager in the Austin,
Texas studio, here to bring you this week's
Community Update.
Now as previously mentioned, and just as a
reminder, this is the final week for the Fall
Free Fly.
So if you wanted a chance to fly the Anvil
Super Hornet, you can click the link at the
top of our website to find out more information.
Now speaking of free flies, racers get ready.
The Origin M50 will be made available to all
subscribers throughout the month of November.
Last weekend the Star Citizen community in
Germany came together to put on their own
community organized CitizenCon.
This event had almost 500 people in attendance.
You don't believe me?
Check this out.
Presenter: Greetings from Frankfurt.
Crowd of Community: Star Citizen!
Presenter[Speaks in German] Clean!
Now we are going to start.
Thank you very much.
TW: That's a whole lot of citizens and if
you didn't have the opportunity to watch it
live you can find out all the details of how
the event went over at citizencon.de And if
you are interested in these types of events
just a reminder to head over to BarCitizen.sc
Check out the interactive map, because it's
very likely there's an event in your area.
And now it's time for this week's MVPs.
Yes plural, because this time we don't have
one, but seven MVPs.
So I want to give a huge congratulations to
Sereth, Avalean, Valkyrie, FyreMaster, SnowCrash,
Cantrip and Michiel81 for their exemplary
efforts on the RSI HELPDESK.
Now for those of you who are not familiar
with what that is, this is a RSI chat channel
on our website where players can come together
to ask or answer questions about the game.
So congratulations again to all of you.
You're this week's MVPs.
Lastly the week would not be complete without
Reverse the Verse, so make sure to tune in
tomorrow at 7:00 AM Pacific Daylight Time
where we're going to talk about everything
you saw on today's episode.
Thanks again everyone for all your support,
and we'll see you in the verse.
Back to Studio
Sandi Gardiner (SG): Moving back to our Frankfurt
office, getting procedural planets working
is a massive undertaking.
One that we can't possibly show in a single
episode, so next up is the first of several
segments we'll be doing to focus on procedural
planet tech being developed in Frankfurt.
Forrest Stephan (FS): So on that note let's
take a look now on the ecosystem painting,
the zone system, and some other cool features
that Frankfurt has been working on for 3.0
and ...
FS & SG: … beyond.
Behind the Scenes: Procedural Planets
Hannes Appell(HA): So today we want to give
you the first out of probably many deep dives
into the core of what makes our planets tick
and about the planet creation and this is
tech developed here mainly in Frankfurt by
Marco, Sasha, Carson of course.
Basically with the Homestead demo for Citizen
Con, practical test case of what we call the
V2 planet tech which is... we are already
basically at V3 now so we kind of needed to
say at one point, that is it for the demo.
So we have a couple more features in progress
and the Homestead of course was not just made
because of our love of giant space worms but
also to have engineers and artists work on
something that is basically a substantial
test case so we can mature our tools, our
planet editor or what we call it the plan
ed.
To basically arrive at something where the
useability has grown into a mature tool set
but also the feature set of course with the
massive object distribution, vegetation, ecosystem,
painting and terrain height map.
Sasha: Working with our environment artist,
Pascal on the ecosystems themselves which
in the case of Homestead were actually only
five distinct ones.
HA: My job on Homestead was as visual director
and for that I basically initialized the lighting
and mood and overall feel of this and also
worked with our environment artist Pascal
on the ecosystems themselves and I basically
also every day a couple of hours spent with
Marco, Sasha and Carson on the tool set itself.
Marco Corbetta(MC): Hello, we are going to
talk about planets today.
Thanks to everyone on the Star Citizen subreddit
and the CIG community forums for your positive
feedback, we really appreciate it.
Initially we were not planning to have seamless
transition from space to planets into Star
Citizen.
Around September we started rewriting from
scratch the CryEngine terrain system, here
you can see my first experiment of a procedural
planet without any atmosphere at the end of
October 2015.
Then this is our first test with atmosphere
in November.
Carson Wentzel has been working on the atmospherics
and clouds as well as a number of other engine
features.
Here is our first public update at the end
of 2015 showing the first Delamar planet version,
it was more simple procedurally based but
was already integrated into the editor so
you could place landing zones on top of the
planet.
In February 2016, we had the first man working
on planet, at this stage we still did not
have ground details and we still had many
precision issues as you can see in the video.
So during March and April, we made a lot of
progress, you can see more details when zooming
into the planet and this is the video of the
first buggy driving on the planet surface.
At this stage the planets were mostly procedural
and even though we were getting good results
it was becoming difficult to really customize
the planets.
Pascal Muller(PM): There was no diversity
in the planets, it was either a big, rocky
planet or a jungle planet or a desert planet
but there was no variation in the ecosystems
on this planet and with V2, this changed.
We introduced something new, which we called
ecosystems, so when we talk about ecosystems
what we mean is basically you can think of
it as kind of a level of it’s own.
It’s a piece of terrain and it covers about
four or eight square kilometers, you could
say and each ecosystem contains many, many
different kinds of assets which are created
by the artists.
Part of it is the terrain itself, like the
information that defines how the terrain looks,
is it mountains or do we have dunes or do
we have plateaus or canyons and all this type
of stuff.
Then additionally to that of course you need
all the ground textures that make up the surface
of the terrain, do you have like rocky ground
or grassy ground and this type of stuff and
then on top of that of course you also need
assets…
all kinds of assets that need to be scattered
in a procedural way.
It’s going to be done by hand if you think
on a global scale, so all of these things
come into the ecosystem and for this Sasha
Hoba developed own editor for the engine and
within this editor we basically all this information
is accumulated and tweaked.
We tweak the height of the mountains, where
which texture belongs and which assets belong
together on which surface and all this type
of stuff comes together in the planet editor
in the engine.
Once all these ecosystems are done, you can
basically take your planets which is more
or less grey at the moment and just pick some
of these ecosystems and paint them over the
planet and this is basically how the terrain
is generated in the end.
Of course, when this is generated you want
to make sense of it, you know, you want to
have ridgeline of mountains and behind you
want to have some hills and that goes into
grassy lands or desert or whatever.
MC: So, at CitizenCon 2016 we were supporting
spherical terrain, seamless transition, run
time generation of 60 frames per second without
any preprocessing, unrestricted view distance
on a planetary scale plus different ecosystems
and the first version of procedural vegetation
as well as hardware tessellation and per pixel
displacement.
Going back in time a bit before Gamescom,
here is a test showing how Pascal had quickly
put together a Mars looking planet.
Using a few ecosystems and changing some parameters
like atmosphere, colours and so on.
So with a just few ecosystems and painting
them on the planet through the planet editor
we can create many different types of environments
and planets.
Here I’m showing a bit of our work-in-progress
features.
One of the next steps for us is improving
the procedural vegetation placement and object
distribution.
In this video clip you can see trees and grass
being rendered through the zone system which
Chris Bolte is going to talk about in a bit.
Here you can see in this last video another
work-in-progress feature: a rotating planet.
The planet is actually rotating extremely
fast but at this scale looks like it’s not
moving.
If you get very close on top of this static
control tower which is not moving, you can
see the planet rotating very fast.
Another interesting thing to note is the ocean
which was worked on by Anis, one of our new
hires in Frankfurt.
The ocean is reusing the planetary patches
with different displacement.
This way, we’re getting adaptive subdivision
computations for free and we don’t even
need any extra geometry memory usage for the
ocean.
PM: The original ocean was also just a flat
terrain piece more or less and of course for
the planet we also needed this to be a spherical
object and this feature made it in.
You can see that we have proper waves, there
is vertex animation, it’s nicely tesselated,
the shading is working.
Anis has really put a lot of work into it.
The next feature would be the clouds.
The clouds are still in a very early stage.
Carson Wentzel is putting a lot of work into
it, doing a lot of research, but you can already
see some realistic behaviour.
You can see they are casting shadows, there
are different thicknesses to them in certain
areas so there is less light penetrating.
Speaking of light, one thing that also changed
quite a bit is the sun.
Because this is a spherical object, you have
different kinds of lighting all over the planet.
So you cannot simply say, “Okay for this
planet I want to have daylight.
I want whatever is happening on the planet
to take place in sunset,” because, depending
on where you are on the planet you have different
lighting situations.
All of this is now implemented.
Depending where you are, the atmospherics
generate different effects.
At the sunset, obviously, everything turns
red and during daylight you have blue bounce
light from the sky and all this type of stuff.
Chris Bolte: Hello everyone, I would like
to talk to you about the changes related to
our core technology which allowed us to implement
the planets as you have seen them during CitizenCon.
One of the first components we changed was
the jobs system.
This system was responsible to distribute
work which must be done to compute a frame
in a video game over multiple CPUs.
This work is called jobs in our engine.
The old approach was applicable for perhaps
3000 to 5000 jobs per frame.
With the new one we can handle a very large
amount.
This was realized mainly by utilizing the
inherent parallelism of games which is basically
the smart way of saying that we have always
more than one object to update.
Furthermore, we changed the jobs system to
better communicate with the operating system
to allow for better usage of available resources.
We then built the zone system which is a better
object management system.
Such is a system is responsible to allow for
an efficient way to query objects based on
spatial properties, for example finding objects
visible inside the camera or overlapping with
a box.
This system replaced the octree-based scanning
approach and is now used to store all kinds
of objects’ world space position.
This system had two important characteristics.
Being efficient - the system should scale
well.
We already have over 200,000 renderable objects
present in Crusader.
This is realized by ensuring that we use efficient
data structures and use a processing layout
which is spread to multiple cores with the
help of the job system.
Then, the system should cope very efficiently
with large clusters of simultaneous moving
objects.
Here we use a novel approach of using multiple
reference frames.
The regular approach used in games is to store
objects in a single coordinate system, the
so-called world space.
This world space position is then sent to
the GPU as 32-bit coordinates and projected
to the screen with a projection matrix.
For Star Citizen, we cannot use this approach
due to two reasons.
The GPU can only process 32-bit floating point
positions efficiently but we need 64-bit positions
for the large game world.
We want to move kilometer-long spaceships
and planets through space.
In the old approach this would mean updating
the positions of all objects on said ships
or planets which is not possible in realtime.
So we did something else.
At the highest level, we organized our world
in a 64-bit position universe coordinate system.
To render the objects stored in that, we compute
a camera-relative position before we then
send the data to the GPU.
This allows us to keep the world as one coordinate
system by using the more efficient 32-bit
position on GPU.
To move objects around, we use multiple zones.
A zone is it’s own coordinate system with
all objects which move together like a spaceship
or a planet.
With this system we can move an arbitrarily
large number objects by just moving around
the pivot of the coordinate system.
Calling in such a system is implemented by
converting the tested against objects into
the zone space.
This sums up the technologies we had to advance
for our goal of a living universe.
Thank you.
Outro
SG: That’ll about do it for this week's
episode.
Remember to tune in for Reverse the Verse
tomorrow at 7AM Pacific or 3PM GMT.
We’ll be back with the team in Germany to
discuss Procedural planets and more.
FS: Awesome and we’d also like to thank
subscribers.
We wouldn’t be able to show you this cool
stuff like the procedural tech and produce
all these awesome shows without your continued
support so it’s so much appreciated.
SG: it is and until next week, we will see
you..
[Both] Around
the Verse.
