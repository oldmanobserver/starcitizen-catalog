hey everyone welcome back to bug
Smashers before we
begin got a little joke for you guys no
one's in the office so this is going to
be good you ready here we go what type
of computer
sings you got
it ready for it a Dell ah ah
bug
[Music]
species hey everyone we are in a fun
little map where there's nothing in
there but our evil
player and as you can see he looks
really really really
lovely um this bug happens to be um from
Oli and the UK where our good old
characters are not
streaming um in the higher end content
or I should say his lods his higher end
lods um whenever you're close up it it
keeps using the low-end lad which is the
lowest lowest lowest mesh um you could
have on the character this is what
you're supposed to see when the GU is
we way let me turn this this guy off way
back here but instead when we go way up
close we're getting the crappy log all
right so what's happening let's go to
the fun little
code um here we are so we're in uh this
thing or this bit of code called the
character instance this is
basically the where I got to go this is
basically the root character you see
here could probably just do this so my
root character uh the player has some
bones on it and then we attach the
helmet we attach the body armor we
attach his pants and his belt and if you
had a weapon you attach his weapon and
the character or the player and all his
bones has a bunch of attachments the
helmet armor and so forth and we
basically in this little bit of code
we'll stream in the the geometry and
hopes that the higher end stuff comes in
uh the only problem is this streaming
thing only works
for um well in this case it's only
trying to get uh raw geometry like even
another character which could have even
more bones or just pure geometry uh pure
geometry is a stat object and then the
character instance is another character
so you could have a uh you know maybe
another armor that has another bone that
you could stick something to um but
unfortunately we have other attachments
that add these things called skin
attachment when it just basically adds
additional bones and additional geometry
to the character himself so it's not an
additional um like this helmet if I put
it on it has maybe two extra bones here
but it's a separate object that I'm just
attaching to my head it's following a
skin object would be this thing getting
stuck to my head and forever being a
part of me it's not separate it is me
now um that's what a skinned object is
unfortunately those are the things that
look like they're breaking um so what
Ali did is he moved this little bit
BL uh so that it could
find per type and unfortunately um we
have different ways that we could have
skin objects um for our attachment we
have attachment objects and the
attachment controls how these objects
get um put onto the thing so we have an
attachment type bone then it will handle
any attachment objects that go to the
specific bone if we have an attachment
face it handles any attachment skins
that get stuck onto the face and so on
um now unfortunately the attachment
system has two ways of doing skins the
attachment object could be an item or
which has um another skin to put onto
the player it could be like the face
where the attachment object object has a
skin so the skin unfortunately could be
in two places right now could be on the
attachment or the attachment object and
this bit of code only
handles um the attachment object so we
actually have
to let's check to see if our
attachment also has a skin cuz if it has
a skin we want to stream in that bit too
[Music]
unfortunately this function is not const
um that will get fixed after this uh but
to change that to console will require a
huge rebuild of code um this is for the
the programmers going oh my God why did
you change that constant well to
demonstrate and fix the bug I am just
removing it for now just so you can see
the effect don't worry it will be comp
again and we'll hit recode so now if our
attachment has a skin we will also add
it to our merged lot information of the
character and if everything goes
well we will refresh the logs
yeah I have
eyes and now look at that our character
is in HD oh snap his hair is a little
blue but I'm probably just missing a
texture or two however his little straps
are no longer little weird triangles and
you can see a lot more detail and when
we go away out and Beyond now you can
see that his LOD if if you look at the
pixels and the pixels you'll see that it
goes to the correct
log and then when we snap in you can see
the helmet
pop so now we're getting our good High
Fidelity um lods when you're up close
and nearby and
Sham hope you guys enjoyed so as you
guys saw we had a little fun lot issue
um our attachment system is quite
complex we have attachments which Define
how attachment objects should stick to
something could be a character could be
a chair could be a face and there's many
different attachments many different
attachment objects and either one of
those could have a skin where a skin
makes like if I'm a character I now own
that additional
geometry and unfortunately we weren't
checking the the attachment to see if it
had a skin we were only checking the
attachment objects and now we're teing
both of them so we could stream in the
lot information correctly so now our
little character or and that's gigantic
character will have the correct BL when
you're up close and he won't look like a
pixelated 80s game hope you guys enjoyed
see you next time
