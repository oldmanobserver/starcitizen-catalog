Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome to
BugSmashers and I got a joke for you.
So what did the bug say to the code?
It didn’t, it died …Let's get started!
[BugSmashers]
MA: Hey everyone, we’re here in fancy dancy
dying star.
We’re looking at a fun little multiplayer
bug where I have a client on the left and
a client on the right.
Now on the left guy, where I’m look at dictates
where I’m shooting, but as you can see on
the right, my projectiles are always in the
front.
So the client sees one thing and the other
client sees another thing and what is happening
here?
Shenanigans with multiplayer.
As you can see, nothing is getting synced
and it’s a little bit of a problem.
All of our weapons, they all zero in on basically
where this origin is on the reticule unless
it’s fixed, then it goes to the other guy.
However, none of them are actually aiming
towards it on the remote client and well they
can’t because they don’t know where that
player is looking.
However we have in the … where is my code,
here’s my code.
We have something called a weapon controller
and instead of sending network locations for
every single one of those guns because we
could have 10 to who knows, maybe 15 in the
future?
So instead of just sending networks to each
little guy, we just send where the players
looking and then that will make all the guns
look at that location.
Only problem is, it wasn’t sending the information.
So in our weapon controller we have a function
right here which the visor code or where you’re
looking at, tells the weapons controller “Hey
look at here” because this is what the players
looking at, the local player.
This will call update weapons and this will
basically go through all the weapons, cool!
Only problem is, it’s not sending the information
to the clients.
Now the good news is we have a client aspect.
Client aspect means we have some information
for the network that’s going to be sent
out by ‘client owner’, the server dictates
who that client is and if that client gets
the delegation he’ll send his information
to everyone, if the client doesn’t get the
delegation then it will be server controlled.
It is client controlled and we have, where
is it, let's check delegation … We should
have delegation, yup!
We have delegation and if we go into our weapon
controller, it is requesting delegation.
So the guy who uses this thing will get delegation
by the server.
However, it’s not.
So if we go down here, any time we change
our information we’re gonna have to update
our network aspect.
This is saying “hey, yes we have new information
to send everyone because well, we’re dirty’.
So we’ll mark the aspect dirty and it will
flush all the information to the other clients.
Now if I were to compile and test this, it
would be broken because there was another
issue with this other thing that we have called
the network controller.
This is a brand new thing that we’re bringing
to our components, our items.
This is going to be a future thing where it
takes control of all of our aspects, you just
say: ‘hey, I have some float, or some int,
worry about the sinking for me, don’t worry
about setting up aspects or anything crazy,
this will do it’.
It’s kind of our replacement for later things
when we get rid of aspects.
For now, the only thing you have to worry
about is since the item can only be controlled
by one client at the moment because of its
limitation of aspects, which in the future
we want to get rid of… if someone else has
requested it, that means this client will
never ever update and unfortunately the energy
pipes are using that network controller to
request authority only problem is this function
gets called on multiple clients so if you’re
the lucky client over here who gets the information
before me.
You’ll actually get the authority over the
weapon control which we don’t want right
now so that goes goodbye.
In the future, you’ll be able to have more
than one but for now we have to stick with
our current networking scheme so we get rid
of that and make sure this is changed.
So now we have recoded and unfortunately we
have to kind of reset the state because it
gave the delegation to another client so we’re
going to hop out of our seat and then hop
back in.
This will call basically reset all of the
states of the items so when the player actually
sits down he’ll get the authority, bam.
Let me hold down my magic ALT key, so if I
fire on the bottom you see on the bottom,
if I fire on the top, you see it on the top,
if I fire on the right, you see it on the
right.
Everything has network synced, oh my gosh.
I hope you guys liked that little tid bit,
weee.
Just blow him up, die!
That’s how you win.
Alright everyone, as you saw here we had a
little fun networking issue.
We have a thing called delegation with our
networking which allows a client to take control
of an item and say, “Server, here’s some
information” or maybe send information to
other clients, cool.
Only problem is you can only have one of those
per item and it’s just not scalable and
we’re working on stuff to allow you to have
more delegations.
So, maybe we have a power plant some guy is
able to fiddle with these settings while another
guy is able to turn it on or change some other
stuff.
For right now, only one client can take control
of it and because of that we were using the
new scheme on the old system and it just got
wonky so we had to make sure only one guy
can take control and then we had to make sure
the final thing is if we do have a change
we flush the network and tell everyone about
it.
Hope you guys enjoyed and until next time.
