e
welcome everybody welcome to another
special subscriber edition of reverse
the ver
reverse the verse reverse the verse I'm
your community manager Jared hucke just
back from vacation welcome everybody oh
I'm going outside my box
here hold on what is that all right uh
with us today are members of the Austin
engineering team uh we've got with us Mr
Ahmed Ahmed say hello to the to the nice
fans hi everybody ahed uh we have Mr
Jason say hi Jason hey and Mr Tom hello
Mr Tom I'm still saying Mr first names
because I'm terrible with last names but
is it it's it's it's Tom Sawyer it's
Jason Eli and El see that's why mad with
things and Ahmed why don't you just say
your last name it's Sher Sher yes Shaker
there y see that's why I don't even
bother trying I don't even know why I
tried anymore so uh if you if You' never
watched one of our special subscriber D
Shar TVs uh once a month we do a special
broadcast anybody can watch but we take
questions exclusively from our
subscribers
the subscribers are the subset of our
backers who subsidize all of our
broadcasts like around the verse reverse
the verse uh Buck Smashers the monthly
jump machine itself I'm sorry oh we we
are having an issue hearing we can't
hear you you can't hear me at
all all
right yeah go ahead and cut it um sorry
Tom was asking about the air conditioner
uh basically they they the subscribers
uh subsidize all of the output that we
put out to the community um and this is
one of those things so if you're
interested in asking questions to the
engineering team we are taking questions
exclusively from our subscriber chat you
can go to robertsspaceindustries.com
community/ chat and open up the
subscriber tab uh of course you have to
be a subscriber to have access to the
subscriber tab uh for any reason you're
not a subscriber and you'd like to
become one you can check the uh the main
menu at the top of the website for
information about how to become a
subscriber so why don't we start uh why
don't we start talking a little bit
about who we are and what you guys do so
folks can uh can uh tailor their
questions specifically to you guys
because there's there's a lot of
misconceptions about what an engineering
team does uh a lot of folks were were
calling you the devops team earlier you
know in the week and stuff like that so
let's let's start the broadcast by
clearing up a lot of misconceptions uh
before we get started so Ahmed why don't
you start us off and tell us a little
bit about what it is that you actually
do for cloud Imperium games so yeah um
principal Dev Ops engineer mainly I take
care of day day-to-day operation of all
game Cloud infrastructure and uh I take
care of the automation configuration
with a large team uh we have I I think
most of the subscribers know a bunch of
the names we have on a team we have
miles Kagan Andy Nate Jey P Gerard
that's the def Ops Team I'm here to
presen my team not just myself and yeah
we we are the people that run all the
cloud infrastructure and take care of
the builds that you guys get to see and
play all
okay and where did you come to where did
you come to us from you where were you I
came from the web industry this is my
first gaming job I I had gaming CL like
game Studio clients before but they were
mainly doing like web uh games uh I came
from operation and a startup uh in Egypt
called spir systems we were mainly uh
supporting uh startups struggling
underload our our big biggest bigger
segment or like the biggest segment we
had of clients were mainly people who
have very high traffic in a very short
period of times you know how to manage
their scaling they want to move from
being in bare metal to virtualization to
Cloud move between Cloud providers so
yeah my background was mainly in in the
cloud and the scaling area automation
all of that and when I Saw the J
posting a very high fidelity MMO that
needs to run in the cloud that was very
interesting the statefulness in the game
all of that is completely different from
anything in the web so um I I thought
and I was correct that it will bring of
like some crazy challenges that I've
never seen before and here I am have
been here for uh a year and 3 months
almost gotcha we'll come back to that
how uh M an MMO that runs in the cloud
is is is different and an interesting
challenge want to get to the other
introductions here Jason uh tell us what
you do for for cloud Imperium games um
well I'm in charge of the architecture
of the backend Services um pretty much
on a day-to- day um you know we identify
what the you know what game features
need as far as back and services and um
you know help design the proper services
and interaction between those in the
game um you know pretty much just make
the world work on the in the back end
right the things that people don't see
we're kind of underappreciated in that
sense but when something happens we're
the first ones to fair enough uh can you
give us an example of what a backend
service is uh yes like a friend service
um we have the we just you know we have
persistence now which basically is in
charge of of uh bringing uh items from
the game servers into the database and
um you know that sort of thing uh we
also have uh the general instance
manager which is um essentially in
charge of spooling up and shutting down
game instances and managing game
sessions okay and that's different from
net code yeah uh Network code is more
between the clients and the actual game
server the game server would be you know
like you're Arena commander game
sessions or when you're actually flying
around in Crusader um that's the more
real time um you know twitch type of
play um the backend Services is more um
you know it's it's um the stuff between
the servers as opposed to yeah command
and control yeah command and control
gotcha all right and uh Tom what do you
do for cloud and premium games uh yeah I
work with uh you know Jason here I'm a
senior server programmer um as well and
uh yeah you know just uh working on the
back end as well just uh with all the
services that we have in the back end
dealing with a lot of the command and
control tools that you know we give the
QA guys and live Ops Team you know so
that we have you know some idea of
what's going on in real time both in the
public test realm and the live and
things like that and of course anytime
there's an issue uh you know I log in
and uh you know I'm you know doing heart
surgery on live servers uh you know in
production and stuff uh behind the
scenes you know uh sometimes you know
there are issues uh when we do a fresh
deployment something that's been you
know built up uh between like a 24 and a
241 and things like that just uh making
sure everything works so yeah got yeah
the three of us here are pretty much the
primary fire fighters we're the first
line of defense in most cases yes
something goes wrong it is very common
in the uh 24 to 48 hours after a new
patch goes out to to see you guys in
Skype at all hours of the
night yeah yeah so do doing some uh very
risky stuff but you know the The Show
Must Go On you we must uh keep these
servers up and running the best we can
so absolutely and Jason where where were
you before Cloud Imperium games um a
number of places let's see I started in
the game industry at um origin working
on Ultima and
Crusaders um and then I actually have my
started my own company Asylum software I
started making my own little MMOs uh
Elder lands and lothar online and these
little they small boutique uh type of
games retro style things so nothing on
the scale of this um and that's where I
got into actually you know building you
know massive online worlds and such so
this is really attractive coming over
here to this it's on such a grand scale
um I also worked at Qualcomm as a a
server engineer over there um building
um you know high performance Network
applications all right and how about you
Tom where were you before this um I was
I was with the Sony PlayStation for
almost a decade in uh San Diego um I was
with the online Technology Group and uh
we built up uh you know network library
libraries and server architecture for
first party and second party Studios and
you know by the time I left uh you we
shipped about 160 uh Playstation titles
using the framework um I mean I have to
admit you know I'm more of an FPS guy
before I came to you know Cloud Imperium
games you know you kind of do things a
little bit differently and now that you
know uh we're in MMO there's a whole
different set of uh problems to solve
and uh that's where Jason is you know
really really helpful you know just
having his MMO experience and uh
persistence you know itemization
itemization is you know in my mind the
most technical complex part an MMO just
you know managing just all these items
that can be traded with other players
you can purchase them on a website and
it syns up and um you know trade yeah
tradeable in mailboxes and shops and
stuff so and this is a completely
different Beast as far as itemization in
an MMO I mean we're on like orders of
magnitude more yeah than other MMOs so
you know this uh this uh you know 24
release is huge uh there's a huge
investment uh to get ionization done
right with persistence and then of
course you know when we're talking about
persistence we're talking about account
based persistence you know your player
your your stuff your ships and things
like that but we're going to be growing
over time as soon as we have like uh you
know instance persistence and you know
more of a worldwide persist yeah
there'll be there's so much more
persistent data coming but the most
important right now is to get an
itemization for players so when they
they're in the game and they acquire
items when they change the load out on
their ship if that stuff persists
between sessions between um build now
persistence is something that it's
fundamental for every MMO we we talk
about it a lot like it's like it's a
major thing for us and and and it is but
I it is a it's like tires on a car you
can't have an MMO without resistance so
one of the reasons it's such a big deal
for us that we talk about as much is
because no other MMO is out at this
point in development no other MMO is is
publishing you know an alpha
prior to the creation of their
persistent you know database and and the
cash and all these backend systems and
what so I mean we hear we hear a lot of
chat from the community about you know
why is persistence such a big deal and
why not it's it's it's a big deal
because it is a it is a huge milestone
in our development it's something we
always knew had to come it's it's
something that's been on the road map
since the beginning but because we're
building this game out in front of
people we're building we're allowing
them to play it as we build it and
whatnot they're experiencing this
Milestone that every MMO goes through at
some point but they're experiencing it
as it happens instead of months and and
in most cases years after this Milestone
happens in development uh what can you
tell us about building persistence while
everybody is sitting there
watching um well I guess I'll say that
it's
um it's something that's definitely
needed people don't don't realize you
know the importance of it it's it's not
a sexy feature to promote you know for
pr- wise because it's an expected
feature it's not like hey we got this
great new feature over here it's got a
lot of blinging you all are going to
love it it's it's more of an expected
thing but it takes a huge amount of work
and um you know um we had to be very
careful on how we brought it into the
universe we had to bring it in at the
right time we had to make sure a lot of
the uh game design was you know the
itemization and such was was kind of
hammered out and you know it's never
100% you know like we still have a lot
of data that's yet to be designed before
we can persist it but we had to get the
players inventory their ships or
entitlements uh you know their pledges
and such we had to make sure that
there's a lot of things locked down with
that before we could even begin a
strategy on how how to persist it
because there's a lot more that goes on
behind the scenes especially with this
game considering that we have you know
your average players going to have
thousands upon thousands of items rather
than hundreds has NE MMOs um we had to
take uh very specific approaches and
tailor the data in such a way to where
we can't we don't get into situations
where we're bogged down we have
throughput issues and such like that so
it's a it's definitely an all Hands-On
de feature because uh you know not only
do the server programmers have the
backend uh to to manage all this data um
you know for you know potentially 50 to
250 you know thousand current players
and just managing all this data and
stuff and with our caching
Services um but you know you got the
gameplay guys you got the UI team you
know that have to you know have visual
display plays inside the game so that
you can manipulate uh the different
items and move them around and stuff and
uh get those uh you know changes you
know taking place pushing back up to the
persistent cach service and then we got
these old Delta timers actually right to
the database you know we've got uh you
know these these middle tiers business
tiers you know to to manage you know the
items uh so that we have complete
control of when rides to the database if
we didn't have those middle tiers and
you know oh my God we would we would
blow the database driver out water with
all these you know transactions coming
through right we have to have you know
these different tiers because um one
particular game server with may have
like 30 people or 20 people on it
whatever and a lot of items are changing
and being sent to the caching layer um
which holds the data for certain amount
of time and then we'll write to the
database in a controlled in a controlled
manner but when we have a 100 game
servers you know that that becomes more
problem so we have to have multiple
layers of throttling and caching in
order to um um have complete control
over the rate at which data comes into
the system and into the backend system
and and into the database in a way to
where we don't kill the database and
plus the auditing uh tools you know so
that customer uh support and uh you know
QA and all that stuff you know for every
item in the game you know we can get a
history of where it was at any given
time when it got traded when it got sold
to a vendor when it was purchased or you
know deleted from the website and got
resync you know with the universe you
know cluster things like that so there's
a lot of command and control Tools in
place is to you know manage items so now
Ahmed you talked a bit about uh building
MMO in the cloud and how that's
different than uh talk talk to us about
what what makes Star Citizen in the
cloud such a unique thing
so not not to get too much back when
when when the cloud movement started
people said it's not for everyone you
cannot just take your app and put in the
cloud in a VM because it doesn't matter
whether you have it in a very have it in
a VM in a small kind of hosal Provider
to be in one of the big public clouds
you have to use the other abstraction
layers that the cloud provides to you
the cloud provides to you object storage
block storage that can move between VMS
VMS can be migrated different concepts
of firewall different concept of vbn and
everything is offered to you as a
service that's a lot of good work
happening for you saving you and your
team from doing all this tedious work
that's technically inventing the wheel
however
you are relying
on uh resources shared among other
people so every single public CL
provider tells you you got to design for
failure expect me to go down at any
moment expect this to happen expect this
to change and the statelessness so in
web websites most of the time people
will try to obtain what we call like
there's no State get within the firal
resource that might diet any moment and
I have the state saved outside in
redundant form and can be accessed in
different ways which is the the basic
concept of distribute systems having
this in the web is like being a first
class citizen in a country that talks
your language everyone does this and you
look at everyone other Playbook and
steal a game from him and just do it and
people go thre him towards that games
are the complete opposite they are very
very stateful an MMO is extremely
stateful it's not even match based it's
not session based so you expect that you
leave your machine running for 24 hours
if you can hold standing out for 24
hours playing and you want this to
happen and also you're not going to
tolerate having a 404 or 5002 that you
see in the website in the middle of that
huge epic game where you get like your
amazing Lo whatever you are looking for
so given this sort of a stability in the
cloud is not really easy and dealing
with the cloud quirks because yeah the
cloud does a lot of good work for me but
also takes a lot of control out of my
hand I could oh I could have made this
thing worked that thing in this way and
stopped the password here and only
replicated this half and I can't I'm
using whatever the struction layer the
club provider provided me and the tools
I'm using just like anyone else so the
challenge is MMO games are an alien in
the cloud while all the web technology
are the first class citizen so be being
this kind of alien that no one else is
doing what we so we have been watching a
lot of companies when Z go and talk with
with other tools other conferences
talking about their Cloud adaptation not
a lot of people really manage to have
the simulator which is the dedicated
game server in the cloud efficiently
having everything working fine and
that's the challenge there are people
that did what I mentioned in the
beginning they took their original data
center bare metal infrastructure and
carried it and put it in the cloud on
DMS and it's the same exact way that's
not what we're trying to do and it's a
challenge because as I mentioned and uh
to get a tiny bit technical if if you
want to use a new tool too late too
late if you want to use a new tool in
the cloud or a new service in the cloud
and you you C in a modern language and
your use case is just create like a CR
something that you create to remove
records and all of that you would find
an example within five minutes and
you'll look at it and you just saved
your yourself a lot of time and then
move from there using a C++ using a game
that's a
different like thing to deal way now
you're talking about challenges uh we
have some plans in place to address
these challenges uh some some of them
we're we're not quite ready to talk
about yet um certain reveals of certain
things we like to leave to Chris and
what to to talk about when when the time
comes but uh in the in the broadest
sense in the stuff that's not going to
get us in trouble tonight uh what can
you what can you tell us about uh how
we're facing those challenges yes so the
way we look at it we want to implement
what's currently being known as the
event driven data center how to have so
the more I provide what we call
sometimes fluid resources the games that
they can move I deployment time like
they call these Main buzzwords in our
business devops the time to Market how
fast would it be for me to scale a game
server for you how how easy would me to
retain resources I not need how can I
repurpose resource es uh because the
cloud is mostly a utility computing you
pay for what you use M uh and that's a
completely different approach then you
own your data center and built it and
now these stuff are yours and then he
use it you not use it that's different
story so we back to my original idea I
was talking about we we want to
implement the event driven data center
that every piece of of of software that
goes through a major event that the
infrastructure should know about would
find an event through a a a wide channel
of info buses that have reactors
reacting to it and acting upon it that's
that's the big picture so and we can
orchestrate this the way we want because
orchestration is is the is the word here
that's that's what you need to know you
need to make all the all the logic that
all that Jason and Tom and the gameplay
guys are writing react or like report
what it needs and my infrastructure
reacts to it whether by expanding by
replacing by oh that's that's that's a
bad
uh member of our cluster we should take
should take that oh no this is not going
to get Auto healed or self healed we got
to walk Amad up THS up that's the plan
uh move to that
and uh the way we usually do it in div
Ops and even in backend Services shops
you cannot really sit in a room and get
this amazing big white paper and draw
everything it's impossible you will
definitely have bad designs so we go
through the MVB like the minimum value
product okay this this will deliver my
idea I'm going to scale right now or I'm
going to make the players get in the
game and watch because maybe there might
be a new feature I'm not really putting
in my mind or maybe it's it's the same
concept that all the successful startups
followed like how Facebook believe that
you should move fast and break things
however you until you go out the market
the market correct you that's also goes
really correct your point in the
beginning about persistence if we laid
out persistence before seeing the game
itself and came the game with a get
going we'll be just going breaking walls
and moving around them while right now
we are more mature we can start from a
point where we understand this this is
what the game looks like the game
designers had their time this discussed
some ideas bounce it back and forth it
the implementation is going to be a lot
easier when you have something to test
way at one point we didn't even have any
of the game data design we nobody knew
what we had to persist for example so we
had actually go through several meetings
and to figure out what are we going to
persist and how are we going to do it y
i i remember those meetings sitting
there like no he go the players have
this and the players have this and and
this needs to sit up with turbulent and
this needs this this needs to be P
pulled down and and live in the universe
so oh yeah and there's a lot of
transitioning on ownership and
communication of all that data yeah I
mean that's still evolving today
absolutely I mean there's still game
systems Yet to Come online that will
have to be integrated into persistence
as it goes um we're going to get to the
we're GNA get to your subscriber
questions in just a minute I want to ask
uh Jason and Tom one more question uh
follow up on you were talking about the
scale of the game and how the scale of
Star Citizen dwarfs things that you'd
worked on before uh talk to us a little
bit about the scale of Star Citizen we
can start with
itemization um like a game like World of
Warcraft for example you can have on the
you can have hundreds of items on the
character and that seems like a lot yeah
a lot of items to keep track of and so
on and store in your inventory or in
your bank and so on where in Star
Citizen just with your ships you know
the things that you buy on the website
right now you are already in the
thousands and you can easily have
players with uh you know we're going to
have north of 50,000 items and
associated with one player um that's a
scale that I've never had to deal with
before but it's um you know it's
something that we're you know we've been
able to put a lot of thought into and
figure out the best way to deal with it
and you know and it's still going to
evolve because you know at some point if
we you know have a million online at one
time that's a 50,000 per player that's a
lot of data to move around
so so you know before persistence you
know our our architecture was very
firstperson shooter like um you know
coming from Sony uh the initial server
cluster kind of looked like you know uh
some of the models that we had over at
Sony um you know where we had 250,000
concurrent uh with the simulators um you
know with that type of framework uh we
know where to scale horizontal if we
break from 250 to a million uh we know
what we need to Federate next so um
taking those principles uh for from
selling and applying to cig um you know
we can we can most likely hit those same
numbers but once you add persistence
then we have to you know go back to the
drawing board and you know figure figure
out where the bottlenecks are going to
be what services are need to get
Federated you know horizontally and
things like that so yeah yeah like we've
uh we we're writing all of our um
services and C+ plus just for the
performance and um we can you know any
any given service can handle
a large number of players and a large
amount of data passing through it um so
one of the ways we're going to scale
like Thomas saying horizontally is we
have to there's two things to consider
there's you know we have to uh load
balancing and then um availability so we
have to make sure that if any service
goes down that you know there's
something else there another one there
to pick it up or whatever that there
that the service that that that this the
service is always available no matter no
matter what so we'll have multiple
instances of a particular service up at
any given time and if one goes down
there's another one available and so on
the load balancing aspect would be um
just to distribute
Pro nope across multiple instances of a
particular service definitely want to
apply the uh the the mega server um you
know methodologies you know where you
have a single login and just like a
single universe that you um are in where
you can play with anybody around the
world rather than fragmenting up uh you
know the player base on a ser server
basis that once you lock into a server
that's it you know you can only interact
with those people so we're trying to you
know design that upfront um so with the
mega server uh architecture in mind for
both uh you know persistence and you
know the regular matchmaking and uh
persistent Universe uh Concepts yeah and
the the services themselves right now
like players and objects have a location
so we already view them as a location in
one universe and there's you know other
technical issues that have to be
addressed with the game servers and and
interaction in the instances and stuff
like that to um to really make the
players feel like they are in that one
large universe but we've already been
we've already been fighting that battle
on on on the back end and uh you used a
buzz word just a few minutes ago and I
can already tell the questions are
coming in what's a mega
server um one giant world it's
essentially a collection of servers of
services working together to give the
perception of one world one server right
rather than like World of Warcraft you
know we got a list of like 250 servers
that you know once you join you know
you're locked into that yeah and this is
pretty interesting it's an interesting
challenge because we have to not only
deal with us players we have to uh you
know consider people in Europe and in
Asia and South America and so on so we
Australia don't leave Australia out I'll
I said don't leave Australia out I'll
get post oh Australia
yeah it's it's a global Mega server so
we have to make sure that the players
feel that you know they are there and
that they that they can play with their
us friends they can play with their
European friends whomever you know then
it feels like your next door you know
you're not transitioning into another
realm type of thing gotta all right guys
so we'll start taking questions from our
subscribers uh again subscribers uh if
you wish to ask a question of uh Ahmed
Tom or Jason you can type your question
into the subscriber chat on the RSI
website uh please preface your question
with the word question surrounded by
brackets uh it'll help me pick it out
through the uh through the chat we are
not taking question from either twitch
chat or the regular General chat on our
website strictly through the subscriber
chat uh first question up is from China
shop Rodeo he wants to know have you
ever had a typo break everything uh
similar to inst instances where DNS
configurations have brought down the
cloud uh to Chrome pointing entire
workflow workflows to some other
website I did have one of these none of
us never had one of these yeah one time
so the the way we deploy our environment
is very well known in the cloud and the
devops industry by the word green blue
deployments that we would have a full
environment running whether it's BTU or
Live players can see it and then we St
we stage a shadow environment complete
full and then at the moment we just
switched the little balance from the BL
it moved so um I can't remember was it
22 I can't remember it was and I had to
edit very very large file with a lot of
different I mean we are an alpha project
so sometimes we broke our own rules and
you would I'm gonna test it right before
I do it yeah yeah we have no time um the
thing that we have in they Ops and I
think we have an Austin we deliver
whatever the company needs to be
delivered as quick as possible and when
never it needed to be delivered so yeah
it was one of these things where you
hack something really quick and I have
an extra space in a URL that goes for a
platform Avis uh in a very gigantic
dictionary that will generate a lot of
configuration that will go to the
services and this space led to issue
with authentication so QA was testing
trying to get in and nothing is working
and it it took a while that the edor
message wasn't very very clear so yeah
the these things always happen but the
good thing is we did not do it in
production production we had it in the
staging one so we get to fix it and see
it and I'm sure like every person
running a live production servers all
the time get to see some of these human
errors
yeah all right uh jiru has a question he
wants to know if you use common
framework like Springs or struts on the
back
end uh if I remember right spring and
struts uh you know was a you know Java
jav J2 framework uh our our universe
cluster is primarily C++ uh with some
thirdparty libraries uh that we
customize but uh the web platform on the
otherand do use a lot of web- based you
know Technologies and stuff so okay uh
catastrophe
disastrophe a combination of disaster
and catastrophe
disastrophe good name uh what
configuration management tools does the
team use to administer configure servers
in the cloud also what kind of log
analysis management tools are used yeah
um I'm not a huge fan of of of focusing
on the brands but like yeah we uh we
currently use chef and we use bunch of
our uh home rou scripts that mainly does
the provisioning so I'm gonna try to
talk like in
a we can bring up we can bring up a
graph that would explain a lot of my
work and a lot of what we do what you
mean you had a graph ready SC and I
picked this question just for this what
we didn't rehearse this and pull up this
all right yeah
that's so if we start all the way in the
right you guys can see Aus that's where
everything is being built current build
system is based on a build system called
buildbot uh it's highly modified uh and
customized to our own needs the way it
schedules uh and and manage the Fanning
in fanning out all dependency everything
in the in the build system is is custom
made for us so the outcome from the
build system will be a build which is
all the binaries needed to run the
client to run the server under the back
end services and a bunch of other files
they get uploaded to object storage in
the cloud as you can see still on eyy
and from there now we have the build we
want to deliver it as fast as possible
our current cloud provider gives us
uh a good Advantage here that we can
create an AAL box at this moment and we
pull the bill down and we do whatever we
want to do in the O at this moment like
install packages make sure that we
change your limits make make sure that
everything is optimized the way you want
it and then we create snapshots from
both the this prodct takes a few minutes
usually 20 minutes 25 minutes it high
depends on the when link content I mean
how who's fighting with me over
uploading something it could be me too
uploading somewhere else so yeah this is
mainly like internet speed kind of limit
and
then we get the snapshot the snapshot
can create desks and these desks can be
shared across the whole cluster so if we
scroll back up again now you understand
that the build existed in the snapshot
you as a player sitting here that's your
game client you start your launcher
Batcher and your launcher Bacher would
go grab the build for you from the CDN
the CDN or the contact delivery network
is bunch of uh endpoints uh globally
distributed trying to deliver you as
fast as possible the files that you need
and you pull them down in your game
client now you have the Bild the Bild
needs to connect so you you would have
some connection between you and the Hub
low balancer that takes you to the hub
servers all of them these so you have
bunch of different Hub servers that
handle your connection you go there over
TCP The Hub servers go to the platform
make sure that you are the guy who you
claim you are and you have a connection
with the platform from here the Hub
service will take your traffic to most
of the services that Tom and Jason did
here in the core server they live in a
single box and and we can say why they
live in a single box for now and one of
them is the persistence Services we have
two main Services persistence cach and
persistance service itself as they
connect to our mySQL database clusters
that has Masters and slaves and back
having all these schol stuff and here
you set all you dedicated Game servers
and different game servers all these
boxes I
drawn uh represent an environment any
Cloud environment right now in Cloud
andum games has to be three different
VMS with three different types of rules
one of them for the Hub one of them for
all the core services and one of them
for the game game server this is not any
way near final that's what we need now
to get everything running and see how we
want to scale and change of stuff uh the
difference between environment between
QA BTU on live QA is one one one BTU is
multiple of these one of these multiple
of these live is much
larger uh the question that he asked
also relates to these bunch of servers
we have our infrastructure servers we
have log aggregation systems we have
monitoring systems tools for diff
support and tools for analytics uh we
use Chef here we use bunch of home RO
scripts here and over here we have a
Splunk we have uh a graphite graph
statsd uh we have a stack driver uh we
have bunch of uh uh core dump like
analysis to look like we have bunch of
servers have GDB server for developers
to look at we have some stuff related to
Google break I I I want not like I know
that we have a lot of backers who came
from technical background and as H posts
so I'm trying to keep imbalance where
like I use a lot of technical jar and
then I go back to something high level
so yeah this is not any weird final
actually right now if I mentioned that
we are working on a new deployment by
line that would be the way that been
driven the center I was talking about or
the scaling in and out or like out yeah
in and out would would be like easy and
and usable under heavy load all right
turn this off very cool let's get you
back on
screen wrong
buttons all right so thank you for
having that graph all all set up
on uh our next question is a is a very
uh popular question about patch
reduction sizes uh what can uh Ean
Dragon wants to know if you can Pro uh
what Insight you can provide as to the
progress of uh patch reduction the the
uh the system that checks and and sends
you only the files that you need instead
of everything else I want what can you
tell us about that system yeah that this
project is running lots of caffeine lots
of people across the world this is one
of the biggest projects that we have and
it involves people from so many
different uh departments we have people
from Devas we have people from it people
from engine programmers people in the
platform everyone is working together to
have our own Bacher and I also like the
launcher system or the new Bach delivery
system is not going to only affect the
players it's going to affect even our
internal developers the way that they
deliver receive their own builds
actually our internal developer has kind
of an educ case the real to the player
outside in the world because you pull a
lot of builds all the time so yeah work
work work is running I see I see all
that the that change list coming in and
out I see all the commits happening we
get to have meetings every now and then
to make sure that we are all still have
the same features that we require from
from the from the whole system it it's
going to be awesome I mean our
our so we feel really bad that when we
deliver three builds for you guys in one
single day you can only play the last
one because you by the time you finish
the first one and we want to give you
this seamless kind like I'm a devops guy
and I live for the world that that has
my TSA on all what I care about is
giving you the content that ready for
you as fast as possible so having a
smaller batch is a key for all of us MH
yeah it's been working yeah it's one of
those challenges again because we're
operating a live environment at such an
early point in our development you know
any other game would have you know
persistence would be in the the this
this low-level patching system would be
in all this stuff would be in before
they even started their first Alpha so
um and and uh it's it's Mike is it Mike
picket who's working on that you yes
Mike picket Mike picket was one of the
very first people that was talking about
this issue having his own design on it
at I like it extends it extends to a lot
of people because that that the way we
are looking at it to do everything right
you have to have this system native and
all the end points that need to use it
so every part should be aware of it to
deliver this kind of experience we like
I'm downloading now the game is playable
then it can be a complete all these fun
amazing good stuff need to be done and
the scale always the scale is the key
that you need to do this right you need
to do this that
that's not an NG game I mean we we are
yeah it's a startup but we understand
how big our community is so when we
build a foundation technology like this
we need to look at all edge cases make
sure everything will work even if we
have 1 million people downloading right
now because we don't not really want to
be the ones that have our own success
our our game is very successful by it is
right now and we are here just to serve
the
success gotta yeah it's it's I wanted to
show throw a shout out to Mike you know
we have a very large team uh with our
video content Community only in one
place and so now in two places now we
have Austin uh we only get to Showcase a
select few number of faces you know week
in week out but we have we have a a huge
team of people working on just about
every aspect of this game so we like to
like to give shout outs wherever
possible so Mike good work I've never
met you I've never even talked to you
but I know your name and I know your
work I know your working your butt off y
so uh so thanks Mike all right what else
do we got here um we have a we put up a
thread over the weekend to collect some
questions early um there was one that we
have to ask where was
it uh something about Ahmed being
awesome I can't find it yeah there it
goes C droma asked this question
specifically for Amed why are you so
amazing um it's the glasses I don't know
uh Laura turnis asks what color network
cable is is your Nemesis he says his his
he hates the light purple ones he hates
the light purple Network caes he brings
up good memories like dealing with with
stuff that I can touch with my hands
like stopped a while ago like a few
years ago when we had the to wire cables
and remember which wiring and what
colors we hit yeah that that's how we
start nowadays we forget about all these
stuff and that's the beauty of the cloud
we tell us stuff to happen and they
happen you don't all always happen the
right way and that's our job to make
sure always come out the right way uh
but yeah I don't know I can't remember I
didn't I didn't wire a network cable for
a while I didn't touch an
rg55 this for a yes no I I I I ran my
own IT company for a number of years and
and absolutely whenever possible I got I
got some intern or somebody to wire my
cables cuz I I just getting down into
the nitty-gritty and then remember try
to try you you do a on one end and then
B on the other one you're like what the
heck was you know you start questioning
you start thinking
moment happened after 20 actually this
this bringed up that that talk about the
cable a few years ago none of us would
have imagined that was one single person
that you'll be running 1500 cores that's
the beauty of the cloud because we're
talking about the cloud a lot when two
went up I'm not going to talk about
concurrency but there was a lot of cours
running under Star Citizen name at our
club provider and having this over seen
by one or two people is is how cool it
is that we don't really need to worry
about the cables the TRS all these stuff
at this
phase uh Daz asks a question that we're
not going to answer but I want to ask it
uh to to explain why we're not going to
answer it because this type of question
comes up quite often Dez asks hey guys
in some M MMOs bought armies that set
out to grind currency become an issue
what is being done to prevent exploits
farming from being an issue um whe we
get asked a lot what we're going to do
to prevent cheating and stuff like that
uh we don't answer those questions
because we don't want the bad guys to
know what we're doing so I it's I I I
understand why the good guys would want
to know uh what what the things that
we're doing the details and how we're
going to go about it it's just one of
those uh catch 22s where when we the
more info on those things that we put
out the more info the bad guys have to
circumvent so just know that Jason's got
a lot of tricks up his seve if you know
based on his experience and so the best
thing to do you don't answer the
question but you make them you know you
make sure that they know we're watching
we know what they're going to do and
make them paranoid so we will catch them
yep we know who you are Robert oh yeah
command and control command and
control
um uh we hear a lot about uh client
frame rate and server frame rate yeah is
that something you can speak about what
what what dictates a server frame rate
and how that can affect I can so there
there's not a clear luck point I mean
that that's that's not my area of
ownership of work that's the area I'm
like very first close neighbor to I do
believe that we have a very very
specific lock step but this is what
locks the client right right like the
client frame rate is usually the rate at
which you're refreshing your your your
the graphics and so on so um on the
server side on the dgs we call it the
dgs um that's the simulation rate and
they're they're not locked together so
okay all we can yeah absolutely and I
know a lot of players are concerned with
the FPS and uh I I was planning I first
of all I want to ask every single person
who plays BTU and all the amazing people
who play avocati and the great people
that I woke up during the night is like
hey I have a new combination I wanted to
stay and people calling each other and
coming online this is amazing I haven't
seen anything I can imagine this even
possible in my interview a year and a
few months ago I was asking ah two you
guys teaching me about games how do you
guys just test it's like us people it's
like what do you mean it's like our our
Gamers our players are awesome I can't
believe that we'll be able like I have a
new case I want to test it so like you
will see it will happen in a few minutes
you just say you want to test that
you'll find people coming from nowhere
so uh uh all what you guys we try to do
at BTU is defining pain points that
should be addressed uh optimization is
is a deep rabbit hole that you need
always to be worried about reatur
optimization so but also we have a
product out in the market that you guys
are playing want to make it blable and
fun so all what I'm trying to Aid myself
and my team with the guys working in
Frankfurt and guys work in the UK and
over here in LA to try to point them as
much as we can to that main pinpoint
like oh if you spend sometime in this we
might get some Advantage yeah but what
we have right now is nowhere near to
what we would deliver we have so many
checks in our bags that we know it's not
the right time for us to like battle
test them but we really need to care
about like yeah you guys were suffering
that much and we enhanced it 10% 5% 7%
yeah it's still livable and we still
having an eye on what's going on and
also sometimes we are not willing to
enhance anything right now but we want
to see did did did our new cuder logic
or or complexity taxed us a lot did it
became very expensive or not so thank
you so much guys for all the amazing
work you do testing BTU yeah there's a
rad Telemetry profiles being generated
all the time and that gets uh you know
disseminated too you the teams
appropriately and stuff so people will
have on their radar what is most
expensive on on the game servers as well
as the client stuff and you know just
you know tackle it at the right time but
there's just so many features going into
the game it's you know like I say pre
premature optimization and stuff once
you start doing uh optimizing code you
know it looks a little different than
normal and you don't want to come over
and say hi right and there's a wide
range of things that we can optimize I
mean uh from the client side you're
going to have you know things from
render ing uh you're going to have a
client side simulation and also you're
going to have Network latency then on
the back end there's you know there's
all the physics and all the other things
that happen there uh then there's also
things that um where the game servers
May rely on responses from the the the
the services and so there's a a wide
number so we don't want to pre- optimize
now but when we start you know and we do
and we we optimize certain things over
time the low hanging fruit and such like
that but um you know there's so many
different departments that are going to
you know focus on their little areas but
we have to focus on them at the right
time like you know we pre-optimized now
we could end up paying ourselves in the
corner later exactly there's probably I
mean there's probably nothing more
important in game development than
prioritization I mean we talk about the
size of our team and our team is massive
but it's still finite there's only so
many things they can work on at any
given time and and when you know when
when you know something is temporary
when you know something is is is meant
to hold us over to get us to the new
system that's coming down you know in a
later patch one you don't want to spend
spend you know too much time optimizing
or or working on the system that you
know is temporary and you're going to
replace so it's a constant Balancing Act
between all the I I it's always that the
picture we the thing we always use was
the guy that was spinning plates you
know all different poles when's spinning
a bunch of plates on top of top of the
10 different poles so when whenever we
were spinning up servers we used to call
them spinning spinning up plates SP disc
and stuff like that uh let's see um the
jabber walk has a question he says says
will the website be hosted served from
the same servers as the game or will
they just access the same back-end
database um the back the website and the
backend services are about to have a
very close relationshipi prior to this
um it's pretty much a they it's always
been us you know the the services and
platform um but we're now coming
together so um we can we would the
services will look at them as another
service and they look at us as part of
their own system so we're kind of we're
getting married
we're using a rful apis right now which
works on the internet but we're
co-located now so we're going to have
dedicated channel so we get B
directional communication yeah we'll
have a set of services that have uh you
know stateful high-speed communication
mechanisms to the platform and um you
know we've been working with them on on
how to architect both sides to uh um
make that as streamless as possible yeah
make the data the the response and the
data and so because and I'll use an
example right now when you buy an
entitlement or you you you purchase a
ship on on on the website um it there's
no way for platform to tell us that you
purchase the ship so when you log in we
grab your package which contains all the
items that you all the ships that you
purchase and so on and then we know
about it and then we can you know create
the actual and gain items and persist
them um but with the highp speed the the
new this new highspeed Communication
System um the moment you buy a ship they
will notify us we can expand the ship
immediately and have it ready for you by
the time you log in the game and when it
comes to Community Based Fe features you
know like statistics and achievements
and and things like that a lot of those
a lot of those uh features really are
best imple implemented with like a web-
based technology um and then just if we
have a a direct line communication we
can just you know trigger those things
immediately so and we'll be able to call
functions from them directly as of you
know like as a service and so on and
there's an API we provided for them as
well so they can uh request any data
from us and generate events we can
generate events back and forth to each
other it's one of that that's what's one
of the things that's so awesome about
working with a partner like turbulent so
are they're awesome yeah it's the first
time I uh you know got on a project
where the website was done before the
game yes and then so much we all think
about we all think about solving the
problems in the same way so it's it's a
very good match and so much of the
functionality like ship ownership and
and all the stuff it all exists on the
website and now we're pulling that down
into the game yeah know it's uh it it's
great to have that kind of Buy in from a
partner because you know when ever
you're working with a third party vendor
you never quite know exactly what the
level of buying is you know this is on
any project not just video games and
whatever so we're we're continuously
very lucky to have Partners like
turbulent with the with the level of
buying they have so uh Beno I love
you I love you all right
so uh Captain Steve we we're we're
wrapping up here fast run out of time he
wants to know what hypervisor do you use
in the cloud and also what core
operating system do you use to run the
game yeah currently we are in GCE Google
Cloud engine the hypervisor used over
there is their own custom
KVM uh I don't believe that the
hypervisor that we would use would be I
mean yeah there are different way of
elation how we abstract the CBU
instructions from from the bare mle to
the VMS but I don't think we would be
having an issue whether we running on
Zen and on KV
[Music]
welcome back twitch uh if you're not a
streamer you're probably watching a an
ad right now uh basically we had a
computer crash here we're at the end of
our broadcast anyway so we just came
back to say thanks for everybody to for
watching and for supporting us and for
submitting questions um Ahmed Jason Tom
anything you want to say before we let
you
go we are very thankful for ear your
time guys in BTU we're going to have a
stress test at 300 p.m. a little bit
that would be great to have you guys
testing G Cod making sure it looks solid
and nice H yeah we are really grateful
for you guys helping us with all this
staying oldest work that's my end Y and
we're happy to be here you know putting
together something and you know amazing
and giving you all a great gaming
experience got nothing Tom uh I'm just
hoping the PTU goes well so I can fall
asleep tonight so fair enough fair
enough stress test is started starting
in three minutes you can get with Will
and Discord y so so if you're in the PTU
and you have access to Discord jump in
there now we'll be doing our big stress
test for 241 in just a few minutes uh
Ahmed uh Jason Tom thanks so much for
taking the time I know we tried to get
you in last uh last month and you know
work work you know prevailed but uh than
thanks for taking an hour out of your
time to to sit with us and chat with us
and and talk about a little bit about
your work and take some questions from
the fans so guys uh thanks a lot uh
regular RTV is back on Friday uh be sure
to check out uh around the verse episode
100 tomorrow uh it's part one of our of
our multi-part episode 100 uh
celebration so check that out and uh
I'll see you again on Friday so thanks
guys thank you all right have a good
