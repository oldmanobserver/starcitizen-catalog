hey how's it going everybody uh thanks
for joining uh myself for Stefan uh CG
supervisor and Sean Tracy Tech director
Tech Conta director director of tech
content director all things technical um
so U he's going to help us answer help
me answer some questions CU we' got some
great questions this week um i' like to
thank the uh
subscribers uh for making this show
possible um because without you all uh
there would have nothing there'd be
nothing for us to work on no no and we
wouldn't have this awesome platform to
to speak and explain and all the stuff
that we're doing behind the scenes to
give them the uh best an ever and to
give progress on where we're at because
there's so many things and so many
moving Parts happening at all the time
oh right all right well I'm going to go
ahead and get started our first question
is Daz given that procedural planets oh
awesome topic given that procedural
planets are generated from a seed if we
go down to a planet and mine a location
and it becomes depleted what happens
after we leave and this is a two-parter
is the planet permanently altered or
would that location regenerate creating
an area that we can constantly go back
to and exploit well it's an awesome
question and uh first things first just
wanted to explain because I I tend to um
end up answering a lot of questions
related to the procedural Planet stuff
but the the big brains that are really
working on the procedural Planet
technology Are all uh within Frankfurt
so uh guys like Marco corbetta uh Carson
wiel Sasha hoba um Pascal Mueller uh
they're all working pretty much
full-time on the procedural planets now
we get a lot of oversight on them we've
got to blend them into the game uh where
they're working on the tech so um just
consider that uh when I answer any
questions regarding it is that yeah I'm
I'm trying to represent as best as I can
we just get to play with it right but
they're really they're driving all the
tuch that's right they're driving
everything that goes through so to get
to the actual question um it's a really
good question because yes the planets
are generated from a seed but consider
that our game is multiplayer um we can't
generate a different seed for every
single player that goes down to the
planet so um me and Forest can't be
flying towards a planet he sees a
mountain I don't see a mountain I end up
flying through it or whatever um so
that's got to already be kind of set in
stone so when we generate this planet
originally um as a developer yes we will
have a seed um but once you see it as a
player you're always going to see the
same thing now when it comes down to
actually permanently altering the
surface of it what's likely to happen is
is that uh when we do do mining it's
going to be an it's going to be another
object on top of the planet it's not
going to be the planet itself um so no
you probably won't alter the actual
Planet geometry itself or or any of the
seats related to it but you'll alter a
different object that's actually placed
on top of the planet so just to give a
you know really out there example you've
got a big block of ice right that big
block of ice is sitting there on the
planet you fly down you're mining water
out of the ice let's say that ice
disappears now the question is will that
ice then regenerate well it's it's a
design question it's really going to be
up to the designers there's no technical
reason why it can't uh but likely what's
going to be happening is that we've got
an area of ice right there's going to be
a certain number of minerals within a
certain uh pretty large area um and
you're not going to get the exact same
ice blocking the exact that's where the
seed kicks in right so it's not you know
you get the initial Planet generated but
then the objects on the planet that
you're Mining and stuff maybe those have
you know multiple seeds so when it
regenerates itself if it regenerates
itself which I why not that would be
kind of and that's something that we
want to control because it's really
important that we control the
Commodities within our world economics
of the whole thing exactly so you know
it's kind of a long answer to whether it
regenerates or not I would say no it
doesn't actually regenerate but it will
be somewhere else um but the seeds are
all shared so everybody will see the
same thing exactly awesome all right um
tranon asks are there any new animations
or physic effects that you have been
working on and the challenges that you
have encountered there's so much right
there's so much to do with animations
and physics together um It's A system
that is completely interwoven um Evo
herzeg does a lot of work on this
particular system as well as a gentleman
by the name of Chris reain so um what
we've been working on constantly is the
uh Zerg um driven ragd doll kind of
Technology um this is pretty unique uh
to our game um and and The Driven ragd
doll itself isn't unique but the
transition between like an animated
character to driven ragd doll back and
forth and back and forth and going
within physics grid and things like this
um there's a lot of problems uh and a
lot of challenges that that brings um it
might not be super obvious to the
players that we are that we are working
on things within there because from what
they see oh yeah it all works um but
there's little things that we want to
fix uh within
that so um the other uh the other sort
of portion of this that's that's been
very tricky actually to be working on is
the uh skeleton extension portion of
this so has a little bit to do with the
new item Port system but what happens
with the new item Port system is that um
you start as a base skeleton and then
you add on let's say a head or a helmet
um and that skeleton actually extends so
we have a skeleton within the head um
that has a shared root and then that
actually extends into um as the base
skeleton um then we just deal with it as
a as a normal character so what's tricky
about that is that we've got to figure
out a way and and and we've worked on it
quite a bit uh last week before Evo uh
went on holidays um to rebuild that
physic skeleton without completely
rebuilding it because it's one of the
things that takes the longest time on
the on the CPU and then thus to be um uh
synchronized to all the players so uh
yeah that's kind of what we're working
on within there uh we want that driven
ragal to be affected we want um as we
add different skeleton extensions on to
extend the skeleton physically as well
there's just so much to think about I
mean you know you're one physics
environment then when you enter a ship
you enter another physics environment
right then what happens if you're ragd
doing from one physics environment into
the next physics environment and then
you betweene back into your regular
animation right so exactly there just so
much to the relative space of that moves
so often like we have a world space then
we have the local grid space then we
have a Zone space um so yeah there's a
lot of transitioning between different
uh we call them partitioning grids right
it's just so cool though yep all right
uh next question the uh Orion mining
ship has a large laser for dissecting
asteroids into smaller chunks everyone's
I mean mining is just super cool
dissecting asteroids that's a good way
to put it dissect cuz you're like
getting getting inside how do you
implement a continuous beam weapon like
that is it mostly animation while using
a ultra high rate of fire and ultra low
DPS or is it an actual beam uh this is
actually a really really good question
and this um this comes up a lot in games
actually when you're going to have
something like a like a P laser that's
that's really just a glorified machine
gun or if you have a beam laser weapon
and as everybody knows we don't really
have a beam weapon uh within Star
Citizen yet um we solved this problem on
an earlier project that I had worked on
a little modic project called Mech warar
Living Legends um we had um they weren't
they weren't continuous beams but they
were they were there for quite some time
so the problems you've got to solve um
is not necessarily having having a long
beam because we have different levels of
casting that we can do but continuous
segments where you know where to break
the beam so you know where it stops when
a ray cast we got to we've got to show
it somehow right it's got to we've got
to be able to one author the geometry so
it looks good um and then second we've
got to be able to uh change the length
of that geometry now does it make sense
to have one piece of geometry that just
draws until two km long well think of
the bounding box of something like this
right so that's going to call out as
soon as you look away and things like
that so that doesn't really work out
well so what we did on the mear project
was we actually had little segments just
kep stacking on top throughout and then
stack on top but then you've got other
problems with that um that comes to do
with draw calls so you've got one object
two draw calls another object two draw
two objects another draw call and if
you've got 2,000 or something yeah what
happens exactly so the best way to do
something like this is not necessarily
to have like a uh uh uh like a really a
continuous rate of fire um is to do that
Ray cast you do that Ray check um every
couple second every every couple
milliseconds anyways not every frame um
because there's no reason really to do
it every frame um but to actually extend
those verts you control the verts on the
effect itself so that it does the exact
same length of that Ray and then you
grab those few verts and you move it
back move it forward move back kind of
Arty how our projectile system works
currently for those that don't know in
the original trailer I made a bunch of
particle effects and then and I gave
them damage and they physics and all
that stuff but once we actually um you
know came out Arena commander and needed
a more sophisticated solution to support
you know networking and all this stuff
right uh we actually decided to switch
from just a a particle effect over to a
cylinder a capsule right and then that
capsule would draw and Shrink depending
on you know its velocity and all these
all these effects and then we would
attach it a particle effect on top of
that including uh with an additional
glow Shader so we rendered the capsule
as this type of glow which we have all
these Shader effects on it and then we
could also attach a particle effect on
top of that for additional effects and
then the verts actually can move and
stuff so
um that's going to be a super fun uh
it's going to be NE looking forward and
actually what's really cool is that
we've already got all the all the um uh
the actual weapon fire the weapon type
uh we've got that all in place all the
code in place it's just really a matter
of having the visuals uh that that that
come alongside it um you know there'll
be cool things like um when we have um
um scrap or U when you're trying to
actually pull out you know minerals and
things like that from a ship uh when
you're trying to get uh we're calling it
scrap I think or something like this um
but we're going to need a beam weapon
for that we're going to need some sort
of beam uh for repair we're going to
need some sort of Beam for mining um uh
so we need these beams anyways and again
the the game code is pretty much done
for that we just need uh we just need a
nice effect um so that's kind of next
upep for some of the VFX guys all right
yeah so that's going to be uh I'm
looking forward to seeing what the the
team comes up with that one cuz uh we're
getting close I think yeah definitely
will planets uh oh was a good one will
planets have variant biomes and or
weather regions or will each planet be
uniform do you think current procedural
Tech will be capable of generating Flora
which is like plants right uh and Faun
which is animals living living things at
a Fidelity close enough to Art you are
producing that's a great question so
there's actually two questions within
here right so the first one that I want
to I want to deal with is Will planets
have VAR B
of course we have to I mean otherwise
you're going to end up with planets that
all look rocky planets that all look
Frozen planets that all look and we've
got some of the best um um atmosphere
technology that I've ever seen um it's
it's it's absolutely phenomenal um we've
got uh I don't know how much we're we're
talking about this yet but we've solved
all kinds of lighting um uh challenges
let's say so things like GI on the
planets um there's a there's there's
there's some good Solutions already in
place so I don't see any reason why we
wouldn't have variant biomes um now if
he's talking about variant biomes within
the planet itself so you've got a planet
up north is going to be the polar ice
caps on the south is is going to be
polar ice caps but in the middle does it
get like absolutely there's no reason
why we can't do this weather regions is
a bit of a different story um that's a
lot harder because um sure we can do all
all levels of code we know where you are
on the planet we know what sector you're
in um um what's around you but how do we
communicate that over to the player and
how deep do you go with the design you
have it where when you go to that
location it's always raining or do you
do it where there's actually some kind
of weather happening I mean so I think
there's a lot of uh things to solve with
the with the weather give you an idea
these are the things we're thinking
about so the Fidelity of our planets are
going to be such that you've not seen
this before um there's no question
absolutely I'm now whether you have
moving weather and things like that on
it it's a problem that we're not yet
ready to to solve and they're already
taking a look at it so things like U
volumetric clouds and all this kind of
stuff um but to have moving weather
patterns and things like that within the
planets uh that'll be something for
another time I think um but I do think
that that's going to be one of the one
of the pieces we want to do um I I think
it'll be amazing so the second piece of
this question is
um do I think that the current
procedural Tech will be capable of
generating the Flor and fauna at the
Fidelity that we are um yeah absolutely
that's the goal the art is still making
the asset so the Fidelity will be
it's just a matter of this procedural
Tech deciding to poate the plants and
the animals right but I don't see any
reason that we can't have the same
visual Fidelity that we have for the
rest of the game and and that's that's
the drive that's the direction right and
and all of us had worked on we've all
worked on uh you know little levels that
have been hand authored so much and our
goal with this whole system is to be
able to make an entire world at that
same level of fidelity right um we want
to have um you know trees that look like
Crisis we want to have we want to have
um um animals and things like that
within them um absolutely we want them
to be at that exact same Fidelity and do
I think it's possible absolutely with
most of the stuff that we've seen in the
last little while absolutely just have
to be smart about how you author your
art and as long as you go for you know a
very technical practical approach and
optimized approach I think uh it's
really quite no and that's it and to be
honest too U the other thing with it is
that you know generating um um forests
trees uh even animals and things like
that and getting them all placed on the
planet is difficult yes but there's
harder types of planets to do one of the
more one of the more difficult and
you've worked on things around this um
is like a procedural City type Planet so
what what then do we do and how do we
keep that Fidelity for a planet that's
covered in an entire city um that's a
lot trickier um I think anyways yeah
well you know it's just AAG you make
everything as modulars possible and then
you could you know who knows what you
can do right exactly um with the right
gameplay code so I hope that answer the
question I know we're being a bit obtuse
um but it's only because we
haven't yeah yeah and they're all you
know they're happening it's it's it's
all a moving product um all right now
we're going to get to a more difficult
uh question and a long one so stay with
me with localized physics grids being in
the game have you considered using them
uh for more unorthodox means oh that's
cool for example spaceships are stations
with varing directions of gravity all of
a sudden I think A Space Odyssey you
know when you're like the EXA um I'd be
thinking of something like circular
space stations or space stations where
the ground just continues up a wall uh
Inception style or spaceships where one
uh one deck and uh the direction of
gravity would Point outwards so the hall
would act as the floor how cool would it
be to look up and see people hanging
from the ceiling doing their normal
business speaking of circular gravity
are planets going to be basically
enormous localized physics grids or is
there more to them if so can you explain
a bit about how they are going to work
in that regard all right so these guys
are always sneaking two questions in
aren't they there's always like a
there's there's like a main one oh but
by the way 20 for theed Planet something
right well it's such a co question and
you can see why it spawns more questions
yeah I'm super happy uh um that
everybody's so into into the planets
because that's going to be such a huge
unique point to Star Citizen anyways um
so the first question question really is
about localized physics grids and using
them in a more unorthodox way uh we've
done this internally a lot actually uh
you can have a lot of fun with the
physics grids um doing a circular space
station is very much possible um so that
way you can have a localized direction
of gravity all throughout the localized
physics grid which is quite cool the
other thing again this is something that
Chris Rain had worked a lot on um is
that we've got a sparse voxal
representation of the physics grid
meaning uh we can shape it how we want
um so we do give we we give the system a
model gets as close as possible to this
particular piece of geometry now uh the
higher poy that geometry is the more
expensive uh the more difficult that
check is to make um but absolutely we've
done this kind of stuff internally we've
even messed with uh you know magnetic
boots grab boots y so so and I think we
actually took them out of the build for
a little while just because the
animations look so weird on them um but
we'll be putting those right back in so
not only will you have the localized
physics rate of say just like he's
talking about like a like a circular
space station or something like this but
you'll also be able to uh uh
magnetically connect yourself via your
mag boots or whatever which is probably
super helpful on the outside of the ship
right to get around especially for the
bigger ships sure totally um and it's
also kind of fun I mean it's it's a neat
thing to mess around with just like he
says you know somebody's just going
about their day-to-day business and
they're hanging upside down from you or
something like this um but yeah that
technology lets us do all that all this
kind of work um and then speaking of
circular gravities are planets going to
be basically enormous localized physical
grids or is there a lot is there
something more to them there's a lot
more um to the planets one of the one of
the tricky Parts again um and I think I
talked about this in another tend for
the developers is that we can't possibly
store every single um um piece of
physics Collision on the server all the
time right so this is something that
we've got to generate at at on the
client side at runtime somehow um so
they're not big physics grids
essentially um they've got to
have they they have their own gravity
it's completely implemented
independently of a physics grid uses the
same concept I suppose uh but it's not a
physics grid um entirely it' be far too
large um and uh yeah it's not even close
to as granular as as what we it's
different than what when you enter a
ship for example right where you set up
your your box it's very very different
and again like if you think about it
right you've got a you've got a very
different shape you've got a sphere and
everything's got to be a a local gravity
to to the center of the sphere whereas
in a local physics
or you
can and then everything is just going
that direction but uh yeah it's a little
bit more difficult to do on a uh on a
planetary scale but it's not a big
physics grid um it's a it's a lot it's
and not to not to be condescending at
all it's a lot more complicated
unfortunately than that um I wish it was
easy is enough as just making a big
physics grid um but that wouldn't really
work for what we need definitely not all
right um what sort of navigation can we
expect for planets Maps GPS beacons uh
and that's asked by armored uh citizen
um that's a cool name I'd imagine
probably all the above right yeah we're
going to need all the above like um and
I consider sort of maps and GPS kind of
the same sort of thing GPS is just a
function within a map yeah right so it's
just telling you where you are within
these Maps uh beacons absolutely so so
you guys get an idea we're working on
all the gameplay related to this so the
first step of that gameplay and it's
something that I showed in the
procedural planic Tech demo um is the
approach I mean uh if if Landing is
going to take you 30 35 minutes uh
because I mean we looked up how long an
actual transition between uh for Earth
Landings right how long atmosphere to
ground really takes and it takes a long
time um if if we make it take that exact
same amount of time oh you're going to
land one time and you'll never do it
again over um there'll be you just
you're going to need half an hour of
gameplay just to get down to the planet
surface so that do really work out so
one of the things that we're working on
is is the Quantum travel beacons uh
where you end up with uh where you end
up close to the planet enough that you
can land within a reasonable amount of
time how many beacons we put on whether
that's automatic whether you whether you
manually do this all yourself since it's
all completely seamless of course we
want it to be manual but we also don't
want it to take so long to do that
you'll never want a hind to your
gameplay right exactly so then once you
get on the planet right we need some
level of um where are you I mean Global
M isn't that the hardest thing is it's
huge and even when you're working on it
you get lost sometimes and I put my own
in there sometimes I'm just put around
right so we're going to need uh all
these um and we've talked a lot about
this and really what it's going to come
down to is really our first gameplay
implementation of all of it uh which has
happening as we speak so uh this is
something that we're working on
internally I don't know when you're
going to see it um but we're basically
solving all these problems right now
like as simple as okay you're in zero g
with your ship you've transitioned now
into gravity where the have local
gravity now and you've got physics and
everything so how does the ship flight
change how does it feel right is it fun
um that's really what matters so once we
get there then we'll be giving you your
Maps GPS's beacons all over the planet
things like this so I expect that you'll
have that your map changes too cuz you
go from space which is there is no
ground to yeah and it's all 3D uh it's
like a 3D map to to needing some have a
horizon to where I am yeah exactly so
cool all right next question which
upcoming feature gives you the biggest
headache so far which will probably be
the hardest nut to crack except the new
except the new item system are you
serious put the guy knew the guy knew
he's like they're going to answer it
it's the new item system I mean it's so
I wonder is the guy's name Drew or drug
or du D Dr Dr Dru Dru Dru I don't know I
could barely read awful um okay so which
uh features Beyond item Port because the
item Port one is really tricky and yeah
I'm trying to answer with item Port
right well I'm just going to go ahead
and do it uh it's the item Port system
and we can go into other the new but I
want to talk about it anyways because it
is the biggest headache so far because
we're working on it all the time and
you're working on it constantly so the
biggest thing that we're deing with
right now is all the characters for
example are going through a major
transitional phase they're going from
what uh krych used as cdfs which is a
type of uh XML where you tie all your
items together into a uh sophisticated
item support system and you've currently
been working with the engineers on
building this tool and uh so now we're
going to be able to build uh characters
as items uh with this new um item Port
system which is super helpful but at the
same time it's difficult because you're
trying to support everything that
previously existed because you don't
want to break everything for design and
cinematics but yet you want to push
forward and use the new tech so like
there's it's kind of difficult to
support both you do have to make the
transition right it's one of those
Infamous problems where where you've
done everything right when you have
exactly what you start started with with
which seems to make no sense so like
visually right um and and and and Forest
Nails the hits the nail right on the
head with this one um again the the the
CDF setup was was great for krych um
it's it's really hard to maintain you
know hundreds of characters with that
sort of system the the other thing that
didn't work for us on a on a on a coding
side on a programming side is that the
um every independent uh piece of the
character actually needs some sort of
component code to go with it and it
needs persistence right and it needs
persistence exactly so um because of the
new item uh layout uh we can actually
have different code running on different
functions running on different um pieces
of the of the character itself rather
than you being one character as a whole
you're actually a collection of a a lot
of different uh gameplay components that
are being updated uh differently than
than other things so we kind of didn't
really answer his question except the
new item system so beyond the new item
system what else kind of hurts us like
the character one is though um I would
honestly say just the full scale um
because we're doing the full scale uh
solar systems now um and that's
something that I really think is going
to end up out to the community uh sooner
rather than later um is the full sizee
solar system itself um I think that's
going to be the the hardest nut to crack
um we've already got all the support in
it but it's all the extraneous stuff
that we haven't thought of yet or we
haven't even seen um so we've got QA
starting to run it through these full
scales tests and then not only will we
have full scale but likely at somewhat I
I don't know if it's going to be the
same time but I'd like to see this
happen kind of all together is we put
one of the procedural planets within
there now I call it procedural it's
going to be like the designer control
Planet so we put one of the planets in
to the full solar scale the full solar
system scale Call It Whatever um and
then we see all the problems that that
brings right and we've got to start
we're combining fixing these full
systems or full solar systems with
procedural planets with the player
customization and and the back end right
that persistence so your your character
is your character you know going forward
um and all these things comeing together
once which are all 100% necessary for
this project but how awesome will that
be because that how great is it going to
be cuz that's really we've done so much
of the of you know of the development
for art and the content and sure and
we're always do all this stuff a smaller
scale version right smaller scale this
is this is finally this is what brings
it together right all takes all these
things we working on the last couple
years and finally exactly puts those
final pieces together so it's super
excited but we like anything we know
it's not going to be easy it it will be
a headache and it will be difficult but
we will achieve it and it will and it
will um it will be conquered and it will
be awesome um but you know there will be
problems uh yeah but you guys will seen
this sooner rather than later for sure
yeah cuz we're doing the testing now
yeah we're doing the testing now awesome
um any chance you could how did they
know about the new item system I want to
ask I'm going to ask you first I bet you
Chris talks about it all the time you
think this one of our Turtle plays asked
this question just to mess with us oh
you think so maybe I would think so
probably ex here's another internal
question potentially no I'm just joking
this one was by
Solas
Solas um any chance you can give an
update on the female model what has
caused him to be held up for so long
after the male model was released what
are the current issues that stop the
models from being available in the verse
so I can blame all kinds of departments
if you want I mean I mean Steve will be
super happy so Steve Bender right now is
in Frankfurt you know my partner in
crime there we all we all have a office
that it's all sort of shared so I'm
going to blame Steve on this one I'm
going to say that animation is behind no
um and that's not really the problem
actually we've had there's a lot of
hurdles a couple different things on the
mesh which I'll let Forest answer but on
the uh on the animation techn ology sort
of side uh what we really want is a
completely finished mail um and and that
doesn't mean mesh that doesn't mean
necessarily uh um uh like outfits and
things like this what it means is
everything to do with animation so um
we've got most of it right we've got
lots of firsters stuff holding weapons
we've got cover we've finally now got
mantling and vating so basically one's
mantling vating cover Locomotion ships
uh what else am I missing I'm missing
something and AI sort of interactions
anyways once those are all done for the
mail then we can basically just plug a
female into it um there's a there's a
there's a technical implementation side
of this where um we actually have to
plug the whole bunch of stuff within
mannequin if any of the asset names are
different between a male and a female
and sometimes we've done this uh that's
going to cause a problem within
mannequin but we actually want to use
the exact same logic that a male does to
the female cuz we don't want to be
fixing two different bugs
and here's the thing right we yeah
exactly we don't want to make the same
mistake twice and we don't want to make
the same mistake in parallel with each
other and that's it so uh the one thing
that we are doing is we are figuring out
every single thing that goes right and
goes wrong and figuring out our complete
process and then uh taking the female
character and having a much smoother
transition and making sure that
everything works properly with
everything we've learned from the the m
exctly and then that way a female
implementation is easy um it does
doesn't take us nearly as much time
because a lot of it is oh how do we do
the mail okay let's do it the same oh
how do we do the mail okay let's do it
the same so that's what's going to solve
all our problems for that uh the other
thing that this gives us a huge benefit
for is the vuel it's going to be the
exact same process um so once that male
is completely locked down U for the
Squad 42 aspect of it vaulting manling
all the animation then
females you know it's it's not done but
um we've got all the assets it's just a
matter of plugging it in yeah and uh you
know we we're still doing some Polish to
the actual female uh herself the body
you know that's you know we want to make
sure that that corre 4K nether region
texture map really oh never Outsource
that was an interesting never Outsource
characters yeah if you Outsource
characters just be prepared to get stuff
back you never know what you're going to
get expecting they don't want me to talk
about it but a 4K nether region I think
you can figure out what that means 4K
texture for that I just don't get
it um and then there's the obviously you
know you know the rigs and everything
that you got to solve so yes um but the
the female model is is coming along and
I'm personally very excited to have it
cuz we've already had some clothing made
for it and we want to get that um and I
think that's going to you know kind of
fall into the customization too we had
to figure out how the players are going
to uh be able to customize themselves
with all their items and stuff and uh
the Mel had a series of clothes already
so we're were able to tackle that
challenge and figure it out and uh now
we can move on to the female so I'm
super excited that is coming very soon
right and just to give you a you know uh
a full sort of a look on this um you
know the females uh we've already got
them locomoting around uh we've got a
bunch within Squadron 42 that are that
are that are specific to Squadron 42 so
they all work um it's just a matter of
you not having seen them within the
persistent Universe yet because when we
give them to you we want to have the
customization like you said we want to
have all the same outfits as the male we
basically don't want to take anything
away from the female right and then
there's the whole you know we have all
our heads right so we've been solving
you know you have your body but then you
have these head scans how do the head
scans fit on the body you have to match
up the topology the skin the skin tone
which is a whole which is a challenge so
there's just a lot of things and you
know we're trying to do it one step at a
time and make sure that we don't make
the you know same mistake twice sure and
as efficient as possible yeah when they
come online you know uh they'll be fully
featured so we won't just kind of build
them up slowly it just be all at once
yeah exactly all right will there be
barber shops in game or places to alter
our character's appearance for aesthetic
purposes or in a ex an expanded capacity
a not so legal purpose that sounds
Shady so legal purpose so is that like
change your appearance so you can get
away with a crime yeah right or is that
like you
know I don't know I think that there
will be I we've been working a lot on
hair uh you know recently that's that's
been a big topic because no matter how
great your head scans look you still
need hair right and that's well that's
our biggest problem right the current
hair
that we had worked on and even some of
the tech we're fighting with a bit um is
is that's what's bringing not down but
uh lowering the quality yeah I mean
Bringing Down the heads a little bit
right you take a look at the head you
take a look at the the the face texture
we've got of the crazy wrinkles we've
got por mapping we've got all this crazy
stuff um and then you've kind of got
hair which is
has on it maybe some directional maps
that uh just can't you know you know
there's a lot of elements still missing
right you know get that nice Rim
lighting you know I'm sure we've all
seen the Paragon demo where they have
all the hair strands well they got this
awesome spline stuff that looks just
amazing I love I love to look one of
those things you always want you know
all this Tech but you know you still
have to uh commit to um where you're at
and work with the tools that you have
right and then to get it done and then
you know further down the road map you
can always try to you know stay on top
of um what everybody else is doing and
and um you know keep to the same uh
technical standards that the visual
standards really right I mean we've got
to be up um and you know we've got to be
one of the best games out there and uh
we don't want to give you any old
technology kind of the thing and we
don't want to we don't want to make the
the the faces that we spent so so long
on right look look worse um so the
actual question is is you know are there
going to be barber shops that's a design
question I have no idea about barber
shops what I do know is that you'll be
modifying your face uh in a medical
facility of some sort right yeah like
reconstructive surgery exactly so
whether whether you're doing your hair
at the same time uh that's a great
question probably I would guess I would
imagine anything like you know that has
to do with the head with with your face
so facial hair or whatever else so I
guess you have to get plastic surgery to
shave maybe fair enough I mean yeah we
are in La kind of pretty normal um but
there there's a lot of problems to solve
uh with the hair like uh like forest was
saying um even down to just having
different head sizes I mean all the
heads are a different size so how do you
stop yourself from making every single
um haircut for every single head so if I
have one haircut made for one head but
obviously when you are customizing your
character you're going to want to have
access to all the different hair but
what if you chose MPC shaped head n as
opposed to MPC head 55 or even if you've
controlled it through a modifier or
something or a blend shape whatever we
end up doing how do you make sure that
the hair stays attached to the head when
the head changes size that's the thing
um and and those are those are those are
problems that we're solving and to give
you an idea of that particular one uh
how we want to do this is that we have a
we have an actual Scout Map we hold all
the morph targets for every single head
within the scal map or we keep offsets
of every single joint that we need to
offset when we're customizing the face
so that we actually only make one model
that contains all the morph targets for
every single head uh and then the hair
cards on top of that um those are going
to have to move around and we've kind of
started playing around with it right
like we we realized very early you know
eyelashes for example right you make
eyelashes and you're like wait a minute
everyone has a slightly different size
socket for you know in the head right so
how do you make you can't just make we
have 120 heads you can't just make one
set of eyelashes to fit all the eye
shapes right so all of a sudden you got
to figure out that's where our technical
animators come in yeah and you know the
technical art team we've got a really
awesome technical art team and one of
the one of the things that our team is
the best at um and I you know I say this
and I'm super proud of the guys for
being able to always do this is these
massive script updates that will affect
all the assets together so one of the
hardest things about this game is the
sheer scope of it right like how many
heads we've got we got over 100 heads
how many character bodies we got we've
got hundreds of these um you can't go in
manually open up Maya tweak one close it
save there's too much you open up my
closet safe it would take you all year
um but we've got guys like Mark McCall
John rigs Gage um uh matat TR writing
scripts that that are that are a batch
uh that are a batch process to it so to
give you an example Mark McCall made the
eyelashes right so one thing we don't
get delivered eyelashes with the faces
it's a problem because they look pretty
funny without eyelashes um especially
the females right so what he's done is
he has actually got a script that builds
the eyelash geometry not only does it
build the eyelash geometry but it checks
the head that it's working on builds the
geometry skins it on exports the process
puts it into a CDF and it's done that's
how you manage right CU you want to have
your artist spend the time on and
eyelashes because if you could have them
spend time on one eyelash they're going
to look really good if they have to
spend their time on 120 eyelashes you're
going to have a very low quality right
set of ey and you're going to have an
artist that's going to want and we have
this visual bar so yeah totally so you
want to you want to have you know
artists concentrate on single elements
and then you have your technical artists
populate those single elements in a very
smart approach to save the labor time so
we can concentrate on the visual
Fidelity and not the uh the art labor
actual labor labor itself right sure but
this is where bugs come from so to give
you guys an idea asset bugs this is
usually what happens so like you'll do a
batch process like this you'll check you
have to spot check a whole bunch of them
you'll maybe have QA check every single
one of them uh but you'll spot check a
couple and then there'll be one that
didn't work correctly or uh one that you
know somebody's PC lagged out for half a
second or whatever I mean um this is
where the asset bugs come from it's not
like somebody was sitting there they
looked at it it's you know whatever the
faces exploded and they're like yeah
that's good you know and exported it
it's usually something that somebody
hasn't actually physically touched yeah
yeah totally all right cool uh we got
one more question by Fallon just curious
about how procedural generation more
procedural Planet question and I love
that will work on planets with large
bodies of waters oceans and how will
that affect performance is it hard to
render so much water or easier on the
side of the player also space Wells
excellent question
the space Wells but I do know working
with oceans in the past it is Shader
driven so I think that it is uh
achievable with without killing
performance yeah absolutely and um again
um the Carson wiel is one of the U I
mean he's he's he's unsung uh he's very
quiet um unless he's very angry uh but
he's written he's written white papers
for the engine he was there from the
gecko and he's actually working within
this he's actually training uh one of
the one of our Junior Graphics
programmers to do this particular
Implement implementation so him and a a
gentleman by the name of Thiago who went
to ID software I believe and worked on
the worked on Doom um worked on our
oceans originally within the cry engine
right and I I I think I can go out on a
limb and say the oceans within the cry
engine were one of the biggest the best
features within the engine it looked the
best we had scattering through the waves
all this crazy stuff that that
eventually you know go under water the
volumetrics oh so I think you can um
expect at least that level of fidelity
um but what's tricky again about water
is how um uh first of all the Highlight
changes at a distance so when you're
approaching a planet the water's got to
got to highlight it's got to it's got to
react very different specularity wise to
the actual surface of is just exactly um
then when you get up close right you
want to see waves but you don't want to
see it tiling everywhere right um so
we've got this real big scale problem
that we're going to have to deal with
damic desolation on the stuff um being
able to have displaced waves and things
like this and then additionally if we
want to go under the water which a ship
to design should be able to do right
let's hope that design says that ships
are submarines also to me to me if a
ship can go into outer space it can go
under freaking water right I think it
should be able to go under water but
whatever I mean we'll we'll see where
that goes with the design that's a
design thing um but I think that should
happen I'm going to get back to my desk
if you go underwater space I'm going to
have a task to get back to my desk to
make sure that the jetpack is uh
supports underwater as well oh oh that's
a good point right and then oh wow
because I mean what a Pandora's box
right because you get under and it's
like you open the back of the cutless
what happens right shouldn't water flow
in right but is a local physics rid like
like pushing water out I don't know
there's all sorts of crazy suine though
is is built to withstand the extreme
weight and pressure that the water puts
on and I don't think that a ship needs
to withstand that same amount of
pressure in out of space yeah I'm not
sure wouldn't you think that a missile
hitting the side of your ship has a lot
of pressure feel like
a blows it up right I don't know anyways
I don't know so whether or not you go
under waterer I don't know ABS did it to
the Enterprise I think it was kind of
dumb what what put it underwater yeah I
think that was fine it's got Shields are
you talking about Voyager home yeah no
the one where uh uh isn't Voyager home
it's underwater no no yeah that's shot
that's shot when he's coming out of the
water the new the new Star J did with
the enterpris hiding under water yeah
and then it comes out of it and yeah it
was cool but it didn't make any sense um
but it didn't make any sense fair enough
um sorry so can chips go underwater if
the Enterprise can do it I'll show you
yeah right and again this will be a
design debate and as you see there's a
couple different couple different
mindsets I'm sure all the players are
going to go yeah absolutely they need to
go underwater right CU other people be
like no finish the game n we can do like
hunt for ated October things one ping
only I'm more interested in the space
Wells personally yeah and the space
Wells right um we talked a little bit
earlier in a different different
question about fauna anyways so space
whales Mega fauna I think we're going to
have to support something like this
right um whether it's whether it's
whales or big big things on the on the
on the ground uh walking around yeah
sure space whales do it you heard it
here so so that put pretty much like
pushes CH you want to hear my my uh
space well joke yeah I do so a space
well walks into a bar and he sits down
to against next to another space wall
yeah and the the space wall
goes okay and then the Spaceball looks
over he goes man you are
wasted you're wasted all right thank you
for to another episode of 10 for the
developers Sean Tracy for Stefan um we'd
like to thank the uh subscribers uh over
and over and over again because we love
you and again without you we would not
be here so thank you so much for
everything and your contributions and
we're going to get back to work and keep
making this game for you hell yeah we'll
get the females done right now let's go
do it and the space wealth thank you so
much all right thank you thanks guys
