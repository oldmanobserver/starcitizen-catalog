Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome back
to BugSmasher [Cough]...
Wow that was bad.
Alright.
Hey everyone, we’re here in my fancy dancy
test level with physics debug on.
I’ve got a fun little bug that I supposively
broke the physics when items such as this
gun down here gets attached to ships.
As you can see, all the little grey stuff,
that’s all the physics meshes and on the
weapons and landing gear it’s not working.
Yay!
So the reason why, I was told this was my
bug was we started, I should say, we started
splitting up a lot of our entity logic into
these things called components.
Originally with CryEngine you really just
had an entity and then something called a
game object extension and you have like all
your logic in there and if you wanted to do
the same thing in another entity over another,
you usually copy and pasted it because that’s
just how the engine was.
Now we have this component system where we
can build this little bit of logic here that
can be used by this entity, this entity, this
entity, any entity we want.
So we had our vehicles and our old items,
they had a special way of physicalizing or
getting physics and doing you know, becoming
a rigid body moving around and about.
However, I had to convert those over to our
new physics controller which will handle that
for anything uses it, but it also allows other
components to directly read the physics information
and we needed that for the interaction system
and especially for 2.4.
So that way we could query, we call them interactions
so that you could select certain things, but
that’s for a future thing.
For now I needed to convert everything over
to a physics controller and that will handle
all the physics the same for every entity
that uses it and unfortunately..
[Cell phone rings]
Phone call.
Seriously business.
So unfortunately after I checked all it in,
thought everything was working, I get a fun
call from Andrew our QA and he has the most
evil laugh there is and as soon as I checked
in the code he was like, “Hey I have this
bug” and I’m like, “Of course you do”.
So here’s our good old weapon and here’s
our good old ship.
Normally the weapon will have its own physics,
but when we attach it to something it actually
becomes physics of the ship.
So the physics controller actually handles
that, so when you’re on your own and then
when you get attached, it makes sure it goes
through the appropriate areas.
Unfortunately it had nothing to do with my
specific physics controller, it actually had
to do something else which is an attachable
component and for the longest time we had
special code for things you attach to item
ports, but because we want to be more generic
and we want to attach anything to an item
port, we created this thing called an attachable
component.
If an entity has this, it could basically
attach to things.
So now we could have ships attached to item
ports and a hangar, we could have players
attached to an item port in a vehicle, you
could have a clothing thing attached to an
item port on a ship, you name it and unfortunately
this attachable object expects another component
called geometry resource which is another
component which handles all the asset creation
for how it looks.
So you have a CGA which is our ship which
has bones and stuff so it can animate or it
could be a pure geometry or skin, but either
way geometry resource is the component to
handle that and unfortunately, since I made
the item and the vehicle have a physical controller
so it can use the interaction system, it also
now has this attachable component.
This area right here, get these flags, we
search for it… do do do..
So when an attachable component gets attached
onto the ship or hangar, whatever and there’s
a thing called an attachment, we set certain
flags and if there’s no flags set like it’s
not visible, then we actually clear the physics
because you can see it, why have physics,
it just saves on performance.
This is for things like you’re very far
away you can really see or if we hide an entity
you don’t want to crash into a random thing
and unfortunately it’s returning no visibility
and since our item vehicle aren’t using
this component yet, we’re always getting
zero because this would be null.
So what I did is used the fault visibility
and what this says if we’re in third person,
first person, or doing the shadow pass this
thing is visible, it should have physics.
So now if I compile this bad boy, recode…
Hope into the game, once recodes done its
thing.
Aha!
Recode!
So we don’t have physics yet, but once I
go to AI physics mode, BAM!
Look at that, physics, right there and right
here.
Oh snap, because it’s visible we have physics.
If we move this guy away so he can animate
or fall down, you can see that the physics
moved with it.
Wooo, having fun with physics.
So as you can see we had a fun little problem
when we’re trying to componentize our logic
and when I added that physics controller and
interaction thing, we had no physics so when
I got a bug, everyone thought it was that
big whole change because I sent out an email.
Turns out it was something completely different,
but it was still related to a component and
all it was just the fault flags getting missed
because we didn’t have a certain component
vehicle item.
So that got resolved and everything's going
good and we’re going to continue splitting
all of our logic into these sub components
so that you can have a generic entity and
slap on whatever kind of logic you want.
The other benefit of our components is going
to be the ability to multithread all of our
updates which is huge especially since we
want hundreds if not thousands of players
on a server.
You don’t want to update the people far
over there, but you want to update the people
close by, so you have to be able to decide
who gets what updates, when, how and maybe
we could update them all at one time.
So componentizing everything, good thing,
just makes the game faster, makes the game
awesome, hope you guys enjoyed.
See you next time.
