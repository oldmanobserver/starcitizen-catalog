hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers uh
today I'm going to show you an awesome
bug so let's get
started bug
smashes hey everyone we are here in
Port alisar I really want to say
Alistar but we're in alisar alir we're
in a port so here in our fancy Dancy
Port um we were tracking down some fun
bugs in two three where the server after
a while just goes completely Bonkers has
low FPS and players get weird things
like when you Tap a button maybe you
don't start shooting because um the
servers are you know taking a their
sweet time we are here in this fun
little Port alar map and we as we were
debugging to figure out why the servers
were you know having such low FPS we
discovered two horrible horrible things
one uh ships that get spawned in by
players and destroyed outside of the
green zone weren't getting cleaned up
and they were still there in the levels
and the same thing was happening with
items so we fixed the issue with the
ships no longer um you know or I should
say ship's always getting stuck there in
the level and now they get properly
cleaned up but we noticed something um
where our items would actually stick
around and on the screen you actually
see um all the items that are currently
in the level and how many instances so
we have a couple ammo crates a couple
pistols and a couple repair beams um
this is a fresh map um I'm the only
player inside and these are the items
that just so happen to be there because
the designer add of them but if we spawn
a fun little
ship uh spawn on a hornet oops I have
debugging
on uh you'll see that a bunch of items
just appeared on the list cool uh let's
go to where is my ship let's go to my
ship I'm going to go through all the
levels because I don't feel like
walking
I am going to now enter my
ship and I'm going to blow it
up so this might take a little bit to
kill
myself I'm turning on my
ship
and Bam all right
so
now once the HUD
initializes I am going to destroy my fun
little
ship so I blew up my ship and on the top
you'll see that um it says my Hornet CU
it's telling me that it's destroyed and
as you can see the items are all still
there so if we wait a moment there it
goes the ship went away and if you
notice not all of our items
disappeared um we still have our debris
piece which has some ammo boxes our
radar and our laser
guns so we're going to wait for the
debris let's
see so we still have some debris it's
takes about 60 seconds for it to go
away so wait for it to go
bye-bye we still have eight instances oh
all the debris pieces just vanished and
if you noticed we still have all of
these HUD items on the bottom we have
Let's see we have some counter measures
we have a radar we have missiles we have
the
self-destruct um some thrusters and some
weapons
not good so basically if you spawn a
bunch of ships and they all die and we
take our items and attach it to our
debris they never get cleaned up so
after a while of playing you we build up
these items and these items and these
items and that's a lot of crap and
unfortunately they get stacked so
much um they become a burden on the
networking and even on client and server
performance so what's happening
we go to our lovely debris item um way
back
when uh when our debris or I should say
what our debris item is is anytime you
smack into something or your wiing
breaks off we take the geometry of the
vehicle Stick it to this U entity called
a vehicle item de breze and we attach
all the weapons and gizmos and stuff
onto that item and that controls the
geometry and all the it items from then
forth uh it used to be that this was all
client side so when it got cleaned up um
we just hid the you know the item on it
because the server still own the item
and it would get deleted when the ship
get deleted because the item was still
technically attached to the ship we just
kind of did some magic to put it onto
the debris piece however as time went on
we were slowly moving this debris piece
over to be server and client so client
versions would just have geometry server
versions would have the actual items and
when we actually move the items over now
the debris item would own the item and
no longer the vehicle so if the vehicle
went away the debris piece owned the
item if it went away and never deleted
up its items you would still have all
these items that you see in that fun
little list so so all we have to do is
when this debris piece goes away we have
to make sure to clean up all the items
that it owns and that's literally all we
have to do uh it's just one of those
things we forgot to do when we you know
move the debris piece over to server um
uh server control with all these items
on it so what we're going to do is build
again and restart the level and see what
happens
all right so we are back into our lovely
level in the port let's try this
fix uh we shall spawn around another
Hornet and see what
happens still have fly mode where did I
go
there we are
ha all right let's spawn ourselves
another
f7c spawned it and we got a bunch of
items in our list so let's
go smash this Hornet
wooo and while that
happens we are going to
cheat
oops CU 60 seconds is way too long we're
going to delete our debris in 5
seconds all right so recode just
finished and now our debris is set to
for five seconds so let's smash this
ship to
Smither
boom so our ship is still dead up on the
top and all the items from the debris
just went away and once our Hornet goes
bye-bye we should now see
everything go back down yep there we go
so when our vehicle goes away all the
items it owns get removed and now when
our debris pieces get removed all the
items it owns now go away so we're no
longer leaking items and everyone could
have a fun fun day when the 30 Pirates
spawn and they kill them all woo hope
you guys enjoyed hey everyone as you
guys saw we had a little bug with our
items where after you kill a ship and it
spawns debris pieces the debris goes
away the vehicle goes away they all you
know they all get cleaned up but our
items get stuck there so if you have
like a big battle like we have you know
all those pirates spawning those 30 some
Pirates which is another bug uh you know
go and kill them all their items get
stuck and stayed in the level and after
a while they just build up and build up
and build up and the client and server
performance just goes bad so as had to
clean that up fixed it as you can see it
was just a byproduct of us moving the uh
debris from Sir or client authorative to
server authorative so that we could you
know sync what goes to what and you know
you always forget one thing and that one
thing could have some severe
consequences so we figured it out solved
it and on to the next bugs hope you guys
enjoys see you next
time
