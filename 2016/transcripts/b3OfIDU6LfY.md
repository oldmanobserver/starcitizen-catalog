hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers I'm
your host Mark aent I'm a gameplay
programmer here at cig Los Angeles and I
take you behind the scenes of some crazy
bugs and funny bugs that play our game
and it's just a lot of fun to show you
guys what's happening so let's take a
look box
[Music]
species hey everyone we're here in my
fancy dcy test level again and I have a
little Hornet here uh just rotating
freely and as you can see all the
turrets on this guy are just spazzing
out they're just going
bonkers and the funny thing is if um I
actually rotate the turrets they're fine
it's just as soon as you stop rotating
they kind of snap back to the old
position and they're just going crazy uh
so what's happening well uh let's take a
look at the code uh here we are in the
turret code which hasn't been touched in
quite a while and what we do is for all
the axes you know pitch um yaah or even
roll um we want to move uh those bones
to try to aim towards a Target so if we
have a point here we want the turret to
rotate and look at it and if it's down
here you know we want to rotate it there
so uh we have for each of our axis a
current angle and then we have this
thing called the original rotation so if
this is the original rotation and we up
here we move this way so we basically
start here and then from our current
angles we move any which way we need to
go
so that's what this bit of code right
here does and since we're modifying a
joint or a location on a
skeleton um so there's these bones on a
skeleton and that's what you use to move
like my arm there would be a joint here
so I can move it up and down same thing
on a turret there's going to be a joint
for pitch and a joint for um yaw and so
after we do that calculation of how much
we want to move it uh we now have to
tell the skeleton to move to that
location and and this um functionality
right here basically says uh after we're
done animating we're going to inject
this um
rotation so the chir can animate you
know deploy down you know it has
animation maybe deploy down and then as
it deploys um it'll play the animation
for moving up and down and then we'll do
our rotation uh this is some old code
that we've used for a long time and all
of a sudden it decided to break because
in the back end uh for our animations we
there was a lot of um steps to optimize
it um buffer it so that the main thread
could do something while the threaded
thing could do something and then
they're supposed to sink and in between
that time uh this process kind of broke
and the unfortunate thing about this guy
is after the animation has done its
thing on a separate uh thread we then
modify the pose on the main thread so
it's
actually a little bit taxing on the
system now there's this new thing or
this thing that's been supported for a
while just we haven't used it is this
thing called animation pose and what
this thing allows us to do is in the
actual thread that's where we modify the
bones we'll actually apply the rotation
so instead of updating this old Legacy
thing which is now broken uh we have
this uh new thing which we could act
upon uh here it is our our
aim uh pose and we could directly say
all right here's the rotation that we
want so whenever you do the animation
task um in the back or thread will
assign the rotation and it will happen
in the thread so even if this doesn't
happen right away because maybe it's not
visible or maybe it's you know Far Far
Away um whenever it actually gets
processed it will then remember the
value it wanted and then go and process
it so we're going to use this bad boy
now and as you can see here is our
actual implementation where we can
inject position
orientation and
then um whenever uh the thread is
getting ready we basically say all right
we're going to switch over and then once
the thread is in here we generate our
task and compute the actual um rotation
orientation or even both set by the
turret or some other system so let's
activate this guy and disable the old
system now we do want to keep this line
which will allow um the rotation to
happen even if it's not visible that's
mostly for gameplay reasons so if you
can't see the guy behind you you still
want to know which way he's shooting
instead of you know shooting out the
wrong way so this will at least Force um
those locations to be updated all right
so let's hit the magic recode
button that recode is finished before we
go in I just want to show you uh this
little bit because the bones can be
actually on different um characters
because of Legacy reasons we need to
make sure that we only inject this pose
modifier once per frame otherwise things
get funky anyway uh so now we're back in
the game and I can move my turrets all
the way around and if I let go of the
mouse you'll see that they tend tend to
stay in the location that they were last
set except the top uh the turrets and
the bottom turrets they're kinding to
aim at the point that I last
specified because they're trying to aim
um where I am looking on the screen and
as I rotate they tend to rotate as well
but they everything fires okay and
they're not twitching around like crazy
everything's good to go hope you guys
liked it so as you guys saw we had a
little issue where the turrets were
jiggery jagging all around and it was
just because we're using an old outdated
method that wasn't working with our new
streamlined um double buffered um
command system for animations and
because the two systems didn't play well
instead of retrofitting the old system
decided to use the actual new system
which is these things called POS
modifiers which when those animations
happen we can um say that these specific
joints you know arms or these turrets
supposed to be doing some sort of action
or rotation and because of that now when
everything all animates our turrets
rotate nice and smooth they're not doing
that crazy Jitter everything looks
gorgeous and it just looks that much
awesome and we're using the whole new
system in the thread so everything works
out getting a little bit of performance
hope you guys enjoyed until next
time thank you for watching so if you
want to keep it with the latest and
greatest and Star Citizen and the
Squadron 42's development please follow
