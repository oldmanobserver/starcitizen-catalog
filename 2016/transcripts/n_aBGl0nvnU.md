Hey everyone welcome back to BugSmashers.
As you can see I got myself a nice little
haircut and you know why.
I’m preparing myself for the new movie barbershop
three, that fancy cut.
I know it’s nice cut, but I like fancy better.
Hey everyone, we’re here in my fancy dancy
Freelancer.
I can put some posters up here sometime, it’s
a little bit bare, but regardless of that.
We’re checking out a little bug here that
you guys may have saw during the PTU where
when you leave your space and go out into
the world, you’re leaving our little zone
and entering the world zone and during that
transition the player velocity tends to go
insane.
Sometimes it will push you down and you would
instantly die or you’d fly all the way across
the map or the best case scenario which you’ll
probably see here is you’ll stop dead on.
So I’m going to hold down the W key and
as I exit, I immediately stopped.
I can keep flying now, but when I transition
out I stop and then my velocity gets wonky
and as you can see I’m going in a completely
different direction.
If I fly back in, weee…
The same thing will occur.
I should stop, yup I stopped, things get wonky
and now I’m back in the right spot.
So transitioning from our interior grid to
our world grid, there’s some wonkiness going
on and we’re going to take a look at some
of the fixes.
There were quite a few that went into 2.2.
Let me move my fancy dancy game over on the
side and we have here the command buffer.
This is basically the area where all the joints
get updated and the skeleton or the player
skeleton of the bones, they get animated,
they move around and we also have this thing
called the physics location which is the point
where basically the skeleton is.
So the skeleton is here and all the bones
move around.
This little bad boy here updates the physics
position so if I move my bone or if I move
it away, it has to update that and unfortunately
this physics position could be in zone space
or world space because you were transitioning
to and from and it doesn’t handle that very
well.
So Ivo in the Frankfurt office...
let me put back his code, did this little
trick to make sure that the physics position
in this part of the code is always in the
world space.
Basically if we have an owning entity which
will be usually the entity that the skeleton
owns like me the player, we check to see what
zone it’s in and this bad boy right here...
since players are always in the zone, he’s
either in the world zone or the zone of the
ship, it will get the transformation and then
it’ll get the world space transformation
so if our physics position is in the zone
or if it’s in the world space, we have to
make sure we transform that to world space.
So this bad boy will be like, “Alright if
you’re in the zone and doesn’t matter
where you are, we’re going to transform
you into world space”.
So now these physics locations are always
in world space and mostly because this code
relied on everything being in world space
and it’s a lot easier to just let it do
it’s world space calculations.
Then when it’s time to talk to physics which
is this fun bad boy here, we’re gonna make
sure that, let's see…
In this part of the code, it gets the character
physics and it reassigns the grid, but there
could be an instance where the physics is
behind and the entities and new grid and just
haven’t synced yet, so if we’re going
to transform those positions into our physics
now, there world space currently, but we have
to convert them to the zone that the physics
is in.
So the first thing we want to do is make sure
that our physics is going to be in the proper
zone that our entity is in.
So I’m doing this bit of code.
What this does is we added a…
I should say Ivo added current grid to this
function and what this does is when this function
gets called we actually get the entity grid
of the player so that we immediately know
the correct grid we should be in and so now
our physics goes in the correct grid and we
add this little flag here saying, “Hey we’ve
done a grid change, check to make sure the
physics should update my position or velocity
values based off that grid”.
So before they were over here in world space
and now they’re in this Freelancer, they’ll
move all of our position information to be
relative to that grid.
Finally, this is where we used those physics
positions from the command buffer as you guys
saw here.
Since now they’re guaranteed to be in world
space these are going to be world space coordinates
however it might be in the grid of some other
thing like the Freelancer.
So now we’re feeding in world space coordinates
to a completely different zone, that’s not
going to work.
So, I’m doing some more fun code, there
we go.
We have this queue transition which is basically
what we’ve done back here but we do it in
reverse.
So we get whatever zone we’re in, we get
the inverted ness transformation so now we
transform our world space difference into
zone space and then we divide it by time.
Basically, getting our differences in our
physics coordinates and applying that as velocity
but since the world space, we transform it
using this inverted matrix to zone space and
then divide it by our time and that gets us
our velocity.
Now our positions are guaranteed to be world
space so it can do its calculations so when
we send it back to physics we make sure we’re
in the correct zone, the entity is in and
then we take those world space coordinates
and convert them to the proper zone space
so we can apply our push velocity on the skeleton
physics.
So recode just finished now, we’re going
to pop back into the game if I fly out, woo
look at that, I keep flying out.
So, I maintain my momentum instead of just
stopping and when I come back in, weee, he
maintains his velocity except when he hits
the bottom he gets friction as he kind of
slows down but jumping out I maintain my velocity,
woohoo.
Zones… and as you can see there’s kind
of a camera glitchiness, there’s still some
other parts we have to fix up too but we’re
slowly making it there and I hope you guys
enjoyed.
So, as you guys saw here we’re having some
fun issues with our world space to inner ship…
going to and from making sure we keep our
velocities, our positions, our angle rotations
and everything perfect so when you go from
one to the other you don’t notice it.
There is still some issues and we’re working
them, it’s a difficult problem especially
when you have a zone, within a zone, within
a zone and you want to make sure you go through
them.
Like you’re in a Hornet and you get out
of and then you’re in a big ship, in a big
ship, in a big ship, you have to make sure
those transformations all look and feel correct
and it’s a big challenge especially syncing
up our physics from our game codes since they’re,
you know, in two different threads running
at different times, keeping those in sync
at different points is very, very hard but
we have people in Frankfurt, the UK and even
here working on it to make sure your experience
is better.
Thanks to you guys for posting those bugs
especially when we had the PTU, they helped
out quite tremendously, hope you guys enjoyed
and I’ll see you guys next time.
