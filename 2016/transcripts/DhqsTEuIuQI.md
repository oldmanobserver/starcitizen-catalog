Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome to
Bugsmashers.
Ready to smash a bug?
Let's get started.

News Network.
Hey everyone.
We are here in my fun little test level and
this week is kind of a special bug.
It’s more or less kind of a global bug on
how we’re dealing with the items and the
new items as we kind of merge over in time.
I want to show you some of the things that
we were solving with the old system by using
the new system.
So let me plop down a new Hornet.
So this is our test Hornet and as you can
see it has a bunch of these little awesome
red boxes.
We’re actually use a whole new system for
interacting with things, it’s no longer
hit F and do something, it’s a little bit
more intricate and I’ll show you that right
now when I plop down.
So when I go up to one of these interaction
points, you just have a bunch of options of
what you can do in this particular area.
So in this interaction I could open the ladder,
open the front canopy or open the back canopy
and on the top, I could either open the ladder
or the front canopy and in the back I could
open the rear canopy and the ladder.
So it’s a whole brand new interaction system
which is pretty cool.
We’re going to be using this for pretty
much everything for now on, but what the vehicles
and items are using this for is, specifically
with the seats and animations, we wanted to
have a lot more control for the designers.
So we have, let's see where is my, there’s
DataForge.
Here’s fun DataForge.
We have this thing called a seat access, which
controls these two seats and in the seat access
we define a bunch of gateways which is going
to be one per ladder, one for the front canopy,
one of the rear canopy and how all the animations
and interactions all get tied up so that when
you come in here, I can choose the interaction
to open that stuff down.
So I can bring down the ladder, close it back
or open the ladder and open the back canopy
and so on.
The next part of that actually defining our
entrance points.
For the Hornet we have, well four ways…
actually quite a few ways.
So we have, one way is through the ladder,
but you could enter into the pilot or you
could enter into the co pilot and in order
to enter that way you have to open up the
ladder and open up the front canopy.
So once the front canopy is open, I have some
new options to enter the pilot seat or the
co pilot.
So if I enter the rear, now I can just enter
the pilot, but on the very top, our zero G
access, all we need to do is enter here.
So if I close the ladder, I have still the
ability to enter through the canopy because
that’s the zero G entrance way.
So let's go down here and go through the ladder.
Weee.
So I’m entering through the ladder…
So now I’m in and I could close the canopy.
Eh let's do, weee.
Of course I can reopen it and the best part
of it and my ship is not technically on, I
have to power it on so if I look directly
here.
Now my ship is powered on and now it’s powered
off and you can see that with our fun debug.
As my ship slowly falls.
On the top you can see that there’s no power
going to anything because everything is red,
but as soon as power on the ship everything
goes green and now I can shoot my weapons,
pew, pew, pew.
If I turn off, I can no longer shoot.
On and then off.
Ideally what’s going to happen is when you
get into the ship you’re gonna have to turn
on the power or turn on the engines and or
hit this one thing that will turn everything
on and then you’ll be able to close the
canopy and fly away.
The next thing that we’re kind of doing
is…
Let’s see I’ll turn on this.
We have a whole new system of control, for
when you sat down in the old system, oops
I got out of my seat, you would gain access
to every single item and they would all turn
on and then when another person sits down,
it was very unstable of who would get what.
Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn’t.
Now we have this new thing where we have a
user, a controller, and then the actual items.
The user will control the controller and the
controller dictates what to do with the item.
You have an energy controller, a flight controller,
a weapon controller and you could actually
designate who the controller should go to.
Like at the moment we have two energy controllers
which if I sit down in the pilot seat, I’ll
get both of them, but if the copilot sits
in the back, he’ll automatically get the
other one and eventually there’ll be the
real HUD support where you can say could “here,
you have access to this now and you get it”.
So you won't get the individual items, you’ll
get the actual individual controller and the
controller dictates what you can use and see.
And as you can see I haven’t set up everything
for the new item, but the controller are there.
So if I sit back in, we’ll go through the
zero G entrance because why not, I have access
to the energy controller and the flight controller
and the cooler controller and the fun stuff
and if the other guy gets in the back, he’ll
get access to the powerplant which is pretty
nifty.
Well I hope you guys enjoyed our little sneak
peek on the item system 2.0 and our new interactions.
You guys will see more stuff in the future.
Till next time.
So I hope you guys enjoyed a little sneak
peek on our item system 2.0 and our interaction
system.
We did a lot of work on componentizing a lot
of things.
So we have a physics controller, we have an
interaction controller, we have a bunch of
things that we can grab and now make items
or entities with and stick them onto a ship
and then we have this whole new logic where
we have the user who controls controllers
which controls items, so you could have a
specific logic and then you could make sure
that this guy gets that access, this guy gets
that access and it’s all coming along lovely
and we hope to get it into your guys’s hands
soon, eventually, one day.
Hope you guys enjoyed and I’ll see you guys
next time.
