## Transcript

all right hey everybody can you hear us
let us know let us know if you can hear
us take it from the top yeah we'll take
it from the top if we can thing we do
six times a week soon as we know that
people can hear us yeah there's yay okay
so now that you can hear us guys welcome
to reverse the verse our special January
subscriber Edition uh as a perk to
subscribers we do one of these every
month where we bring in our an esteemed
guest and take questions specific
speically from subscriber chat today's
special guest is technical director of
content y Mr Sean Tracy and I knew that
before I didn't just ask him uh we're
going to take questions from con from
our subscriber chat only and from a
thread that exist in subscribers Den uh
while we're collecting questions why
don't you tell people what you do sure
and how you do it so they can form their
questions around relevant topics sounds
good he does it very
well so uh te technical director um
specifically of content um so everybody
knows we have uh upwards of four
technical directors across the company
uh we have uh two in Frankfurt one in
the UK and then one here um so I'm the
representative here um and again if uh
nobody's really aware of what a
technical director rule sort of does um
you basically hit the uh the amount of
expertise uh that you retain for
whatever whatever your role is as is at
the highest level that you can basically
get it to um typically a technical
director will be an expert programmer uh
by by some description so uh carsten
wiel and Marco corbetta are technical
directors in Frankfurt so they're the
engine technical directors uh
essentially how they're they're
organizing how the engine is being
created what we're going to do with the
engine how we change it um and really
really major uh architectural
modifications things like this uh then
we have derck senior and uh he's the
programming director within the UK but
typically your programming director is
actually your technical director um so
since we have so many different
engineers in the UK working on gameplay
systems um all the uh you know the mini
puu features uh he is the tech director
out there and then it's myself over here
in this time zone now what I'm more
responsible for uh in the in the last
little while anyways is all the data
that's going into the game we basically
have two very important directories
within our build and one is code and the
second is data so every single asset you
see within the game whether it's a
character ship particle effect sounds
things like that I'm responsible for
that and really it's um basically
anything that comes out of some sort of
DCC tool and goes into the engine or
goes into the game that's up to me so we
keep calling them pipelines and things
like this so I've got to manage all the
pipelines and I'm trying to deprecate
the word Pipeline and just call them
checklists because it's so much easier
for people to understand like pipeline
is such this nebulous sort of like oh I
work on the pipeline but now really you
work on a set of checklist list items
that is like goes here goes here goes
here finish that and all those
interdependencies so um yeah I'm making
sure that we're using the engine the
best we can uh making the content the
fastest way we can I mean yeah I don't
know it's not a job interview so I guess
I'll just stop there what's a DCC tool
oh I'm sorry it's a digital content
creation so it's like 3ds Max Maya um XS
well I don't even know if that exist
anymore um uh uh zbrush is yeah you DCC
Photoshop I mean I knew I was just
asking for sure you did all right our
first question uh comes from our
subscriber thread since there aren't any
questions in subscriber chat just yet uh
This Thread says the procedural Planet
Tech demo looked great what are some of
the challenges in getting us to the
point where players can actually land
anywhere on Crusader there are so many
challenges I I wow I mean that that's a
pretty broad question um so I guess I'll
pick a couple uh points that we're
dealing with right now um one of the
hardest things to deal with obviously is
the physics of this so not not so much
in terms of the scale um but you can't
okay so the way physics really works
within the game you've got a bunch of
render mesh and then you've got a
physical proxy which is a way way lower
res representation of whatever you want
to collide with um the reason it's got
to be so much lower res is that you are
doing so many more calculations on that
uh than you are on on a render measure
or something like this because
eventually you'll just render it but in
physics we're interacting with it we're
shooting things at it we're crashing
into it we're doing all kinds of
different things so the problem is with
with a with a planet of you know 10,000
kilometers or something like that you
cannot possibly load that entire physics
mesh all the time and even worse even if
you tried to do that the the sheer count
of that even if it was lower res would
be so high um so what we have to do is
dynamically load this physics um and
we've got to load it on a sort of a per
client basis because you typically on a
server you'll actually load all your
physics data all at once you'll have it
all just sitting there you won't stream
the physics in or out um it'll just be
sitting there and obviously we can't do
this on a on a 10,000 kilometer planet
that has uh mountains and hills and all
sorts of uh all sorts of different
things so that's one of the biggest
challenges that we have um but we've
already got it work in which is pretty
pretty neat to know um I don't know when
we'll we we show that but yeah we've got
we've got something quite nice working
for that so we'll calculate on a per
client basis um so that was one of the
biggest hurdles to actually making this
uh playable uh uh for the players
because obviously if you don't have
physics on a Terrain you fly right
through it and it'll kind of ruin the
whole experience um so yeah that was one
of the bigger ones um on top of that of
course is just the visuals of of the
planet itself uh I mean how does that
look look um how does it look and again
the scale is just insane uh how does it
look when you're you know 300 km 300,000
km out from that planet you've got to go
from you know this planet just
inheriting one pixel on the screen to it
taking up the entire screen to it being
like you are inside of of a level you
know um so being able to transition
through the atmosphere making that look
hyper real was really really challenging
um how many LEDs are involved in that
it's actually way more complicated than
that and I wish I could say there was
like six lods or something like this no
there was so many different levels of um
processing that happens on the way in so
sure there's a bunch of lods as you're
approaching but once you get in there it
is it is it's a dynamically tesselated
objects so essentially what you're doing
is you're only going to tessellate the
objects that are really close to you or
the or the sectors even that are really
close to and most game engines have a
Terrain system that works this way uh
unreal has a cry engine has a base uh
sort of terrain system that works on
this uh uh this Dynamic amount of
tessellation the trick is to get that to
convolve around a sphere first of all
and then second of all is to be able to
synchronize this all over the network
right so and again that that's got to
lend itself to physics that's got to go
across different clients uh yeah there's
a lot of challenges when it comes to
this and then maybe the last one that
I'll talk about is um the actual objects
on the surface itself now I'm not
talking about like procedural objects or
like trees and rocks and things like
this I mean Landing
zones if you have an IDE like to give
you an idea Area 18 um that that level
right now we're talking you know four to
six gigs of data uh within that level so
imagine flying up to one of these
planets which is pretty heavy by itself
uh and then also having to load that
Landing Zone on the way in um to be able
to stream that amount of data you can
absolutely do this but can you do it
seamless can you make it look like it's
not just pop po po pop bunch of objects
sort of streaming in um that's a huge
challenge so that's something that we're
working on on in the engineering front
with these things um that Chris talks
about on occasion called object
containers and uh these sort of things
so um we've got a very unique game where
we basically have to be able to stream
everything out and everything in at at
runtime um so it's a very very
challenging thing to do there is very
few level loads so you can't just sit
there and load everything behind the
scenes so challenge but we have our we
have our plan in place yes absolutely
and it's starting to work yeah right
yeah Carl Jones are our CEO uh here at
cig we had a a saying when we both used
to work for krych and that was difficult
takes a day and impossible takes a week
so this one is is is on the level of
impossible right but but we're
absolutely going to achieve it right
sadly that's going to be the headline
right right they will yeah I say today
will be confirmed planets are done a
week no that's not true the impossible
impossible uh what can you tell us about
physicalized Eva I know uh there were
some expectations that it might be in
2.1 originally uh because you came on
the show and said it might be in 2.1 no
and it was and we pulled it out actually
P out y we pulled it out on purpose
where we at with that now uh it looks
like it's definitely going into well I
say definitely wow I am so going to not
say definitely um it's in our Branch for
2.2 right now now so uh it's basically
the same that we we were at with 2.1
however there's been a ton more work
that's been done on it one of the
biggest problems um was it has nothing
to do with crashes has nothing to do
with performance has everything to do
with the way it feels like like the
control of it um because fundamentally
we changed the way um that the that the
character is getting locomoted around uh
when you're in the Eva you are now we
call it a driven ragd doll um it's a
it's a similar system to if anybody's
seen these animations system called
morphine or uh in FIFA actually is a
really good example they use a very
similar system uh where there's a
there's a there's a level of driven ragd
doll so you are we call it an
articulated entity um so basically
you're a set of rigid bones right that
is getting driven around but you've got
to blend animation on top of just
physical impulses that is moving it
around whereas the older Eva and what
everybody's using right now is an
animation driven um Eva so we say entity
move here entity move here entity move
here but the animation just plays based
on how you're moving it's very very it's
actually pretty simple it's just you're
moving forward well animate like this
you're moving backwards well animate
like this um so with driven ragd doll
it's a lot more tricky because of all
the physics that gets involved with it
so the reason we want to do driven ragd
doll um is we want the body to react to
things in zerog as as you would expect
them to react now I think a lot of
people saw some some of the fun videos
that came out of uh the initial
implementation of it right uh where we
hadn't tightened up a whole lot of the
limits so like somebody could go near a
ship and if it hit their head their head
would bend almost you know all the way
backwards and things like this um so
again right it was all about scaling
those uh those physics impulses and
those sort of things but really getting
the control better um because our frame
of reference changed so drastically
between the old Eva and the new Eva and
what I mean when I speak of frame of
reference is and it's something I talked
about before where where we would use
the origin of the character or is you
know like write down this is a character
and this is the feet of the character
and in the middle of the feed is the
origin right we've just got z0 and
that's where our origin is but when
you're in Eva actually your origin
changes your center of mass becomes
Dynamic which is quite cool um usually
it's around the hips but because it
moves around a little bit um that makes
controlling it really tricky because
you've got to have something that is
saying okay this is my forward Direction
which way is forward which way's up
which way's down these sort of things um
so yeah um there's been a lot of great
check-ins on it and it
feels so many levels better um than than
it initially felt so where there'll be
bugs probably but we'll have to we'll
have to cross those bridge when we get
there why don't we just fake it why
don't we just fake well that's what we
had before right was fake evva and you
know everybody was happy with that I'm
not saying that it was awful um but
visually okay visually I thought it was
awful because here's my problem is when
you pitch or or you you sort of rotate
you were rotating around the feet and
again you know we only had some limited
free flight and even in the mini PTU are
you really sitting there staring at a
guy doing a lot of Eva not so much but
let's say you're in a gunfight with a
guy and all of a sudden he presses e and
he starts rotating around like this it
just looks stupid it it it looks fake
and that that's not what we want and
most people would say okay how about you
just offset that that that origin to the
hips and then just rotate around that
well that's a little bit tricky because
actually the animation system is
assuming that origin is between the feet
so it's better to go change it to an
articulated en get all these bonuses of
actually being a driven ragd doll um um
so like you know flying into stuff and
your arms reacting your head reacting
and mostly your legs reacting um than it
was just to continue to fake it if that
makes any sense um the other big win
that we get out of this is another
system that we worked on sort of in
concert with the physical Eva and it's
we call it we called it fall and play
back in the the crisis days uh but for
us it's more like fall and play and fall
um so what it means is and uh the
implementation is going to get a little
bit bigger um as you transition in and
out of gravity is kind of our big thing
um right now how it works is as soon as
your pivot comes within some sort of
gravity volume boom we just drop you
down and you land on your feet whether
or not you were coming in head first
whether or not you were coming back
first or anything like this so what what
I wanted to do with it was basically
give you um uh a range that that you
would be able to land on your feet
essentially so you know right now I
think we've set it to 20 or 30° um and
it's it's like a little cone uh so again
if you consider the the the pivot of the
character you can be rotated you yeah I
think it's 30° um you can be rotated
sort of 30° uh forwards backwards
sideways you're basically within this
tone of of I can land on my feet um so
when that happens you transition into
zerog G boom you know you're able to
actually land but if you come in head
first what do we do right now we could
try to animate you know a bunch of
different directions um but this gets
really heavy to maintain and also it
doesn't really look right so instead
what we do is when you transition into
into gravity we set you to ragd doll
driven ragd doll um and well you
technically already are if you're in
zerog G but uh we kind of take the
control away we put we put uh you
already have mass so we put gravity to
you so what will happen is you kind of
you lose control a little bit um but if
you came in head first you actually ragd
doll you're under Gravity affection and
you will fall blam and and and and and
oh don't hit the table cuz the
microphone will BL um um you land on the
you land on the ground whatever in ragd
doll and you know your arms will go all
over the place or whatever um and then
what the Fallen play portion of this is
we will blend whatever you've landed in
into a get up animation so we have eight
different Get Up animations and they're
just sort of different ways that the
body could land so it's on the on the
belly on the back on the side um um sort
of Crouch down um and then we will blend
into a get up animation and you will
just get up from your fall so there's a
lot of gameplay that can come out of
this and I know this sounds like
very um you wouldn't see the direct
impact of some gameplay with this but if
you consider things like an FPS level or
uh even within a station that has
gravity generators so let's consider
you've got two different teams and you
are fighting in this sort of area now if
you are in communication with your team
and you control some sort of gravity
generator or something like this you can
use this very much to your advantage if
they're in you know let's say we have a
hanger and a gravity generator you've
got the other team in the hanger and
they're flying around all over the place
they're you know they're going to town
on your guys because they've got zero
gravity they can go upside down and all
these sort of things you get that other
team way up in the air and you tell your
other guy throw on gravity gets who's
all falling down and they have to get up
and you've basically got about five six
seconds of of of just picking them off
right as they're getting up off the
ground um and then additionally right
there there's other things that we could
build on uh I'm not sure if the
designers have have really uh fleshed
this out yet but how much better are you
at at U transitioning from zero gravity
to gravity is that 30° actually for you
more like 40° is this you know a
character progression thing is this
something that you can have an item for
um do you have do you have thrusters on
your suit that can help you with this
you know are you are you like a cat can
you always Lin on your feet you know
there's all sorts of little bits of uh
gameplay that can go into this so that
was a really long-winded answer for kind
of what's going on with with physical
Eva but uh again it's a real exciting
thing because I don't think it's been
done before not not like this anyway
eight different Get Up animations uh
eight eight different directions yeah I
only have one get up animation it
involves grunting grunting and their
sounds yeah I know that's my sit down to
all right uh this leads us into the next
question sure uh how are FP FPS
animations coming specifically with the
unification between first and third uh
really well uh oh there was a there was
a great thing that happened about two
months ago um our animation director
Steven bner had gone out to Frankfurt
and did a lot of direct work with our
animation R&D programmer so and just so
you guys know a little bit of history on
this too um we all we did work together
at krych the uh R&D animation direct um
the R&D animation engineer uh Steven
bner myself and uh there was a lot of
guys within crch and we had tried to
unify this uh for crisis 2 and even for
Crisis 3 um and we were all pretty much
set in the way that you can't you just
can't there is no way to do it you're
always going to be chasing your tail um
what looks good in first person doesn't
look good in third person vice versa um
but we made a change and I mean I I got
to leave a little bit of magic um so I'm
not going to say exactly what it was uh
but I mean we solved the problem um and
by Wii it was really you know evil Herz
egg was uh Frankford engineer that
really kind of on line of code solved it
um and it was interesting like I made a
little meme for him like it was like oh
a th000 man hours I do in one line or
something like that um but yeah we
solved this and
uh the nice thing about it is it feels
like an FPS again um is the thing it
feels like it the weap is in the right
place it's not bouncing around um you'll
probably see and even if you go look at
the older videos of of the FPS before
any of this implementation kind of went
in the weapons bouncing around
everywhere it doesn't really look like
the solidified firstperson shooter at
the same time we didn't want to have um
static weapon you know we just don't
want to have floaty weapon Chris talks
about it all the time he just doesn't
want a weapon sitting there floating in
your view right he wants it to feel like
you are holding it but at the same time
it's got to feel super responsive and
and the real problem with it is that in
a first-person shooter the weapon is the
only thing that communicates your
movement to you so if you're turning for
example right that that weapon needs to
can and things like this uh um uh good
one is cover so when you go into cover
you can't tell if you're sort of poking
your head out or if you've just moved
the weapon you know so it's the only
thing that really informs your movement
um in first person so if you're juking
if you're doing things like this the
weapon needs to move and that needs to
translate to Oh okay that's how my
character is moving uh a third person
game doesn't have this problem cuz
you're staring at the character you know
exactly what he's doing but a first
person game it definitely does because
you don't know necessarily what your
feet are doing what your whole body is
doing so it gets tricky and cover but um
I would say that it's going really well
um probably better than it ever has been
uh especially since that change because
we've made a bunch of adjustments based
on that that will make developing stuff
even easier a good example of this is uh
We've added an extra layer of Animation
there's actually like four or five
different layers that are happening when
we're in first person uh but one of the
big ones is this uh weapon hands overlay
it's a it's a it's a clip that we can
put on so essentially what it does is we
have very similar animations for like
rifles but we might have different sizes
of rifle so we might have a sniper rifle
which actually I can't hold back here
I'm actually going to have to hold over
here now my hands poses my hand poses
haven't changed dramatically but they've
changed enough that actually we have to
do something so what you you'll see is
um we've got this extra layer of
Animation that actually all we do is we
just put one animation to move that hand
to that location we link everything up
with ik and we're good to go um so what
this all means is that we can make more
weapons faster without having to
uniquely animate every single one of
them um that's a big big big win so so
yeah a lot of this stuff then um and
sorry I know I just keep talking on and
on um the the um this is oure the start
stops
the start stops have have made super
good progress so this was some
interesting stuff that Stephen bner
actually came up with some really good
ideas on um and then the Jukes
themselves are still a bit of a
challenge um we're we've got them and
they're responsive now um and so
everybody knows like the the original
implementation of the Jukes felt super
unresponsive that was our really biggest
problem with it um and you know just
being totally open about it you were you
would play on Mouse and uh you would I'm
a mouse and keyboard guy so you'd be
playing on Mouse and keyboard and you
would be strafing right and then all of
a sudden you would press left and
something would happen and then
eventually you would end up going left
and even having you know six frames of
delay or seven frames of delay was
enough that it felt super sluggish was
the problem and that was one of our
concerns uh in releasing it
because if you didn't see what was
happening in third person if it was
awesome in third person if we were
making a third person game we would have
been done like that was easy but in
first person that communication done
with the animations side get to get me
in trouble yeah no kidding um in first
person it's so much harder to
communicate that movement and and most
people are so used to Call of Duty or
Battlefield or something like this that
is this instant response and we have to
keep that instant response because
otherwise it's not that fun um you feel
like your character is controlling you
rather than you controlling your
character um so yeah there's been some
great stuff on the start stops uh then
Additionally you probably saw that
there's new Locomotion sets within the
mini puu so those are doing really uh
they working really well um the other
thing that's kind of exciting about them
and I mean it depends who you are to see
how exciting this is but uh there's
three Cycles within them so these are
three cycle runs three cycle walks I
know that sounds like oh yeah yeah you
know and what I mean three Cycles is you
know left right left right left right so
wait
correct so you go left right left right
left right um reason that's good is that
we can actually make it um not
completely symmetrical so basically the
second step on that is just there's a
tiny bit of a shoulder dip in it or
something like this they T they tend to
look a lot more realistic than just a
single cycle run because a single cycle
run is like perfect all the time you
never ever see anything different but um
you know if you go into the game right
now you'll see the one that's that's the
most obvious is is the backup and it's
probably a little too obvious and we'll
probably chill it out but when you're uh
when you're um running backwards you'll
notice that the shoulders kind of dip
down into it um it and it's only on one
of the one of the Cycles but it looks
really good uh I think it looks a lot
more real is is the
point uh I'm getting a special
telepathic message from Hennessy please
stop hitting the table please stop
hitting the table oh is that me I'm
sorry I get
excited next question is about turrets
on our on our multi- grw ships um right
now they're not the most responsive
they're they're not the the funnest the
most fun gameplay experience at the
moment what are we doing to improve
turret performance uh a lot of testing
really so we're trying a lot of
different different um ideas um Chris
has a really
good direction on this where what we
want to try um and this is this is
something that we're just doing
internally right now um the turrets as
they work right now you sit in it you've
got a Crosshair and you are moving
Crosshair and that's that's how it's
moving with you now the problem with
this is that it's actually not like
anything else in your ship like if
you're sitting in the pilot seat right
you've got a nice floating reticule
everything sort of follows up behind
that um what we want to do is Implement
that have it sort of like a floating
type reticule that that the turret will
sort of catch up to problem with that is
the responsiveness right you've got to
make sure that that moves fast enough um
and if it doesn't Mo If It Moves too
fast it feels super fakey If It Moves
not fast enough it doesn't feel
responsive enough and I'm not you know
there's no promise that we're going to
do this uh we're going to try it
internally and we're going to see if
that feels any better is the thing um
the other thing that I think will help a
lot is just a little bit of feedback on
where your ship is facing um and this
has to everything to do with UI uh which
way your ship is facing which way your
turret is facing uh yeah I I mean that's
that's pretty much all I know right now
on the on the multi crew turrets but I
know there's guys in the UK really
looking at this pretty hard right now
I'm just not super involved in it that's
all
okay hair character hair mhm uh what are
the possibilities of stresses and using
something like tress effect or the new
AMD technology Pure Hair what's her plan
for hair so I don't know too much about
Pure Hair um I know that they've
released an update to trust effects and
we evaluated trust effects and here's
something here's a little bit of History
again on uh when Tres effects 1.0 rolled
out um I was part of the krych team that
did the implementation originally for
Tress effects into the cry engine so
basically AMD had come over with all
their work on Tomb Raider um and we had
done uh a tech demo called the Ruby Tech
demo and you can take a look uh you can
look it up this is something I worked on
with phonic actually um now you know not
to at all speak bad about the tech is
very very cool stuff however we've got
so many characters on screen and for us
to go with just one character having
ridiculously you know granular simulated
hair um and then everybody else in the
scene kind of having you know crappy
poly soup kind of hair um doesn't really
make a ton of sense to us um the other
thing that that is a worry of course is
just the performance implications so in
all the games that have used dress FX um
and again I'm not saying it's like a bad
performing system but it is not a system
for 40 characters on screen it's not a
system for 60 characters on screen it's
really a system for fur of a hero
character it's really a system for hair
of a hero character and again in
something like Tomb
Raider pretty much one character own
screen right um and you may have enemies
and stuff like this but generally you
are only looking at one person um do we
need Super advanced level hair
simulation I would argue probably not
even right I would say that there's
there's things that we can do now with
the item ports and these we call them
skeleton extensions with pretty Advanced
rigging um that will make it a lot
easier for us to do a lot of hairstyles
um without having to sort of resort to a
to a GPU hair um or or or Tres effect or
um I think advidia Hair Works or stuff
like this um so I can't say no for sure
but we have evaluated what was there and
it definitely it just wasn't suitable
for what we wanted and the real trick
with those um Hair Systems and it's just
from past projects having worked with
them is getting the hairstyle you really
want Works real good for you know long
flowy hair that's real straight uh or
even like a a ponytail or something tied
back but as soon as you want some sort
of real retro cut or or something that
looks very
unique it gets tricky it really does um
and the other thing that we have to
consider is the zero gravity of of all
of this um so trust effect effect deals
with
that but it looks a little weird I mean
if I'm totally honest right how it ends
up simulating is not what you would
really expect um so so that really
matters to us with all that said we are
going to have hair um we do have hair on
the characters right now confirmed
um the other and there's one little
other limitation in this and that's the
character customization so because we
want to have characters customized not
only their hair color maybe the style uh
maybe the length you know there's a
there's a really great Korean MMO out
right now um they just released their
character creator which is one of the
best out there and and not to plug them
or anything like that I hav zero
involvement in it whatsoever I'm just
I'm very impressed with the the level of
customization that they brought it to um
is called uh Black Desert I was going to
say don't talking about Black Desert why
not we play I played with that that for
like 15 minutes so they just released
the character and had this weird like
distorted Eric stolon mask thing yeah
and then you w into game with it it's
like but in terms of hair customization
I've never seen a better system never
seen a better system um could do that
with effect sure it's it's shiny hair
but look at all the stuff you can do to
it right you've got control points you
can pull out the hair you can make it
longer shorter you can crimp it you can
do all these things with it and it's
hilarious me talking about hair because
I've got very little of it and you know
like i' my my expertise in hair is
pretty limited um but yeah we want the
characters to be able to customize it
and and again there's so many settings
on the trust effects hair that we would
have to then um persist and serialize
it's probably just too much got
important because all these systems
don't exist don't won't exist in a
vacuum as to be how they will imp will
integrate with everything else that
we're doing yeah and that is that is you
know the the classic Tech director role
is that we've got to make sure it works
with kind of everything um and you can
be the buzz kill unfortunately you're a
bit of a kill Joy sometimes uh where
it's like ah this would be an amazing
feature in this one little situation but
yeah okay but what's it do here what's
it do here what's it do here so I'm just
bummed it sounds like there's not going
to be a Tomb Raider where she goes to
space yeah right right and you I'm sure
it can be supported it's not you know
it's just is it worth implementing and
then changing yourself I'm just happy
you you finally confirmed that we will
have hair in the game
yes uh cuz we can write the lore that
everyone in the future is the same bald
man exactly same face same bald man same
eyes some disease that eradicated the
hair it turns out that's the perfect
evolution of man is a bald guy we're all
powder remember powder that was a bad
movie all right matchmaking do you have
anything to do with matchmaking or our
lobby system not really think so I mean
well a little bits and pieces like I
work with Jason Neely on some of the
game side stuff but uh I mean there
hasn't been uh too much going like
what's the what's the question about it
like where's match about what what the
future of matchmaking will be and stuff
I didn't think right and that's actually
it's it's not a it's not a bad question
um really what we've uh and I'm not even
sure if it's in yet uh is the ELO rating
um so once the ELO rating is online um
and you know it's funny because a lot of
people think that just a little bit of
trivia for you um uh the the ELO rating
is actually a guy's last name it it's
not an acronym it's not EO it's just
it's the guy's last name that came up
with it so just so you guys know but uh
ELO rating is pretty important so that
we can actually matchmake between um
similarly skilled players cuz that's
kind of the biggest concern right is so
that you don't end up with a bunch of
beginners in with the super expert guys
right so I mean I expect that to come
online but that will you'll likely see
that come online as Arena commander
makes uh further progress um but again
the real focus is this is the mini puu
really right now and once we've got you
know Sim pods within the mini puu then I
think you'll see a lot more work and and
a lot more game types in Arena Commander
will bullets from FPS guns be affected
by artificial gravity
or the lack thereof uh right now they're
not they could be uh I mean that's a
system that's already in the cry engine
this the this this bullet drop uh is is
basically the uh the term um and it
whether it's artificial gravity or real
gravity I think it's all technically
artificial gravity because I mean it is
a video game so it's all artificial um
but we could um they're just right now
we haven't been uh working ever at
ranges that it would make sense right um
yeah I'm not even going to try to spit
on numbers but you know most of our
firstperson combat scenarios don't
really extend past 200 yards or 300
yards right now um not not to say that
they won't ever um because things like
Planet Side and stuff like that will
will will change that drastically uh but
currently there just hasn't been really
a reason for
it gotta they're they're they're
freaking out about the ELO rating right
now oh what that did everybody know that
and I just like dropped the trivia and
I'm like oh I'm so smart because I know
this yeah W you tell us what ELO rating
is you said it was named after a guy but
what is the ELO rating uh it's a way to
actually well it's a way to give a
single number uh to your to your skill
set and this is based on kills deaths uh
uh the time played I there's a formula
actually it's it's just a like if you
check the Wikipedia I think it's just a
formula so but again I'm not really that
involved in that side of it but I looked
it up because I asked everybody one time
I'm like what does ELO stand for I
thought it was an acronym and nobody had
the answer but Google did Goa uh okay
how do you plan or do
you sorry how do you plan to do if it's
possible to do with the cry engine for
transferring the mass inertia of a ship
to its
passengers uh I think A variation of
this question I've seen before is Pilots
will red out and black out M will those
effects trans transfer to the people who
are riding passengers in the ships it
totally could um and that's a that's a
really good question and we've talked
about this a lot um a good and let me
sort of take you and again I always turn
these into a story or like a history um
okay so we're two3 of the way through
the so so the best the best way I can I
can explain it was that uh with zero
grav sorry with with the g-forces we uh
there was an initial implementation on
how the pilot reacted to g-forces and it
was pretty crappy if I'm honest um the
next thing that we did was reimplement
or refactor it basically so that it uses
a blend space and what what a blend
space means is that this uh these
GeForce reactions are now parametrically
driven which is super cool because you
can you can pass the GeForce data you
know whatever the value is um uh you can
pass that to a single animation set and
it's just going to blend based on
whatever that that might be the question
that came up and this is now a little
bit more to to the actual uh the topic
um the question that came up during that
is what happens in a local physics G
ship like a constellation uh does the
pilot sit there reacting to the g-forces
whilst he's got co-pilots standing
literally right next to him not doing
anything um and and what we ended up
coming up with was actually within the
local physics to ship no you you would
not actually feel any of this gravity
change if it was artificial gravity this
what do I know I'm not a physicist by
any stretch of the imagination when
you're in a ship that has artificial Gra
gravity uh it's going to compensate for
this effect start Tre called them
inertial dampers inertial dampers right
now uh where we do want some sort of
reaction um and I mean does this make
because there is a kind of a a problem
with the design here um when you're a
constellation pilot you still red out
and black out but yet you're not doing
any real GeForce reactions so does that
really make a lot of sense not really
but it's balanced is is kind of the
thing um what we do want though is De
reactions so Star Trek you know shaking
in the seat whatever um but then we want
people that are standing there to have
some level of reaction we can't take
control away from the player but have
some level of character reaction uh to
the damages and the things that are
going on within the ship um do we have
inertial dampers or anything like that
not really not right now um and how it
all works is just if you're within that
physics grid you basically don't react
uh uh to those things would that extend
to items that are in the ship as well
like cargo or MH like that so cuz I mean
if you think about it yeah if we start
doing that with the player we'd have to
start doing that with the whole cargo
and if your cargo's not strapped down or
whatever and we don't want to have to
force the character or the players to go
to the back of the ship and get a tie
down out and you know strap it down that
would be super silly it's one of those
things where we take it to the edge of
realism and then we have to bring it
back to someplace where it's totally I
say this one thing all the time if you
want realism go sit on the bus bench and
tell me how fun that was you know I mean
it's you know it's games after all we're
take close to realism as we can and then
bring it back to the point where it
becomes fun yeah definitely remember win
Commander had the same exact issue way
back then you ship had in the fiction
acceleration absorbers and in the first
builds if your acceleration absorbers
got destroyed and you tried to
accelerate your guy just died just died
and it was
really it's not that much fun yeah it's
not very fun at all right right now on
crusader
uh players that are inside the local
physics grids can't be
killed I think it was a bug fixed people
Pilots were getting shot through so they
that's right so they made anybody inside
their invol right right now when
somebody jumps on a ship you can't shoot
them you can't do anything you can't
fight people on uh Korea will run into a
ship as a sort of a safeone as yeah it's
like I'm safe I'm safe now that's funny
are we going to fix that what's the plan
definely well yeah absolutely we're
going to fix that cuz of course of
course we want Combat on the ships and
I'm more thinking uh uh larger ships
rather than you know consolation and
Retaliator sort of thing uh but yeah we
want combat to be able to go on on the
ships if somebody's trying to board your
ship you want to be able to defend it uh
if there's people on your ship hanging
out in a seat that you want to get rid
of then you get rid of them um here's
the trick is that H and it's interesting
we just had a meeting about this this
morning uh what we have to implement is
a pierce ability system for our item
components so this is something that I'm
sure you know Chris will talk about or
something like this uh where we have uh
where we have Shield Hull and then the
component within there and we need some
level of Pierce ability for the
projectiles however uh the way the
Pierce ability system works in the
engine right now is basically is can I
go through it or can I not right so if I
say yep you can go through the armor
well I all of a sudden start getting
lasers in the cockpit I got the pilots
getting shot out every two seconds so
basically we had to reel that back um
and we've got to put sort of a deeper
system in place with the Pierce ability
not just a not just a logic check where
it's you know can I go through it or can
I not uh where there's actually a
thickness to it um there's going to be
certain areas in the ship that we just
won't do that with um a good one will
likely be the cockpit I can't confirm
that for sure I'm not a designer by any
stretch of the imagination we've
actually literally the end of that
meeting was okay design go off and you
figure out exactly how you want that to
work and you come back and let us know
and then we will put it in as such um so
yeah that was kind of a quick fix to
make it so that yeah you weren't just
getting shot out of your seat um the the
the real Annoying one to me was when you
were sitting in a turret and like
somebody was shooting at you with a
pistol or something like that and then
that would shoot you out and I mean
that's really cool in Battlefield if
you've got like an M50 you know 50 cal
sniper rifle and you shoot through some
glass or something but I mean I would
think that space glass is pretty strong
um you know if you're going to have it
as something to this you heard it here
first space glass is strong pretty
strong pretty strong transparent
aluminum right
so um yeah I mean the the long term to
that is absolutely you will have combat
within the ship but we don't want you to
get shot with a laser from outside um
into the ship just randomly okay uh the
transparent aluminum com comment takes
us to our next question Cool almost as
if we planned it uh hello Sean hello
hello hi hi that was it who was it as
far as I understood the cry engine does
not natively support rendering the world
into subr
for example as far as this person knows
the C was intended to have a
non-transparent cockpit with just a
drawing of the outside world in a
holographic manner right um is that
still something possible it would be a
great way to enhance immersion MH uh no
and that's a it's a great question a
great uh comment that that he and he's
right um we didn't have the idea there
was just never a need for it um of of
subframes or basically like a picture in
picture um is kind of what he means um
we want it absolutely and there
is inherently in the engine there is
stuff that's doing something very
similar um and the reason I say
something that's doing it very similar
is Stereo does something very similar um
a stereoscopic rendering um or more
specifically the post stereo technique
not the Dual rendering but post stereo
technique um um will render the scene
twice but sorry it doesn't render the
scene twice it renders the scene once
and then actually uh um uh uh generates
that second image based on all the stuff
in that first frame so we could do
something to this effect where we're
taking that stereo render um whatever
the second image would be created and
actually map that down to a poly um the
the trick is is that there's so many um
screen based and now that we're camera
relative rendering there's so many
camera based and Screen based effects
that we do I'm hitting the table again
uh uh post effects um on the screen that
that won't work very well um if you're
trying to do a picture and picture sort
of thing um so you can't do uh uh these
full screen post effects on this tiny
little thing but that's good because um
uh there's other games that get arounded
by not having any color on that not
having any normal mapping on that um you
can make another image uh with less
render passes uh pretty quickly and
we've just we really need an
implementation case that makes a lot of
sense to do that with one of the biggest
things I want to do this with and this
hasn't come from any designer but but
I've talked about it a million times is
that I hate the fact that as a pilot I
don't know where my Gunners are looking
I have zero idea and if I had a tiny
little picture and picture of both
turrets or even one that I could select
where the guy was looking and I got some
sort of remote view that would be
amazing um so I I we're going to move
that direction so that there is this
sense of it's really to to to to get
better teamwork going together uh in the
ship so that you know one that you have
a gunner two where he's looking so you
can actually pile it in a way that
actually that makes sense and three we
need things like security cameras and
things like that so you know it'd be
really cool to have um if you're on a
transport ship or or something like this
to have a to have another security
camera in the back so you can actually
monitor your ship uh Capital ships are
absolutely going to need this um so that
you can actually check different areas
of the ship for borders and stuff like
that exactly without actually changing
the full screen render um and then and
then further examples of that is maybe a
cockpit that's completely closed um you
know how does that work um so there is
ways to do it it it is absolutely not
inherently um uh uh supported in the cry
engine it's not something that it had
ever had the idea of doing uh but there
has been other lenses um not just cig
that had interest in that and have done
it um a good example um of a liccy that
did it was a big red button when they
did Sonic Boom um they actually made
split screen rendering so that that is
the exact same concept as as having
little picture in picture so um it's all
about using all that data that you get
from one frame and and compositing an
image based on some of the information
that you can reproject onto that new one
and in any game they usually a frame
delayed there's usually one frame behind
so whether or not people notice that's a
different story so I hope that answers
that it's you know kind of a
roundabout you only go roundabouts okay
that's true that's true here here's a
here's a pretty simple direct question
we'll see see how how concise an answer
you can give to this one it's be a
personal Sean Tracy challenge all right
let's do it with the release of the
Oculus Rift in the HTC Vive this year
we're wondering if Squadron 42 episode 1
is planned to have official VR support
upon release yeah I can't answer that um
I can't uh cuz actually I don't know um
do we have VR support sure um is it an
expected thing to support for squadron
42 release I expect so but it's really
more of a question for Chris I can't um
this is less of a technical question uh
because absolutely could but then again
everything's possible just a matter of
time and money but yeah so can't really
answer that and that's about as concise
as it gets let's get that one in a TI
for the Sherman all right
um going through questions
but folks like Sean wouldn't have
anything to do with the scitec
pre-orders stuff like that so no looking
for questions that are actually relevant
to Mr Tracy although I can comment on
the scitech pre-or it's going to be a
little bit longer we were planning to do
it uh end of January um we've decided
instead to do a little bit closer to
when the actual items will be shipping
they're they're firming up their uh
production schedule now so uh it's not
going to be in the not going to be
immediately but it's still coming so is
the design final can I ask can I ask a
question um what I think it's pretty
finalized okay like the really big one
right like the the screen one and
everything in fact isn't there people
from side here who s I'm not sure
they're FKS from here today actually oh
is that the guys that were okay so got
some guys walking around I had no idea
who they were they seemed important yes
they seemed very important I we don't
know who they are yeah whatever all
right uh integrated voice chat have
there been any thoughts about that I
know a lot of people have seen this uh
there's a tech demo where there's
positional audio where you hear people
farther away when they get when they get
farther away oh sure I mean that's not
um and I I totally write that off like
it's a easy thing um there a lot of the
voice chat stuff does that already so
team speak is it's a great example
actually uh TeamSpeak you can set any of
the users to be in a different 3D sort
of area so you know I'm playing with you
i' have you behind or over the right
hand or wherever um for us to know where
the other players are that are speaking
is super easy I mean we we know that
pretty much all the time um and within
your vicinity we know it even more
accurately uh so absolutely we can do
this um The Cry engine already has a
voice over IP system within it um it the
quality is not really where anybody's
happy with it right now um and actually
the bandwidth is pretty high so we had
talked to a couple vendors um that have
different you know tech for this kind of
stuff and really in the end we've just
kind of decided that we'll just do our
own um it it makes a lot of sense to
just do our own now will it support the
3D position audio that's going to be a
that's going to be a must um so it's
definitely going to have to if you're
piling a ship and you know again Connie
is a good example you got two co-pilots
right and this guy says something I yes
definitely it has to come out of the
right ear I mean it's going to sound
absolutely ridiculous it's just a
disembodied sort of voice um where
things get even crazier is is some of
the ideas uh that have been floting
around about runtime facial stuff
whereas you know the guy is talking and
you look over and his guy's Flappy lips
sort of thing yeah your webcam is
recording your face and as you move your
exactly so that's there's there's little
bits and pieces of R&D on this like and
it might it might surprise you to know
that a lot of our facial animators will
just capture their own faces a lot of
the times when they're testing stuff
they're just with their webcams sure I
mean um and uh actually in one of the in
the bishop Tech demo uh there's a big
range of motion that he does that was
all captured from the facial animator
from his webcam so I mean all this all
that Tech exists is just what's the
priority of it not that high right now
um we know we can do it uh it's going to
benefit the players better when there's
a better party system when that's a
little more clear um yeah I I mean I I
just it's a bit cart before the horse
right now so do we know how we'll do it
yeah we have a pretty good idea so a
better party system is there a better
party system coming to Star citiz there
will be eventually absolutely but here's
the thing the the party system still
doesn't work as it's designed right um
the contact system is not perfect by any
stretch of the imagination this is one
of my biggest frustrations with the game
right now because I mean it doesn't we
don't have to reinvent the wheel on this
is my opinion is you know there's a
bunch there MSN doesn't exist anymore
but uh Skype uh Yahoo messenger I mean a
billion different communication um um
messaging systems that have been created
before and there's no reason for us to
reinvent the wheel so we should just be
kind of doing what works um so for me
that that's a big frustration but that's
got to come online before you even worry
about some of that Vib stuff um so
yeah all right got time for a couple
more
questions what what important Tech are
you not sure about what important Tech
are you not yet sure about will
work that's a great question CU it's
it's kind of our job to to know how each
and Let Jesus got on the roof elephants
on the roof sorry I know we shouldn't
even people to stop us from answering
this
question uh
yeah yeah I it that's that's a tough one
I'm going to have to think a couple
minutes about that and in doing that
I'll just I'll just fill the air with
with words um normally our job is to
know how we're going to attack something
and I mean really very seldom do we just
jump into something and have zero idea
with a naive level of sort of
development the stuff that scares me the
most is the stuff that we don't know
that we don't know and I know that
sounds kind of you know nebulous but
that's the stuff that bites us um is
when you're not not sure there's going
to when you don't know about a problem
that's going to be coming because if you
already know that this problem's going
to come you have some sort of solution
that we can come up with and we've done
that in almost every case that's
Universal to all game development
absolutely human thought really sure
sure and and those are the things that
scare me the most so if if I was to
answer the question I would say the
stuff that we have not yet seen that it
is going to be a problem that's the
stuff that I'm I'm the most worried
about and that I don't know how to solve
because I don't know the problem that's
why they call it one of the reasons why
they call it game development not game
building we're not we're not there's no
blueprint at the very beginning we're
just building what somebody else has
already figured out you know just a to B
to C to D we are discovering and
exploring the the solutions and the
options that we have towards making the
game throughout the entire process and
we will be right up to the point where
we we release the game and even after
that absolutely um yeah I mean most of
us want to just keep building up on
stuff and you know if if any one of the
these developers got 6 months to work on
one thing they would come up with so
much new so many different things um and
again it's just really about triaging
how much time you you you can allow them
to spend on certain certain pieces of
attack okay will local gravity in a
system ever affect the the performance
of a ship like when a ship gets closer
to a planetary body a star a planet or
something maybe just a really big
asteroid we all want this yeah uh we do
um what it will be is can't believe I'm
calling this a smaller scale will be on
a planetary scale uh originally so as
you approach a planet that's when it's
going to do something um the ranges I
couldn't even begin to tell you about
likely what you'll see is that when you
start doing the atmosphere entries
that's when you'll be affected by that
planet's gravity now are you going to be
affected as you just approach it is
there going to be a station
orbiting not out of the gate G um
there's a lot of problems to solve in
there and one of the biggest ones is
just relative velocities um because if
you've got a space station you know
orbiting a planet that's the Space
Station's moving at you know whatever
13,000 miles an hour um and your ship
only really moves at 300 how do you ever
get to the station right it will always
outrun you or you know things like this
um unless you then have yeah right some
level of gravity that will give you a
gravity assist give you the velocity to
actually catch up to that and be in that
same frame of reference but that yeah I
mean it opens up so many so many
problems um so originally originally um
out of the gate uh you can look forward
to the planets yes having some gravity
uh that will affect you as you as you
get close and and I'm talking pretty
close um but not when you're super far
away or anything like that now having
said that we've got all sorts of tech
online for Gravity Wells gravity streams
um so whether there's like a nebula that
has weird gravity with in it whether
there's a black hole that sucks you in I
mean there's all sorts of different
things that we can do with gravity right
now um we just don't have the designs
really solidified for for what they all
need to do um is the thing but we've got
all the tech online to do that stuff
with and it could absolutely um be done
would there ever be a a ship that could
affect another Ship by proximity as it
not like just in terms of it mass or
it's like a weapon or something like
like like the Vandal King ship or
something like that was that Ian I'm not
a physics person I'm I'm I'm a little
bit and I'm not sure that it would even
have mass enough to do that I mean what
do I know though how much does a
kingship weigh 50 lbs at least Lots over
9,000 easy um so yeah no that's a that's
a good question I I doubt that you'll
see it on the ships though um it just
doesn't really make a lot of sense
unless that ship is just gigantic I
would think though if there's a weapon
of some sort like a gravity generat like
gravity well gener yeah that' be super
cool sort of what an interdictor is
though isn't it uh ships interdiction
ships create artificial gravity WS to
pull things out of I don't know anything
about interdiction ships yet Jared I'm
just talking about in sci-fi in general
SciFi not specifically to start um yeah
I think that'd be cool I think it'd be
cool to have weapons that actually
modify the gravity in certain areas
that'd be cool uh somebody was asking
how we test multigroup functionality if
the lobby system sucks so much uh it's
cuz we don't test on live servers we
test on internal builds with internal
servers where we don't have to fight
with anybody to get in uh yeah that and
that's kind of the win there and also we
can increase the player count as we need
to internally um it's really it's a
pretty quick sear for us um to to change
that um all right let's look for our
last question cuz we are pretty much out
of time already oh that was fast y
That's why we like these ones that's why
we invited you it's like we bring you in
it's a day off for us it's a day off for
us great uh da da are you imp here we go
are you impressed with how far star
citizens has pushed cry engine did you
think it would ever be used in this
context
um in in this context I.E like solar
system scaled nah uh no like I mean even
even at the original onset when I was
when I was demoing the engine for Chris
uh you know years ago uh the the scale
of the game was smaller right um we
never expected to do a solar system
scale or anything to this sort of effect
um I'm super impressed with where the
engine has gone with this and in fact
you know it very little there's still
cry engine in there but I mean there's
so many improvements across the board um
that I'm
super re I say super a lot um I'm really
impressed with anyways uh one of the
biggest ones is the local physics grid
stuff uh it's a unique sort of selling
point within Star Citizen it's a it's a
unique feature that I've not seen in any
other game uh and that that by itself um
just experiencing that was really really
really cool to see um additionally I
mean there's so many changes around
there um the 32-bit uh uh inverse depth
buffer stuff so that we can actually
render out to that that sort of distance
and then when I first did when I first
loaded the procedural Planet when it had
terrain streaming working all properly
the scale I've I I've gotten so used to
working on you know really
really they're small now you know an 8
kmet level to me was massive right
because if you're talking terrain and
just running around as a guy that's a
that's a lot of terrain uh to work with
so the scale just boggled and it's not
even mindboggling it really screwed up
my sense of perception even in the
editor cuz I might be working around and
I've got this planet there you know it
just looks like a little sphere or
whatever and I start zooming in start
zooming it I'm zooming it I've got to
turn up my camera to a th000 MERS a
second um and just to give you an idea
of like the the the the amount of change
that goes on in the engine we have these
little buttons for camera speed and we
had
0.1.1 and 10 or a one and 10 so we've
had to now add 100 a th000 and we even
have a 10,000 one but there's no real
yeah no reason for that yet um it's just
crazy the the the scale differences to
sort of wrap your heads around so yeah
I'm super impressed with the with the
stuff that's been done to the engine and
no I never expected I never expected to
see it to this scale I guess is uh is is
the the
answer well cool that wraps up uh the
