Chris Roberts (CR): Hello everyone, welcome
to another episode of 10 for the Chairman.
For those of you who have not seen 10 for
the Chairman, this is where I take 10 questions
from subscribers.
Subscribers are the subset of our community
that contribute money every month to allow
us to do all this additional community content.
Things like the Jump Point magazine that we
do every month which is somewhere between
40 and 70 pages and has behind the scenes
like articles on how we built ships or designs
that we’re doing or lore in the universe;
as well as some fiction and course things
like Around the ‘Verse, Bug Smashers, other
things like Ship Shape and all the various
video stuff and of course this program so
thank you very much to the subscribers to
allowing us to do all the community content
which I think really makes a big difference
in Star Citizen because we get to update you
guys all the time and so therefore I kind
of have fun and an opportunity to answer questions
from you guys in general.
So brief update from me, I’ve just came
back to LA from being over in the UK and I
think you guys had seen me and there was a
BBC, “Click” show that had come and visited
us in LA and also in the UK and when I was
over in the UK that was where they were interviewing
me.
Now I’m back in sort of very sunny LA which
is quite nice, but only here for two weeks
and then I’m going to go back and that’s
pretty much my schedule this year as were
cranking out both Squadron 42 and Star Citizen
itself.
It’s being in all the studios so I spend
two weeks in the US, two weeks in the UK,
and a week in germany and it’s actually
quite, it’s a lot of fun sitting around
and working with the various times, driving
through everything which we’re trying to
get done.
So the only thing I have to do so forgive
me if I look slightly tired cause right now
is the witching hour for jet lag for me and
of course we’re recording this before the
Monday when you’ll see this, so I’m still
on the backend of the jet lag, but there you
go, but I’m quite happy to be back in nice
sunny LA before I go back to rainy Manchester.
Anyway, alright let's get started.
The first question is from SP3CTREnyc.
I think it’s kind of meant to be Spectrenyc
with a backwards E ...
[2:28] SP3CTREnyc asks: What type of work
is being done to increase the server population
capacity?
Should we expect to see 24 or 32 player instances
in the near future?
CR: The answer to that is absolutely and I
think if you’ve been watching some of the
chatter on the recent PTU and releases and
what’s going to be in 2.2 it is going to
be 24 players.
So we’ve been working hard on optimising
the areas so we can scale I think I mentioned
before, the biggest issue we have is just
the overhead that the ships have because they’re
very complicated they have multiple items
that have all this functionality, they need
to talk to each other over the network, they’re
attached to ships.
So a ship isn’t just one entity, in the
case of a Hornet it can be fifty or sixty
in the case of a bigger ship it’s a lot
more than fifty or sixty.
So they’re very heavy processing wise in
the server in terms of just simulation and
network traffic.
So in general that’s more of the limiting
factor which we’ve been working on.
So we’re refactoring a lot of things to
make it much more smart about when it has
to update, and all the other things.
And that ties into the work we’ve done in
the past on this other system.
We’ve been doing a whatever you want to
call it; a network LOD and an update LOD that
scopes depending on whether you can see things,
how far away they are, whether they’re acting,
whether it’s another player, whether it’s
relevant to you.
So hopefully all that stuff, helps increase
the load that we can do and we’re doing
things, we’re pushing more and more into
multiple cores and multi-threading to be able
to do more physics processing at the same
time as we’re doing more entity updates
in the simulation.
Part of the result of that is moving to more
players in Crusader and we’ll continue and
we’re expecting to continue to push that
over time to get more and more.
We’re actually working on some backend server
mesh tech that will allow us to mesh a lot
more players, in essentially what would be
kind of sort of the same instance.
But that’s a little further along but I
think it’s exciting so I think we’ll be
able to deliver probably more players than
we were originally thinking in concurrent
areas.
I think actually there’s a question later
about that.
We’ll talk about it then!
[5:06] Sage_Ailig asks: I am curious as to
how tri-monitor support will be handled.
Most games don’t support the full resolution
of all three monitors.
The picture is just stretched to the sides
on the outer monitors.
I would like to know if Star Citizen will
render the picture for all three monitors
without stretching to the sides, or will the
game just stretch out like many others do?
No, I think right now you can set, say if
you have three monitor set up, three 1080p
screens, you can get 5760 across by 1080p
across the three screens and you are essentially
just going to have a greater field of view.
We haven’t focused on that stretched screen
stuff for support so we’ve got some things
that we need to work out.
For instance, when you are wearing a helmet,
how much of that is getting occluded by a
helmet versus not being occluded by a helmet
because one of the things I wanted to do on
the design side was to give you a sense of
wearing heavy armour or a helmet: you get
extra protection, you move slower, drains
your stamina more but also you don’t necessarily
get as much visibility.
I want a situation as you are playing the
game that you will wear outfits appropriately
for the situation like you do in the real
world.
For instance if you didn’t have the restriction
of visibility and bulkiness of an EVA suit
when you are flying around, say in your Constellation,
why wouldn’t you always be in the EVA suit?
In a game?
Because then “Well what happens if we get
attacked and there is depressurisation?
Well then I’ll live!”
But what we want you to do is say you go out
and EVA and come back to your ship then you
take your EVA suit and put it in the locker
and take the helmet off because now you get
a much wider field of view and you’re not
wearing a bulky EVA suit so can sit down in
the pilot’s seat and control things and
do stuff like that.
We’re very much thinking about that tactile
experience to create your behaviour that’s
appropriate.
Then of course if you are getting attacked
and there’s a hull breach then you better
rush and get your EVA suit on quickly before
there’s full decompression because if you’re
not wearing a suit and it decompresses then
obviously that’s not good for you.
So in regards to that, on the multi-monitor
setup, in terms or having the helmets we’re
just trying to think how much would it encroach.
But actually again that would be a good illustration
of why you would encourage people to maybe
take their helmet off.
Because if you took the helmet off you would
get that full three monitor surround and you
get it, obviously, in the chase view and all
that and in the chase views but if you had
a heavy helmet on maybe part of those monitors
are obscured by that.
Maybe not as much as they are now but that
would be idea.
So that is the goal.
We may so some additional support in the multi-monitor
view for you to have specific fields of view
set up for that.
I don’t know if any of you remember the
AMD demo we did, quite a few years ago, when
they were announcing the last round of new
chip technology, that was when we were first
signing our partnership with them, and we
actually showed the game in 5760 by 1080 and
we changed around the view ratio in such a
way to actually handle that format properly
and not have it have that ‘fisheye’ stretched
effect.
And it was quite cool and we may do a bit
more of that but that’s a little further
down on in terms of our priority list because
there’s a lot of other things that we’re
doing graphically and tweaking for before
then.
[8:34] HyperToxic asks: Are there any short
term plans on integrating our hangar and planet
side module with the mini-PU (Universe/Crusader)
module?
Absolutely so that is the goal!
So the goal is really that Crusader which
we’re call the mini PU and that really is
the little baby PU and it’s going to be
growing up in front of your very eyes and
we’ll be adding to it.
So we’re just going to be folding in everything
to that.
Which will be the hangar, which will be the
landing areas.
So as soon as we have the planetary transition;
the procedural planet stuff that we’ve shown,
in a state that we’re sharing with everyone
out there, which isn’t going to be that
far away, it’ll be sooner than you guys
think then you won’t have any of this loading
in separately to ArcCorp.
So you’ll just go to the planet, and then
you’ll fly down, and get landing permission,
and land in the landing area, get out and
move around, interact with people, buy things,
and get missions, and get back in your ship
and fly back.
So that is the goal and that is what we’re
trying to do.
So the process is like you’ve already seen,
well you haven’t necessarily but in the
PTU people have seen that we’ve rescaled
Crusader and this is true on 2.2 but essentially
that’s going to start changing and that
will be Stanton system over the next few releases
that we’re doing.
So we’ll build out ot be Stanton and then
we’ll be going between the different areas
and planets on Stanton, the space stations,
and then ultimately when all that’s working
and we’ve got various missions and a lot
of the echo system working and we open up
and have jump points and then we’ll move
into some other systems.
So that’s the process, you’re going to
see the Star Citizen Persistent Universe grow
in front of your eyes and I think the actual
level of fidelity and detail which you can
see as you move around even in a very compressed
area like Crusader without that many things
to do.
So just means even though we don’t have
hundreds or billions of star systems there’s
still lots to do and lots of detail and lots
of texture and that’s kind of our focus
is to make this feel like an incredibly, cool
and alive and emergent world, that you can
play a trader in some ways people can make
a whole living, a whole life staying inside
one star system.
So there you are, that’s the plans on that.
[10:55] Shaidon Daimos asks: About the 12
month subscriber perk - “Your name in the
game!”
Will we be able to submit our real life name
if we want to?
Or are you just going to take our Star Citizen
names?
No, you can submit whatever name you want.
The only reason why a lot of the times we
have a handle is because it’s ok to do a
handle because you guys have basically said,
yup that’s your game name.
So, that’s fine and some people like their
privacy but it’s up to you so if you want
your real name we’ll put your real name
in, if you want your handle we put your handle
in.
[11:26] Wolf_Frakken asks: Will flight decks
and Wing Commander style carriers be the only
form of carriers we’ll see in Star Citizen?
Or will we see the drop bay approach you used
in Starlancer?
Or another idea?
CR: Well I think in general, I mean obviously
Wing Commander style is sort of influenced
by the classic WWII and modern day style and
the Bengal, obviously saw back in the 2012
video we did and will be in Squadron 42 is
very much along those lines and in some ways
the Idris is like a small, I know we call
it a frigate, but really it’s kind of a
small escort carrier or something like that,
or a scout carrier.
It has a very similar flight deck where it’s
sort of encased, but can open up and you can
fly in and out of it.
We will have some other ships that will be
more like sort of helipad style.
So if you think about say some modern day
ships, they have a helipad or a hangar for
a helicopter and stuff like that.
There’ll definitely be some sort of drop
down where bays open up and you drop down
on some ships and ships can land and be inside
it and of course you have some sort of parasite
style ships which the Constellation is a good
example, where there’s a Merlin that’s
docked in the back that you can get in and
fly around.
So we’ll have various different styles,
I think for instance the Vanduul carrier has
a different sort of launching and sort of
loading mechanism for the ships it’s not
quite the same for the human ones which makes
sense because they’re alien.
So there’ll be variety and we’ll increase
that as time goes on, so there you go!
Alright next question comes from ...
[13:09] Coryphaeus asks: Howdy, got a question
about the procedural tech; how far is it going
to go with the planets?
We know about rocks and grass, but what about
life forms and plant life?
Basically I’m asking about the blending
of artist created content and procedural content,
what’s the mix like?
Our plan is to have all levels of planet from
sort of the basic sort of rocky, barren planet
which we sort of showed a little bit of when
we showed the tech at the end of last year,
and by the way that’s moved on pretty significantly
from where it was when we showed you last
year, so that’s looking a lot, lot better.
But, ultimately, to take it to the level where
you get a Crysis level, which includes things
like obviously the grass, which you mention
the rocks, the vegetation, trees, plants,
water, oceans, streams, wildlife, alien wildlife,
birds in the sky, all that sort of stuff.
Ultimately, our goal will be to create ecosystems
and some certain level of weather and stuff
like that on these planets.
So that’s sort of our roadmap and what our
goal is to use the procedural tools to sort
of generate massive play areas cause an artist
can’t do that by hand, but it’s very much
sort of Artist overseen and Designer overseen.
So we don’t just have a formula and it just
creates stuff and that’s all it is.
It’s using those tools to create these areas,
and then the Designers and Artists are influencing
it by looking at areas and tweaking it, essentially
doing a little guide, hints to the procedural
system of what they want to see in this area.
They want this to be sort of a plain, or is
this mountainous, or is this going to be a
desert, or all these kinds of things.
We’ll also try to have some ecosystems with
some of the wildlife, and allow us to place
down a lot of emergent gameplay that isn’t
necessarily around like landing areas, cause
landing areas are very cool, and we build
those and we’ll build a lot of those out
of pre-fab sets so we can build some fairly
quickly, and some of it will be pretty bespoke
because yeah, Earth is going to be Earth,
and Terra is going to be Terra.
But it’s a big universe and we’ve got
a lot of stuff to populate.
So, we also need areas where you can land,
and for instance maybe you are going around
as a miner looking for minerals, or all these
sort of things that once we have a procedural
world, we can open up where you go down and
look for natural resources.
Those can be generated procedurally, and then
players can go down and mine.
We can also create all sorts of missions down
on planets, like for instance a supply mission;
there’s like scientific outposts that we
just sort of have this couple different sort
of temporary science outposts or installations
and the mission is to take supplies to them,
but you can’t land your ship nearby where
the outpost is, so you have to land it at
the closest available area and then load up
the supplies into your buggy or whatever vehicle
you have, and drive it up to them and deliver
it to get payment.
Maybe there’s a downed ship that you have
to rescue off a planet, and we can have farmers
or settlers.
So there’s a lot of kind of fun sort of
almost mission based immersion stuff that
we can have so it’s not just about spawning
stuff out in space, there could be stuff that
spawns down on planet’s surfaces that cause
destinations for you to do stuff.
So that’s very much like what Tony, and
I, and Todd Pappy have been talking about
in terms of like the mission, sort of the
bigger mission immersion setup that we’re
going to do in the procedural universe.
It will be very cool and it will be done to
the fidelity that we sort of achieve to, and
you’ll see, which is very tactile, very
there, seeing it actually happen.
I think that’s the strength of Star Citizen
is that instead of it being very big picture,
very pulled back, it’s there looking at
you.
Like you’re in your ship and you can see
the seat and the controls, and you get up,
and you can go get in a bed or get in a shower,
or go to the toilet, or sit down at the dining
table, and everything’s there.
You can touch and use it so it feels real.
We want that level of interaction with fidelity
throughout the whole game.
So we won’t be able to do four hundred billion
star systems like that, but we’ll certainly
be able to do quite a few using procedural
tools.
I think it will feel really rich, and really
dense, and really cool.
You have the tools in such a way that the
players actions are generating interest and
action for other players or other NPCs.
I think it will be a really, really, pretty
cool experience.
So yeah, I’m very excited.
I just wish these things were happening quicker!
[17:50] Killarious Maximillion asks: You stated
that all parts of the universe will be instanced
with max amount of players being inside of
an instance and many instances of that same
space can be generated at the same time.
How will that work so people and their friends
always get into the same instance to work
as a team?
Right so I touched a little bit of the top
of this Ten for the Chairman talking about
the fact we are working on getting more and
more people into an individual instance or
really what it’s more about is getting more
people into an individual game server.
So right now if you play in Crusader on 2.2
they’ll be twenty four players that could
be in that now that’s one game server instance.
We actually have that, there’s eight of
those I believe, yep, the thirty two core
server we’re running on and we have eight
game server instances on that one thirty core
server each using four cores.
Now the real goal would be not to have eight
on that, it would be rather to have one game
server on that one thirty two core machine.
So then if we have eight people now and you
add eight times twenty four, you’re getting
a much larger number of people around me almost
at two hundred people at that point and that
would be on one server.
That’s without us doing more and more optimisations,
so that’s what we’re moving towards.
Then on the client side, even though the server
could maybe deal with more entities because
it doesn’t have to render, it doesn’t
have to move all the memory around from it.
It just has deal with the background simulation
and updating stuff.
The clients may not be able to but then the
clients would make sure what’s around you,
what you can see is what it’s drawing and
updating and being told from by the server.
Then on top of that we’re planning to have
seamless server transitions and basically
mesh the servers together.
So instead of ‘I’m in Stanton System and
I’m on one server or i’m on a second server
or a third server in Stanton System’.
That’s not the way Stanton’s going to
work.
It’s going to be very dynamic and we’ll
actually have, say you start with one server
and people fly around it can be anywhere in
Stanton just like what you can do right now
in Crusader, but then as you go beyond the
cap say, just for simplicity’s sake, say
we can run fifty people on a server right?
So thirty people, forty people they’re all
running around Stanton doing their stuff no
problem, AI’s are doing their stuff.
But now a whole new bunch of people come in
and we move from thirty people to sixty people.
Well ok that’s more than we can fit on one
server so at that point we will always have
one probably server ticking over ready and
you keep one as a buffer.
So we’ll say “Ok we’ve got more than
we can fit on one server”.
So we migrate players to whichever server
is appropriate and we just arbitrarily go
“Ok well there’s a clump of players over
here so this server will take care of them.
There’s a clump over here and this server
will take care of them”.
Both these servers have full global view of
the whole star system, these servers also
talk to each other as well as the clients.
The server essentially responsible for say
simulating the entities that its authoritative
of.
But it will also tell the other server if
the other server needs to know what the entity
that this server did with.
So basically that’s what edge case is.
So it’s like ‘ok i’m updating these
people but there’s one guy over here that’s
coming towards you and you’ve got a guy
over here’.
So this server’s saying “Oh this is where
this guy is”.
So this server knows and has a copy of him
in his memory space and vice versa so you
can just basically resolve overlaps between
server control areas.
So that’s kind of the aim.
The idea is as more and more people come in
you spin up more and more servers and they
all mesh together so you can ultimately have
hundreds if not thousands of people essentially
all in the same instance.
Then your real limitation is more about the
client and what the client can render and
see on its side.
That’s kind of the plan which is a more
dynamic and actually a more advanced than
I think ultimately better solution than what
we talked before which was much more instance
on top of each other and you can only ever
see thirty other people or fifty other people
or whatever it would be.
I think that it’s going to be good, so that’s
what we’re working towards.
There will probably be some cases where there
will just be too many people.
I can see in a landing area where there’s
maybe a thousand people hanging around the
landing area.
We just won’t be able to have a thousand
people.
A hundred people will get together or five
hundred say “Let’s go to the courtyard”.
Well on a client you just can’t render five
hundred people.
It just won’t happen.
So what we’ll probably do besides having
aggressive LOD’s at some point, you just
cull out people beyond a certain area.
But they’ll all be tagged and known there
as you move around as client people will come
in and out of your visibility basically.
Your sphere of visibility.
I think it will seem pretty seamless.
On top of that getting down to your friends
which is one of the key parts of this question.
We will know who are your acquaintances, who
you’ve tagged as your person of interest,
who you play, who is on your friends list,
stuff like that.
So if you’re making decisions of who you
can see, at some point if there’s too many
people in the client will think “I just
can’t render this many people I have to
choose some entities or people to not see”.
It would not be the people you as a player
have tagged as your friends or that you’re
interested in.
So they would get preference in terms of the
algorithm that determines who you see or who
is culled out and who isn’t culled out.
I think it’s going to be pretty cool.
So you should be able to hang out and work
with your friends.
I think the only issues we’re going to get,
which will happen ‘cause we have some pretty
massive organisation, there is no way we can
possibly have one of those massive thousand
people in a space battle setups.
But I do think we will probably able to get
like quite a few hundred people doing that
which will be pretty cool.
But i’m sure you guys will figure out ways
to break it but you know that’s what it
is.
I think it will be a pretty cool experience.
I am actually pretty excited by the tech that
we’re working for this, it’s not going
to happen overnight, it’s going to take
a lot of time because we’re building something
that’s really, we’re right on the cutting
edge of this kind of stuff, there’s a few
other projects that are doing similar stuff,
using the cloud architecture to dynamically
scale and process much more on bigger denser
worlds that you could do on a single server
or single client which is what we’re doing,
but I think it’s the future and I think
it’s going to be pretty cool.
[24:49] KuruptU4Fun 1 asks: In the new Jump
Point there is mention of an update that will
bring the ability to lower your wanted level
by hacking a console.
There will also be a need to defend it while
that hack completes.
What portions of FPS will need to be finalized
and implemented for that update?
Well nothing really: that’s all in 2.2.
So what we’re doing, I think I’ve mentioned
this quite a few times, is on the FPS side
we have a whole bunch of features and weapons
that we’re just methodically going through
and enabling.
A lot of it is content related: so getting
the animations polished before we feel like
they are ready for everyone to see or use,
and the same on the assets.
And some of it is making some of the mechanics
work or move a little better.
So we’ve got things vaulting, like going
vaulting over obstacles and stuff, that isn’t
going to be in 2.2 but it will be in 2.3 for
instance.
And so what we’ve been doing is knocking
off the cover mechanic; things like prone
or crouching; and various things in 2.2.
We have physicalised EVA which is actually
really cool, you get a real sense of inertia,
you have to be a bit more wary in tight areas
because we’re actually properly simulating
so it is like flying around a spaceship in
a tight area, you don’t really want to bang
up against things because it will give you
a bit of an impulse.
But when you get it down I think it cooler
and more exhilarating and we’ll be adding
more and more things that will make that cooler.
So that’s just our plan: we’re continually
adding more and more functionality to FPS.
Our goal is the FPS is going to be very comparative
to to other FPS’s out there that have a
whole bunch of cool detail and accuracy.
So we’re not really aiming to be a simplified
‘run and gun’ shooter we’re actually
aiming to be much more tactical and considered,
and have that reflect in a lot of the FPS
mechanics.
So there will be a lot of options and things
you can do, and stances, and actions, and
ultimately it will have the ability to do
parkour with sliding and vaulting over stuff
and ledge grabbing and all of the rest of
the stuff.
So that’s all on the roadmap.
We’ve captured animations for all of it.
We’re slowly churning through the thousands
of animations and hooking it up and making
sure the animation blending works and all
the various things you have to worry about
to make it work well.
But I’m pretty confident that when it’s
all said and done it will be actually pretty
damn cool.
[27:29] NARCoMAN asks: Since Corvettes fill
a role between capital and sub-capital ships,
should we expect the upcoming ship or other
Corvettes to be more versatile or more economical?
So, you definitely should expect it to be
more economical.
I don’t know if it’s more versatile cause
to be honest with you the Idris, for the money
it packs a punch.
It’s a mini carrier plus it can go toe to
toe with other capital ships, like has massive
living quarters and everything like that.
We’re sorta planning that the proper corvette
we do will be about 100 meters or so and it’ll
be more focused on… let’s put it this
way, it’s not going to be a massive carrier.
Obviously you’ll be able to dock a ship
and do all the rest of the stuff and certainly
can hold it’s own fighting some fighters
and bigger ships and quite a few of them would
cause of problem for a bigger ship like a
frigate or a destroyer and all that stuff.
It should also be easier to control and command
cause the Idris is just huge, I mean I think
you’ve seen some of the stuff we’ve shown
for it and it’s just massive.
It’s probably not going to be a viable ship
for one person to or even one person and a
few of his friends to sort of command.
The Idris is going to require quite a few
players to man it in unison, which I think
will be really satisfying once all that happens
and definitely some NPCs helping you out.
So, the corvette I think will be just more
manageable.
[29:07] Syntax asks: What is the end vision
for planetary ship entry?
I would love to see a requirement for a crew
to analyze various aspects such as atmospheric
pressure, composition, etc, that facilitates
an active participation from the crew to determine
the best mode of entry.
Well, we haven’t actually fleshed this out.
We do have plans for sort of atmospheric entry
and atmospheric flight, we all kind of want
to do... if you seen Prometheus, the sort
of Prometheus entry down onto the planet or
if you go back to Aliens they had a very cool…
well, the effects aren’t as nice as in Prometheus
but going through the storm and you know the
clouds and the turbulence.
So, we definitely want that depending on the
kind of planet, potentially a planet you could
go down and find minerals and strip and gather
resources that you could sell for a lot of
money.
It should perhaps be quite dangerous to get
down there and maybe you have to figure out
how to get down there without getting caught
up in huge storms or the rest of the stuff.
So, we want to make that part of the future,
we’ve been discussing it and obviously John
Pritchett, our flight guru, so we’ve already
been going back and forth on some of that.
Of course, we have quite a few other things
to do but we are planning sort of clouds on
planets and weather systems and all the rest
of the stuff so we’ll definitely ultimately
have that and I think it will be a pretty
cool experience.
It won’t be any time in the near future
but it’s definitely something we are planning
and I don’t know if you necessarily go to
a full length scientific analysis but there
will be certain kinds of planets that will
be more dangerous to enter and will require
some skill to enter but I think there will
be rewards if you get down there.
Maybe some of you won’t be able to scan
from a distance without getting through the
cloud layer or something like that.
So, there you go.
Outro
All right, so that’s the end of this 10
for the Chairman, thank you for sitting here
and listening to me.
Thank you everybody out there that has backed
Star Citizen, I’m constantly amazed that
we’ve got this amazing community and this
year is going to be great.
Really quite excited because we finally got
the team in sort of at a critical mass point
where we have enough people where we can be
fully cranking on all the aspects at the same
time and really delivering a lot of content
which is quite different than last year where
we sort of weren’t able to consistently
deliver content.
So, this year we’re going to be making really
consistent updates and progress on the big
Persistent Universe and obviously we’re
doing the same on Squadron 42.
It’s all because of you guys, you guys are
supporting us and enabling us to build a game
no publisher would ever build in their right
mind and I think we’re building a game that
the PC crowd around the world and space sim
fans around the world can look at and go,
‘wow, this is incredible’.
We’re super proud so thank you and thank
you to subscribers for kicking in the extra
money to sort of fund our ability to do this
additional content for everyone to keep people
informed and I will talk to
you next week, thanks.
Bye.
