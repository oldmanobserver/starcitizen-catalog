Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome to
Bugsmashers.
Let’s check out a bug.
Hey everyone, we’re here in the fancy dancy
FPS test map and we got a fun bug where sometimes
this new vault tech, where you can jump over
these ledges just brings you way up into the
air.
Fun bug, now the tech is still getting worked
on and I am missing some animations so you’re
going to see some wonkiness but this is behind
the scenes, you get to see the stuff we’re
working on and let’s see if we can replicate
that fun bug where if I vault over this I
get shot up way into the air.
So, let’s see… oh, there it goes, good
times.
Now I’m in space… so I vault over a ledge,
end up in space and suffocate because I have
no air.
That’s the best way to play this game, right?
Excellent, so what’s happening.
Well we have this fun bit of logic here that
tries to find the ground position so when
you hop over it can basically know where you’re
at and unfortunately there’s a couple issues
here.
One, we’re using the world position and
if we’re in a zone, like in a grid of a
ship or something like that this will mess
up totally because it’s not taking into
account inside of that grid space.
It’s a world position so it’ll reorientate
us wrongly because basically all the player
code assumes zone position.
Another issue is we’re getting the result
of this water test to see how far down we
are, problem is we’re in this vault code
and this test may have not have happened or
it has very bad data, it’s not going to
be anywise good.
Sometimes it will gives us good hopping over,
sometimes it’ll have some bad information.
So, what we want to do instead is use the
zone position and send off our own ray trace
downward relative to us to see where the ground
actually is.
If there is really ground, otherwise if we
don’t hit anything, we just use the player
position where ever the animation leads us
in the hop over.
So, let’s hit recode.
All right, recode is finished… let’s see
what happens now if we try to vault over.
Woo, kind of teleport in the air but that’s
another bug, I’m also missing some animations
but the good thing is, woah, I’m no longer
instantly teleporting up into the air.
Obviously this is still a work in progress
feature and that’s why we want to show you
some fun new things that we’re working on
but by the time you get this you’ll be able
to hop over those ledges smoothly.
At least for now we’ve resolved the issue
of you teleporting into oblivion, the next
thing is to smooth out the real jumping and
you can ignore the debug text on the bottom.
It’s out debugging for internal use but
hope you guys enjoyed, til next time.
Pew, pew, pew...let’s kill the player, yeeeaaahhh
dead.
Dead’s awesome.
All right so you guys saw a fun little bug,
you run all the way over, you see an awesome
ledge and be like, ‘I’m going to jump
over’ but instead of going down you go way
up into oblivion.
That’s a little bug we didn’t want to
get released when Star Marine’s all ready
so we took care of it before you guys got
a hold of it.
Hope you guys enjoyed, till next time.
