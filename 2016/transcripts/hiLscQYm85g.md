hey everybody uh welcome to reverse the
verse it is Friday September 30th 20 16
I'm your host Community manager Jared
hucke uh if you've never seen reverse
the verse before reverse the verse is
clad Imperium games Community teams
weekly informal live stream with the
fans uh basically we're going to follow
up on a lot of the cool stuff that you
saw on around the burst which is our
Flagship broadcast every Thursday and uh
we're going to follow that up by talking
to some of the developers that you saw
on the show yesterday uh in this case
what the big big uh uh feature on last
week's on last week's show on
yesterday's show was was the flight
balance the flight model changes so we
have two guests from Foundry 42 UK to
talk about those changes with us uh Mr
Johnny javious uh tech technical
designer and Mr Andrew Nicholson how you
guys doing good thanks jar how you doing
you good see so you guys are are
technical designers um why don't you
tell us a little bit about what that
entails what you guys do for star seison
and then what you're working on now you
know before we start taking questions
from do you want to start or should I I
think you should Johnny you're the more
experienced Technic designer okay you've
been around a more traditional Tech
designer okay so we a lot of what we do
is pretty much everything centered
around ships so we'll be involved from
even the concept stage uh where we get a
ship idea and we kind of work with the
concept artists and people like BN and
the writers and everyone to make sure
we're all getting what we want um and we
can kind of spot any technical issues we
can see early down the line if things
aren't going to fit like the notom
metric or something like that um then
once we actually start getting the art
in that's when we start actually piecing
it together and uh making things work
putting engines on the ships making sure
the flight is bounced
properly uh putting all the weapons on
making all the seats work anything that
you can see that moves or shoots or you
know fires any VFX that's going to
involve some setup from us so that's
kind of the main stay of what tech
designers do here um yeah since I think
Johnny is more tradition Tech designer
who's more about the setup and stuff so
where I come in is uh someone who isn't
traditional but is totally involved in
the process
because is the um like like Johnny says
that the tuning of the flight and those
those weapons that go on the ships
making sure that they are not totally
skewed or op or whatever that's where I
come in got so all those weeks when we
have artists on the show and people are
like why does this ship do this why does
this ship do that and like those aren't
the people to ask we now have the people
to
ask so what have you guys been Johnny's
the one to ask Johnny is the one to ask
I'm the M be so what what have you been
working on for Star Citizen
recently um recently um I've kind of
been dipping a little bit into not so
much system design but kind of partially
system design so kind of looking at our
missile and weapon systems
and um refactoring them in a way not in
a major way but just in a way that kind
makes things a little bit more
especially in the missiles case more
modifi modifiable on the ships uh and in
the case of weapons we'll we'll probably
get into that in a bit but it's kind of
tweaks to the weapons to make them feel
a bit more
unique okay okay and what have you been
working on Andrew yeah so when as Johnny
says tweaks to the weapons we've been
working kind of in tandem on the weapons
in the last week or so where firstly
been just defining the roles of these
weapons s and then you know working out
the ranges of all these different
factors speed uh lifetime the projectile
damage and then once we've got like the
ranges then you start putting them in
game and starting to see where it
doesn't fit where it's totally out um so
so I've been back and forth yeah back
and forth Excel sheets um getting into
game firing the shots going GH no that
doesn't look right oh yeah that feels
really good yeah there's a lot of
numbers changes a bit back and forth
between us both and a lot ofest thing as
well gotcha okay now we we talk about
when we talk about refactoring we talk
about you know remodels and stuff like
that this is a normal everyday process
for game development that's why what's
one of the reasons it's development not
construction it's you try things you see
how it works you know you make changes
you try another thing you see how it
works you make changes you know this
isn't this is this is normal this isn't
some some major oh we going to pull our
hair out kind of thing uh people see it
because that's one of the things that
separates Star Citizen from just about
every other video game project in the
world is that we're running a live
environment while we're in game
development so folks get to see this
process that that that happens in all
game development and it's it's exciting
but it can be you know confusing
sometimes for people you know why is
this changing why do why do things keep
changing and that's at the core of all
video game development so with that in
mind uh flight model balance flight
model change um let's explain that to
people let's explain what that is
exactly because it's when it's hard for
it's hard to always wrap your head
around what a flight model is so why
don't you why don't you tell us what a
flight model is and and what ex what
we're actually doing right now okay well
I think this is one of the things we
didn't clarify enough around the ver
segment this these aren't changes per se
to what what our flight model is which
is you know we we've got a very um
physics based which is real realistic as
much as it can be um we've not made any
changes to that really it's it's about
um
opening up some of the flight model to
designers to then change parameters of
the ship or ships uh so we can have or
easily modify the speeds of the ships
easily the stop times and rotations you
know it it's really taken what's there
already yeah with the model I mean to
explain the model it's yeah the the
model is the is the is the is the
algorithm it's it's the it's the program
it's the thing that takes all of the
numbers and crunches them and outputs
something the model itself is the same
we are changing the attributes that the
model you know uh uh interacts with
right we're just lowly designers when it
comes to that I mean we've got the the
physics engineer who is the the
professor who made that we're just it
making the the ships fow different ways
to see what is better what's identify
you know as you say would doing this all
live and people can see it so it's a
it's kind of a unique process um but
it's it's it's a fun one I think yeah I
mean feedback we try and get a lot of
the testing out of the way here so we're
not pushing and pulling people like too
much like it's a bit confusing when
you're playing a game and everything
completely changes then it'll change
back again then it'll change again and
obviously that's part of the fun but I
think after a while people have start to
get sick of it especially the amount we
change in studio here so it's always
good to go through that refinement
process before we get all of the new
numbers out to backers got you yeah so
the so the model is the same that that's
that that was the biggest confusion from
ATB we haven't changed the flight model
we're not changing the flight model the
work that John pritet and his team did
you know that's solid we're really happy
with that we're changing the attributes
the speed the the the the um
maneuverability the you know the damage
all that stuff you know what missiles do
what weapons do uh and stuff like that
so but the model itself the thing that
computes all of that and makes it into a
playable game that's that's the same so
untouched John you know that's
that's get every day gotta so we we'll
start in with some questions from the
fan fans right off the bat uh will the
new flight model again will the new
flight it's the same flight model be
different in Arena Commander than in the
Pu so will ships have handle differently
in Arena Commander than they will in the
Pu no that that wasn't the intention
everything will be this the same across
all modes yes um we want to I think
something we didn't have previously is
the is the cruise speeds in Arena
Commander
um so with the changes making things
slower um and if we make the arena
command areas bigger eventually we want
to we want to get Cru in there and and
have that as part of that game play uh
spawn points will obviously be really
important then M to see how it's going
to balance but yeah we'll have it the
same across yeah obviously while they're
kind of separate modules we don't want
to have too much of a disconnect between
the two otherwise it be super jarring
you know going from one flying sh and in
in one and then going to the other and
then thinking why can't I fly this same
way we considered the burner as well
Arena command as the arcade mode if if
we're going
to make make
fuel very consumable then why not
consider some kind of pickups or
something like that it it was talked
about we'll see if that comes in but
yeah it'll be mostly the same but
gamified yeah I mean ultimately what
arena Commander is supposed to be is it
is you know the instant test bed for
flight mechanics and stuff so it doesn't
it doesn't serve its purpose if it
Strays too far from what you do in the
Pu so all right another question from
the fans uh were different controller
setups taken into consideration with the
rebalance so when you guys are are
testing this stuff are you're not just
all you know uh hotas you're not just
all mouse and keyboard different folks
work with different controller schemes
abely yeah
um something from being in QA myself
it's like you need to make sure every
single device is is is tested when this
happens um my desk is covered in all
kinds of peripherals I don't know if you
saw them around the verse I had the
steering wheel yeah remember when I was
there in the office like I came right to
you and asked you about the the farming
the Farming Simulator tool yeah it's all
balanced around the steering wheel
sorry uh but yeah like we pretty much
everyone in even in the tech design
Department favors their own control
method we've got someone who pretty much
exclusively likes to play with a
controller we've got people who like
hotas and we've got people who love
mouse and keyboard so we get feedback
from everyone as we're these changes
anyway cuz they see them every day yeah
uh now one of the things we' talked
about is that the the flight speeds are
slowing down across the board you know
that's that's to make uh Chris talked
about it a bit in this hosting segment
uh it's to make you know combat more you
know immersive less jousting pass you
know let you you know follow your
targets and stuff um will missiles also
be slowed down question from one of our
fans yeah I think well because you still
you still have access to the the burner
speeds and really what we've done is is
have the sem speed so when you get into
situation you are moving slower we still
have uh the ships can still reach the
the other speeds you can still after bur
you can still cruise to get there um
it's something I'm going to have to play
test and get people to try because I
don't want it to be you escape from
these missiles too easy and we've had
that before where they don't have any
impact because you just all right I'm in
Cru and I'm gone now and we still don't
have the penalties for spooling up on
cruise uh on that side so um I think uh
they'll probably come down a bit because
we don't want people in sem to just be
bombarded by missiles the time but we'll
have to see on that all right uh another
question from the fans it seems like
there's barely 10 seconds of boost fuel
in some ships will boost or After Burner
be updated with these changes now this
was actually mentioned in ATB yesterday
uh we are making some changes to how
boost and After Burner work what can you
what can you say about that
okay um so yeah firstly we we definitely
want to give more fuel so that you've
got a prolonged use of the afterburn
because you want After Burner to be more
prominent and more important in a in a
combat situation if you have it if you
have the fuel um so we'll probably give
it more less of a less of a draw rate
and then a slow climb back up
um sorry what was the what was the other
part on changes to boost and After
Burner will will we we be adjusting
their their fuel balance the answer was
yes yes yes sorry I thought second after
After Burner is kind has kind of Fallen
to the side you know in in in recent
months and what not so so a lot of these
changes will are to make After Burner a
more attractive option another option
that you you should use in dog fighting
so yeah the answer is yes we'll be
giving more fuel for not or more fuel or
tweaking the amount of fuel After Burner
actually Burns you know yeah so we won't
as fast yeah okay um another question
with fans have these changes trickled
down or impacted uh any larger ships
like Capital like like uh the Edris or
the javelin um people are excited about
you know Capital ships eventually coming
online uh do do do these changes affect
those at
all um not so much because of the the
sheer mass of the ships when we've when
we've had these ships flying
it's always been let's push it to the
Very extreme of how long the longest
acceleration the slowest rotation uh
speeds so so not much really has changed
there you'll still it's still a case of
it's moving a big Juggernaut through
space and it feels like a like like that
should so it hasn't really affected them
too much okay uh do these new speeds
affect blackout or red out
thresholds no um
they'll still be kind of where they were
I mean after burner covers that top area
so if you're after burning a lot you
still have the same risk of blacking out
if you're pushing it to its limits got
so that won have come in we have
um talked about that a bit I mean just
bringing the speeds down makes it less
likely you're going to hit those
thresholds MH some people were expecting
us to bring the the thresholds down as
well that really was getting away from
us trying to make it um less of a chall
less of a challenge I'd say m like some
people had a great with me saying it was
simplifying the the flying model as well
but really it's not it's kind
of it's making it more playable really
yeah yeah it felt like the obvious
problems with what we had um so we're
tried to combat that yeah and again that
is this is a normal part of game
development we we're trying a thing
we'll get that get those changes out to
evocati and then we'll get those changes
out to The Wider PTU and then we'll get
those changes out to our live
environment which is absolutely still a
test environment All Star C environments
our test environments we will get
feedback from the smaller group then the
larger group and then the largest group
possible and you know if changes are
necessary after that we'll make those
changes too I mean these changes are
made because of feedback from the fans
so you know that's that's the process so
nothing nothing is final nothing is is
set in stone this is the next thing that
we experimenting with that we're trying
with so we're excited to get it into
folks hands so one more question then we
we get we have uh we have our next guest
here let's see what do we got here
um uh okay so not just missiles how will
weapons ranges be adjusted on the new
flight
model so uh weapon ranges in general are
going to change on a per weapon basis so
uh we've kind of split weapons into
bands a bit more now cuz we found that
the weapons we had all had a very
similar r R they had very similar fire
rates even between cannons and
repeaters um with the exception probably
being gatlings cuz they fire quite a bit
faster but yeah uh range wise we're kind
of going with the approach that cannons
will be your long-range engagement
option so they will be increased from
kind of what the normal is repeaters
will probably meet somewhere in the
middle gatlings will probably be down at
the lower end so we've kind of split
those on a per weapon basis but you
could probably talk a bit more as to
kind of what the actual ranges are but
that again that's something that we're
kind of going back and forth on a lot at
the moment yeah like we're putting them
in game at the moment that's that's
totally what we're doing like today was
like putting these values in giving them
a test seeing if it's too far um Rangers
were coming down in in my mind I wanted
it to be like if the combat's slowing
bring the ranges in and see how that see
if that's beneficial to what we're
trying to get and that's what would
that's like that's what we're testing
right now um like Johnny says the
Cannon's still
around I don't know 45,000 range
possibly maybe closer and obviously
they'll get bigger as the gun gets
bigger as well CU especially when you
get start getting to bigger ships you'll
probably wanting to engage from further
distances yeah that that's me talking
like size five cannons mhm maybe their
maximums
um okay I don't know all right so so
we'll let you guys go uh everybody we're
going to play a short video and then
we're going to come back with uh lead
technical designer John crew master of
spaceships and uh will Maiden who who uh
working on the new UI systems so we'll
be back in just a minute wait for the
people
[Music]
and we're back uh W to part two of
reverse the verse uh with us now are is
lead technical designer Mr John crew and
uh technical designer uh Mr will Maiden
how you guys doing really well thank you
good so uh John uh we've had we've had
you on RTV before uh we had you on an
ATV segment a long time ago we did when
we did the very first starf tour if I
remember correctly yes that was like
record a huge amount
thank you for coming back uh well
um my first time yeah hey it's good good
to be finally on where the popular kids
are apparently yeah yeah I've done a
couple of ATVs but this is my first time
doing this this is good fun well thanks
for coming on all right so uh we uh
Johnny and uh Andrew already took us
through you know what what tech
designers do and stuff like this uh will
why don't you why don't you start by
telling us why you're trying to change
the game Into Golf citizen
well like it felt like there could be
more Fairways so more relaxing uh at the
club with a mix master no why don't you
start by telling us uh what what what uh
what are you working on for Star say and
uh what your scope of work right now uh
right now um I did a I've just been
looking at cargo the last couple of
weeks um and radar and scanning most
recently I talked about it yesterday on
around the verse um just before that I
was designing the Taren um so I was
doing the Q&A for that when it uh when
it went on sale um but keeping an eye on
that Bea of a ship but that's all kind
of because it's an exploration ship and
my work on radar and scanning it's all
kind of come together now um so
hopefully I'll be looking at exploration
and um that kind of data Gathering all
right and John what are you working
on I don't know everything changes so
quickly uh so at the moment we're
obviously doing cicon stuff we got quite
a few interesting stuff things to show
there uh we're looking to do star Marine
stuff 2 six balance changes it's just
sort of leading the team that we have
here which is quite large now so it's
it's gone from just being me to eight of
us in the last two years or so so lots
of stuff to keep track of lots of stuff
to do all right so we will jump right
into the fan questions uh so right off
the bat and as anticipated the very
first question
at at the is is uh it seems a lot of
people don't agree with the golf swing
style of scanning can you go into detail
on the thought process that went into
this
decision okay so just to clear the a
really the the golfs the golf swing um
is totally a first pass implementation
um the thinking here is that we want a
way of exposing hidden ships you've got
a ship that's say it's a saber and it's
running quiet and it's out there and you
want to find it you'll charge a pulse
and you'll release it and all of a
sudden that pulse will agitate the
signatur is being given off by that ship
and all of a sudden aha I found you for
like five six seconds or something and
then it fades away so we need some
gameplay there
where uh the hunting ship can expose The
Hiding ship so this this this the system
that you've seen yesterday is totally a
first pass um
what we're looking at having is a system
that essentially is going to build the
energy that you're putting into a uh
into the radar and over time that's
going to build and build and build and
build and build and the longer you hold
it the more power it's going to generate
the more it's going to expose The Wider
it's going to fetch uh information
from but with that comes a risk of I'm
going to push my luck too long and it's
going to blow up in my face so we want a
system that you can fail something that
you can really screw up and all of a
sudden you're not you thought you were
the hunter but now you've just blown
your radar out you can't see for the
next two minutes while you're trying to
cool it down oh my God this power going
to the wrong places everything's on fire
um it gives that time that ship time to
escape aha so we wanted we wanted a we
want a system where it's not it's not a
done deal you don't just press ping and
everyone becomes available yeah it's
something that you've got to really try
to to get right and now this you said
this is the first implementation now
that's one of the things that separates
star system from other projects is that
we are showing the first implementations
of systems that will iterate and
continue to change uh this is also uh
the first implementation of a of a
non-combat system on a combat ship this
is this is how scanning this is the
first impation implementation of how
scanning will work on a combat ship you
know on a dog fighter but that's not
necessarily you know how scanning will
work you know when you're on a Cru
station on a constellation or how
scanning will work when you're in a
cruise station on an nid why don't you
talk to to us about about that that's
absolutely right so when you're in a
single CER you control everything um you
control the scanning the radar as well
as the guns and and everything else so
there's a lot to do so we simplify what
you've got to do or we we don't give you
everything that say if you were the man
at a or a woman at a station on a cap
ship and your job is to find the sneaky
ships that are out there find the life
support of some guy who's ejected and
you really need to find them before they
die you know if that's your job um we're
going to give you so much more tools for
that um we've seen it with the terapin
there's a utility mountain and a
separate scanning station their job will
be uh to use the tools but but for
combat ships you don't need that um and
the stuff we shown we just have a lot of
combat ships right now so that's where
our Focus has been it's like what's a
very simple approachable system that
combat Pilots can use and then that we
can build on that for the exploration
and the bounty hunting uh in the future
exactly a lot of people are worried that
that's it just going be sat at the
station on the addess yeah pressing the
button that is literally the very first
yeah and we're looking at things like
I've seen some some really cool
suggestions on the forums um uh and
internally as well people have have
suggested justed cool things about being
able to scan Way Beyond you know it's
like looking with a radio telescope at
far beyond Stars this idea of of using
long range sensors to to see beyond your
limits the radar is just what's around
you um we've got much more exciting
plans for for long range centers and uh
sensors uh that are going to gather this
data that regular equipment just can't
pick up awesome awesome so we've we've
basically shown just the earliest
Glimpse small you know implementation of
a much larger system and that's
something that's only really been
possible lately because we've got item
2.0 coming through so we can finally
start to have uh systemically generated
uh signatures from ships when you put
something in that runs hotter it's going
to generate more infrared if you put
something in that's drawing more power
it's going to generate more um
electromagnetic fields so before we just
had a a Boolean system of you can either
detect them or you can't and now we're
getting into these shades of gray where
maybe you can detect them maybe if I put
a bit more of a pulse out maybe I can
find you so it's only in the last couple
of weeks really that we've started to to
see this stuff come online and then
we've been able to put this first pass
in to say how does this play and then
internally and getting some feedback and
so it's a it's a gradual process but
it's only really started in Earnest
lately yeah so it sounds like you know
when when this is fully implemented
it'll take a measure of finesse you know
to actually get the best results because
you're not just going to want to send
out the biggest baddest pul every time
because you know it's like active sonar
you're going to let them know where
you're at yeah exactly and it's a
two-sided thing where the guy being
hunted may maybe doesn't know where the
guy hunting him is and like submarine
warfare has been a big a big influence
in how this kind of stuff works out and
so if you ping you give yourself away um
but if you do it right then the guy's
exposed and but if you do it wrong it
it's going to backfire on you so and
yeah things like when you charge this
pulse it's going to leave you exposed
your radar is going to disappear because
all your power is going to charging the
pulse so all of a sudden you're blind
and so and that's that's that's
terrifying if if you're relying on that
to find this guy that's out there and
you're charging all of a sudden your
your sent it goes black because all the
power is going into to building and
building and building and building and
then when you release it and if you
release it wrong you not only you're
blind but you've sent out a big flare
saying I'm here and now I've screwed up
royally now I am very exposed and very
weak gotta and item 2.0 going back to
that really helps with getting lots of
seats talking to lots of items all
together we can do it at the moment but
anyone that's played a lot of multi crew
stuff you sort of Hit the limitations
very quickly where this person is trying
to do this they can't really influence
what this other person's in charge of
but the item two set up in all the ships
really allows one person to talk to two
items that another person in another
seat is has control over it properly
prioritizes it so a lot of systemic
gameplay will come out of that very
easily which we've been struggling with
a long time and it's finally going to
get there it's the whole why can't I
slave my turret to the pilot seat that's
exactly the sort of stuff that will come
straight out of this it's almost
here all right another question from the
fans uh we sort of touched on this how
will stealth ECM and anti-an devices
work with scanning are we ready to talk
about that a little bit so to start with
stealth um obviously uh we we covered
this a bit on the ATV but if you didn't
see we're looking at in space at least
um infrared electromagnetic and
cross-section as these are the
signatures that are going to make you
visible to other people so how
physically large your ship is is going
to be a factor in that now maybe we've
got some um some hole plating or maybe
sorry maybe you've got some whole
plating which will even though you're a
big ship it's it's not quite visible or
it it disguises against the background
so you can't pick it up um same with uh
heat masking uh your your equipment so
it doesn't produce as much heat same
with power drawer obviously buying um
the specific items that we will make
that were are tailored for stealth so
they run deliberately quiet um in one
way or another but maybe they don't you
know pack the biggest punch so you could
have some stealth uh power plants that
have a really low em feel because
they're hardened but they don't put out
as much power as you'd like so you can't
run everything at full whack um so when
you come to kitting out your ship you'll
be looking at at signatures will be a
very big part of okay this does a lot of
good stuff but it's also very loud so
what's the tradeoff there what do I want
to buy that's going to help me complete
my mission do I want to be detected or
do I want to really suck it to them um
so stealth is going to be is is going to
be all kind of driven by the the items
um well driven by some of the items um
and then for what was the ew war did you
say or ECM anti- scan stuff like that is
oh anti- scan yes so when you actually
get a contact uh and there there's a
separation before we had the ra the
scanner was kind of this one big it's
everything it's radar and scanning and
we've separated them lately so that the
radar detects contacts um and the
scanner allows you to get information
from it so as long as you can see that
contact you can draw information out
which is why St saying quiet is so
important um but once I've got you and I
can start scanning and there's a I think
you saw kind of briefly a little
progress bar that's going to start
bringing information through um we're
going to allow you to place item sub
items on those items that'll be
hardening so it takes it takes longer to
scan that individual item so if you
really don't want them to know about
your cargo container or the abilities of
your guns you can stick additional
upgrades onto those that will that will
harden them um whole plating will stop
will slow slow down the penetration of
scans shielding will um if you don't
want to be scanned you can hide behind
asteroids and things they'll break line
of sight and make it harder to scan um
so situational positional um things you
can do with just getting out of there um
also you need a Target you need to be
actually aiming at the guy so fly very
far away you're you're you're answering
a bunch of these questions that we have
hued up so there's like I don't need to
ask these ones cuz you're already
covering
um but we do have one question a very
serious question it appears if I am
scanned while on foot well running away
in a zigzag Serpentine pattern help me
uh well it depends who's scanning you if
there's a ship hovering above maybe not
um the the way scanning is going to work
is that if if I've got eyes on
you and you're dead centering my retical
I'm probably going to have a really easy
time scanning you if you if I don't move
and you run away that's going to take
long because you're further away from my
kind of line of the center M if I turn
to keep keep my track on you then you
can run all day and you just be scammed
tired but then yeah totally hide behind
things get things in the way um it's the
the trick there is to be not be
uh well not be predictable but not be
seen in the first place um and then it's
then it's all about well hardening the
gear that you have to make it harder to
see what you've got because they might
scan you and they say hey you're Jeff
and you're over there but you've got a
gun but my sensors can't actually tell
what your gun is right away um and I
can't actually tell if you've got a
criminal record because I I don't have a
chip on my computer that speaks to the
police database or something so there
are ways you can get around being scan
but a zigzag maneuver is probably you
you're probably better off just
attacking the guy that's scanning you I
however there's there's a possibility
sorry to jump in no go ahead of of not
being able to know you're being scanned
in the first place so if I've got a
really good
scanner um and I'm scanning you I could
be scanning you all day and you don't
even know that I've I can see you over
there um but likewise if you're really
paranoid about being scanned maybe
you've got some gear on your comp on on
your on your ship that's incredibly
sensitive so it's the second it detects
you're being scammed you're being
scammed to bought Oh I thought I was
alone out here so you know if you if
you're smuggling let's say and you've
got a cargo full of illegal spice and
you're running to the border and all of
a sudden you're being scanned like eject
get rid of that stuff but uh and so you
may be less worried about them seeing it
and more worried about being able to
detect if you're being scanned in the
first place because with one of the one
of the goals of ships like the terapin
this uh this scout these these ships
that can surveil other ships is that
they might jump in stay super far back
and just observe the whole Fleet and
scan everyone without them even knowing
they've been scanned in the first place
and then leave and sell all that good
good information so if you've got some
Secrets maybe you've got some scan
detection on board as well not to self
don't ask Will joke questions he'll take
them
seriously everything's serious no it's
good thank you the answer the answer was
better um another question for the fans
can you fake a larger em or
cross-section could a a small ship
pretend to be a larger ship you know to
to to to throw people off just maybe to
scare people cross-sections probably a
lot harder to do um because it is
physical size you could do it with a bit
of chaff might help there em is
definitely possible there's um a lot of
the items have pools that they fill up
that it's like their little mini backup
MH um and the EM signature is quite
often just a multiplier of how much
energy is in those pools so if you empty
them and then quickly refill them and
keep doing that you're going to have
this pulsing Big Em signature that's
going to lure people in um same with i
al though that's more of a component of
heat so it's going to take longer for
the coolers to get rid of it than it is
for a power plant to if you turn your
shields on and off they're the Shields
and your power plant are the two biggest
em contributors so if you're sitting
there toggling them like crazy you're
going to be lit up like a Christmas tree
for whatever reason you want to do that
for it' be interesting to see how
players manipulate that system to asz
you know if you're a cross-section you
know maybe they've got stealth plating
or something so if you're seeing a
larger em you're seeing a larger you
know IR SE signature but a smaller
cross-section it's like well maybe you
know they they've got stealth plating
you know it could still be a larger
ship another thing about cross-section
is it is actually three-dimensional the
signature that we have in game so if
you're looking at a saber on got it
looks tiny but if it just rolls it's
suddenly a much larger signature well
relatively larger sa small anyway but it
is worked out in real time based on the
angle you're at actually now now I'm
imagining Idris Pilots because Idris is
so wide you know but not necessarily so
tall you know flying flying
perpendicular so then you've got to
consider if you're if you see a ship and
that's got you you don't want to just
turn and BK
dis you want to slowly rotate and keep
the thinnest side possible so especially
if it's got lots of thrusters on the top
and bottom because as soon as you do
that massive cross-section Thruster
you've got all your IR emissions coming
out from the maneuvering thrusters you
Noy
mistake uh how does scanning work with
other objects uh besides ships like
asteroids and and and stuff well
obviously asteroids have got a huge
cross-section so they've kind of got
built-in size um already uh stars and
things will have heat uh so you'll
already be able to detect them and then
it's just a case
of getting them lined up and scanning
and see what's on board and so you'll
you'll find information um the same way
that if you scan a ship and you find out
its load out of of guns and who's on
board and cargo what have you you'll
look at a you look at an asteroid and
you'll scan it and if you know if you've
not got anything if you're at a fighter
and you've just got your standard
scanner you'll see
it's a rocky
asteroid but if you install yourself a
mining scanning upgrade if you install
yourself an expiration scanning upgrade
all of a sudden it's like oh I'm getting
all these signals and I know what they
are because this is a mineral and this
is some gas gotcha so you'll be able to
for a little extra like you'll
specialize in your ship I want it to be
I'm going to set this up ship up to
be uh scanning asteroids so you bring
your mining gear you've got a mining
laser let's say you let's say you're in
the prospector and you're just scanning
Asteroids for
days and then it just starts to tell you
instead of what guns and cargo it's got
on board it's got
110,000 units of Steel oh you can't mind
steel coal or whatever or diamonds gold
um or there's some gas giants and here's
some pockets of hydrogen that you can
start to extract you have like three
ships at the same asteroid you could
have a freelancer a Carrick and a
prospector all there side by side
looking at this rock and the freelancer
it's a rock it's this big it weighs this
much the Carrick knows a bit more it's
got the extra scanners it knows what to
do it's like oh this composition of
stuff the prospector's got that and then
it goes this is where the good stuff is
here I'm going to go over here
and those specialized ships com with
those things by default but you can
always take you could take your Aurora
and you could put the mining scanner in
it and whilst it might not do you a
great deal of good because you won't be
able to put like mining lasers on it to
get everything out you'll be able to go
I went here I found this mining laser
I'm going to go back there in my
prospector or tell my buddy with the
prospector exactly this is where this is
that's a good point to make and and it
even goes back to the previous uh
conversation about the the the the
flight balance changes you know these
these are all the default loadouts of
these ships you will be able to swap out
components left and right from you know
engines to power plants to that will
allow you to change the flight the
flight charact not just the flight
characteristics but the you know the
things like the scanning characteristics
um so I mean what people have now are
all default loadouts you know when the
component system is fully online in in
all of its scope and Glory you know
people are going to be able it's it's an
aurora that will is flying may handle
very differently from an aurora that
that that John kits out you know that's
an exciting aspect of Star Citizen um
when you talk about the different
scanners the different types of scanners
um are there also different res will
there is there any talk about different
resolutions like are there some scanners
that if you had three ships in close
proximity they would look like one
because it's a low res and if you got a
better quality scanner that you would
actually be able to tell their three
separate
ships so we've got um
we've got the ability where if you're
near something that is also very hot if
you're hiding by a sun I wouldn't
recommend you do that but if you are
hiding by the sun it's um IR generation
is going to absolutely obscure this
little ships um so that's a place you
could hide but yeah if you've got a if
you've got a military grade top of the
line can see the heat signature of an
wasp on the back of your hand kind of
thing um from a million miles away then
it's absolutely possible that um when we
when we when you're looking at that
thing it can say no no no that's two
separate things and let me tell you why
um because yeah you could have a huge
ball of heat and then a little ship
that's hiding next to it that's actually
a lot cooler so maybe it shows up as
something separate it's not something
we've got in the immediate future to be
implemented but it's something that we
definitely need to look at like why
would I buy this scan when I could buy
that scan it's like okay well maybe you
can Spot the Difference and you know
find two needles in a Hy stack and see
that they're two separate things awesome
uh this might have been covered by the
uh item 2.0 stuff you were talking about
earlier John uh how is scanning going to
work within a party well like like on
the capital ship you know with the more
robust scanning system will the scanner
be able to share his or their results
with other players on the ship or even
other players in other
ships definitely within their ship and I
quite easily imagine it would be if you
say you're in the same party mhm for
sure um I don't think we've fully locked
down how we this be a good question for
what people working on the herald for
data sharing which might uh you might be
able to talk yeah we've been we've been
talking to uh Matt Sherman because he's
looking at the moment actually in fact I
spoke to him yesterday about it um this
idea of transmitting information between
ships um and obviously he can go into it
a lot more detail than I can um but
players want to be able to and we want
to be able to enable players to share
information transmit that um immediately
I would like to be able to um if I'm in
a party with John and I'm over here and
my radar is covering this area and he's
over there and he's covering that area I
want to be able to see what he picks up
and he sees what I pick up now maybe
there's a delay on that um so there's a
guy with a Herald who's listening in and
he's like oh that's interesting um
because that information that's being
transmitted I'm getting all your
scandate I'm getting all your scandate
sitting in my computer now and I can
sell that before you manage to complete
your SC like you're going asteroid to
asteroid looking for gold you find gold
he's like we found gold you're like bye
goes off and sells it before you've
managed to stake a claim so we want to
be able to share because that also opens
up all these opportunities to steal that
information um so that's so systemically
you could have lots of fun with that not
yourself don't group with will or me or
just someone there's a Herald nearby
that's not me you won't find anything
useful for me it I would just be
shooting everything all right
unbelievable we're we're just about time
here let me see if I can find one more
before we let you go here
um uh all right this I we I think we
already covered this but will scanners
have the same tier system as Weapons
coolers Etc whether there it be tier one
two three four
scanners yeah yeah yeah um I don't know
if we've talked a lot about this but we
have different
grades call it a grade to dgr and we
also have different categories so we
have military stealth uh industrial
civilian and competition and they they
each Excel in different areas so taking
shields for example um stealth obviously
they have less emissions but a lower
overall Shield health military is pretty
good but they have a high cost and they
have a lot of consumption to use
industrial have a high output but lots
of emissions civilians middle of the
range you have obviously you've got
multiple civilian manufacturers
different gr so you've got a huge
variance in there uh competitions what
we sort of lump racing well they're the
best of what they do yeah they're the
best of what they do so it's it's hard
to Define per item um so like
competition thrusters are great for
racing competition well depends what you
want to do with racing but yeah but it's
it's always it's always the best but
price or out be down yeah and that's
absolutely we want to use the same
system the same Universal system for
understanding how the scanning system is
going to work awesome uh well guys thank
you so much for taking the time today to
show up on RTV answer some questions um
I uh remember uh the stuff that you're
seeing on ATV each and every week you
know whether it's the scanning or
whether it's anything are the earliest
implementations of stuff we we are
taking stuff right off the presses now
and showing it to you you know in in
their earliest iterations because one of
the things we can do here at Star
Citizen with our with our open
development and crowdfunding and stuff
like that but they are by no means the
final implementations that we take the
opportunity to try things and we're
excited to try you know these new things
not the flight model the flight balance
changes the model is still the same
thank you John pritchet you know the
flight balance changes uh you know the
first implementation of of scanning in a
in a single dog fighter combat ship as
opposed to Capital ships so like that so
uh you know hit the forums hit the chat
hit the Reddit you know give us your
feedback when these systems come online
let us know what you think uh we'll
continue to iterate um uh this weekend
is twitchcon uh folks here at the
community team Tyler Ben and I were
heading down to San Diego uh shortly
after the finish of this broadcast so
we'll see you guys at at some of the
Gatherings there um and then next week
citizen con next week cing on guys um
there won't there won't there won't be
an ATV next week uh as usual the week of
a big event we're all all hands on deck
for the for the big reveal but tune back
in to Twitch on Friday and Saturday
we'll have some of our community
streamers uh WTF asaurus Captain Flint
uh Sergeant Gamble and Sophie girl will
be uh broadcasting on Friday and
Saturday from 12:00 to 6:00 Pacific uh
entertaining you with uh everything the
star s has to offer um I think my dad is
going to stop by he said it might happen
so watch for that if that happens hi Dad
hi Dad and then of course Sunday
Sunday's the big tamale citizen con
itself broadcast starts at 300 p.m.
there might be a pre-show before that
we're talk we got some ideas for
pre-show so maybe you want to tune in at
like 2:30 Pacific if that's if that's
your cup of tea but yeah so lots of
stuff coming on next week so we're
excited for everybody to see it um John
and uh and uh and um will and from
before Andrew and Johnny thanks again
guys uh thank you bye everybody I'm
going to
hit for
