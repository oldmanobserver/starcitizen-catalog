Darian Vorlick (DV): Hey everyone, welcome
to this next episode of 10 for the Developers.
I’m Darian Vorlick, Production Coordinator
here in CIG Los Angeles.
Kirk Tome (KT): And I’m Lead Technical Designer
Kirk Tome.
DV: So first we wanted to thank the subscribers
for being able to make content like this possible.
Without you we would not be able to put forward
such informational interviews and content
as such as this, so from us thank you guys,
KT: Thank you guys.
DV: So let's get started with the first question,
Kirk, you got one.
KT: Okay
[0:49] Far-seeker asks: Since you are working
on the Xi’an Scout, which from its initial
concept had a set of movable thrusters, can
you update us on the technology development
to support this, as well as any effect it
might have on other ships with rotating or
otherwise articulating main thrusters?
Specifically any comments on the Cutlass,
the Freelancer, and the Reliant, would be
deeply appreciated!
KT: Yes.
We can start to talk about that.
just to start on a few of the comments about
the Xi’an Scout which i’m currently implementing
for the hangar ready, in the hangar.
The actual name of the vehicle is the Aopoa
Khartu Al.
It is the manufacturer Aopoa’s conversion
of the Xi’an scout for human use.
It currently has a single seat and no ejection
capabilities.
I just want to put that out there.
We decided that for a light fighter of this
size the current single seat arrangement worked
best for it.
In the future we may have a variant of perhaps
another Aopoa manufactured seat that has multiple
seats but the current iteration of the Khartu
Al is single seater.
The thruster questions on here.
Yes, the Khartu Al will have four articulated
thrusters.
The thrusters themselves will orient themselves
to actually be able to complete a turn a turn
up to ninety degrees for the outer most axes.
Each of the thrusters themselves will include
the retro thrusters in the front so they’ll
be dual sided thrusters which will greatly
allow the Khartu Al to have a lot of maneuverability
so that the main thrusters can actually contribute
to horizontal and vertical thrust as well.
DV: Basically it’s vectored thrusting
KT: Right.
The way we’re going to do this, we’re
going to allow the main thrusters to contribute
to sideways thrust without actually animating
them as quickly as they need to provide that
thrust.
One issue what we had with the Cutlass, that
we still currently have with the Cutlass.
Is that having the large thrusters provide
thrust in the actual vector that are facing
makes the thrusters so that they’re really
floppy and so from the rear, when the Cutlass
is flying should we provide any type of vertical
thrust to provide stability for the ship.
We found that, they’re simply too floppy
and it just looks awful.
So the way to do this is to provide that thrust
and actually throttle the, speed at which
they rotate so that will have a ship that
has this type of nice, floaty motion without
having four long wings that simply flap in
the wind which will make it look awful.
So we’re still developing that and we will
of course have that available for the engine
and for future ships so that, that will become
available.
In the near time, we’re considering making
the Cutlass thrusters only rotate for VTOL.
The same is maybe true of the Freelancer that
way they still will have joint rotation without
that weird floppy animation.
Some other technology we will need to develop,
the Khartu Al is one of the first ships that
will have a landing and flying mode, which
are vastly different.
you’ll notice it is very folded up when
it’s landed and will expand out like a flower
when it’s in flight mode.
The same will be true for the Reliant.
So what we’ll do is, we’ll create states
for the ship; landed or in freeflight that
way the thrusters know how they’re going
to behave and will allow things like; turning
them off when it’s in landed mode or for
the Reliant because of the vertical orientation
of them.
We will know how these thrusters are supposed
to affect the ship because of those two states
that the ship is in
DV: Yeah, how does something like… we have
our Flight Engineer: John Pritchett, who works
on the ICFS and SCM how would does this change
what he needs to do as far as flight controls
are concerned.
KT: That’s a great question!
We would need to discuss with him how we would
need to signal the ship, so that it knows
which orientation its in.
I think that’s a simple variable in the
ship will determine when it’s not in landed
mode or when it’s in flight mode and then
John can then, recalculate what the actual
thrust from each of the thrusters, needs to
generate in order to maintain proper flight
based on that orientation of the ship.
DV: That is a mouthful!
KT: It’s a complicated ship!
[6:22] Andy Goodstar asks: Are alien races
treated as ‘one’ manufacturer each, or
are there different brans of Xi’an/Banu/Vanduul
ships?
What is specific signature of Xi’an Scout
manufacturer?
DV: I figure we would just tack this one on
since we were just discussing the Scout.
So right now Xi’an, Banu and Vanduul are
kind of their own, I don’t want to say brand,
but I guess species brand in themselves.
KT: Sure.
DV: We may in the future look to expand those
but at this moment we are looking at just
a single manufacturer.
That’s correct?
KT: Correct.
The Vanduul components were implemented as
Vanduul components.
The Xi’an components will not, they’ll
actually be … as we’re doing a component
refactor, the Xi’an components will be actual
manufacture components.
So we’ll have “human” components that
are on the ships so that you can upgrade them,
exchange them them out, etc.
In the future I think we will work with the
writers and then come up with the alien manufacturers,
each with their own components and capabilities.
So that we can do things like have Xi’an
specific components or whatnot.
For now we are currently going with the human
components.
DV: One of the things, if you guys actually
watched the 10 for the Developers with Sean
Tracy and Steve Bender, one of the things
they talked about was human-to-alien analog
components.
For example if a Vanduul is how X feet taller
than a human you don’t want a human wearing
a Vanduul t-shirt because it’s going to
be a lot bigger.
So we also have to take that into consideration
as far as when we create these alien manufacturers.
We can’t just take an alien t-shirt and
throw it on a human and say “hey we’re
done”.
We have to take into consideration if the
humans’ size are; that their dimensions
are; whether it is compatible with human ergonomics
at all.
So rather than just creating a bunch of alien
manufacturers we want to make sure it is something
that is realistic; that fits into the story;
and actually fits into the game mechanically
as well.
KT: Right and that’s a conversation for
the Khartu-Al: the control scheme are these
two spherical control components that humans
will put their hands on.
It’s just a prototype at the moment we’ll
refine how that actually works but the early
example of that was on the … what are the
Vanduul ships … the Scythe …
DV: And the Glaive.
KT: … and the Glavie.
They had their own custom UI that had an alien
flavour to it.
DV: Right.
KT: The same thing would be true for the Xi’an
type of ships.
DV: That’s why Zane, our UI guy, he put
static across the UI as if trying to show
that we are trying to translate alien technology
into human use.
So it’s still a little buggy in game, so
it was a little flavour to that.
KT: Yeah.
DV: But in the future we may expand it.
So you never know.
Speaking of components you had a components
question that I think nice tail into that.
KT: Yeah so there’s a three part question
here.
These came from Daz, Halbard and Tommytrain
(great name).
[9:40] Daz asks: In regards to the component
system can you discuss some of your recent
accomplishments with this.
Also do you expect we will be able to get
a component stats page similar to the ship
stats page we have now.
Have you considered adding a ship designer
page to the website so we can tune our builds
before committing?
Halbard asks: Will changing the components
of your ship have a noticeable effect on its
performance and capabilities?
Are there plans to have multiple viable upgrade
paths in order to prevent everyone gravitating
to a single build?
Are you considering a balancing mechanic for
upgrading so that improvements in one system
come at the expense of another?
Tommytrain asks: Aloha Devs, how are the gameplay
concepts of ‘modular components’ and ‘component
tuning’ materializing themselves in design
of the components for the latest and future
ships coming off the pipeline?
Are they interacting as these components become
real things, with size, shape, mass as well
as output forces/effects and corresponding
draws on the components which provide energy,
cooling, compute cycles?
KT: This is a big topic.
We are currently tackling each of the components
one system at a time.
I’m sure you’ve noticed that we’ve recently
just refactored the coolers that did involve
resizing the components because there will
be real components in the game, on the ships.
DV: Taking up volume.
KT: Yup, they’ll be size appropriate for
their capabilities, placed on ships, with
ships that have interiors such as the constellation
or the future Idiris or any of the larger
ships we will have access to them from the
interior so that when we implement damaging
gameplay, which were still designing at the
moment, you will be able to access them and
have a crew member run down the hall, go down
to the powerplant that has been damaged and
then actually repair that by access the component
from a panel say in the hall that contains
that particular component.
So there will be real physicalized items that
are in the game.
DV: Treat it a lot like Scotty from Star Trek
kind of thing where someone has to go down
a fix the shield generator or fix the warp
core or something like that.
KT: Exactly.
So if the engineer does notice that, “hey
we got the coolers damaged, now we don’t
have cooling on the right side of the ship.”
You can send the engineer down to physically
fix that component or perhaps even trade it
out for a brand new component and get back
instant access to the cooling capabilities
that you just lost.
DV: So just hope you don’t have to run a
whole kilometer length ship.
KT: Yes, So, that may be a possibility.
What does that entail?
Well we’re refactoring all of our component
so that we actually keep in mind the capabilities,
the positive and negatives of each of the
functions of that particular component.
Dave mentioned coolers so cooling capability,
power draw, signature, these are things that
are going to be integral for how the coolers
will work.
What we need to do then is get that system
in and then take a balance pass to figure
out, ”Okay we have a size one,” let's
say, drake … I don’t know if they’ve
actually created a cooler at the moment but,
Drake cooler well, where does that sit as
far as its capabilities.
Is it a C grade item?
What does a C grade item mean?
We define that and then we can place those
on ships that would be appropriate for that
part.
Size two or a medium sized cooler would go
on one of the larger ships.
It has it’s own determinants and positives
which you can decide how you want to output
your ship by the purchasing the component
or when we have future gameplay which you
can salvage components, perhaps you can actually
pry one off a large shipment and say, “Hey
this is way better than mine, I’m gonna
go and place it on the holotable and include
that on one of my loadouts for one of my ships.”
Also in the future we may allow the capability
of particular like craftsman to hone certain
components so that they can actually improve
them.
Maybe the get better at improving a certain
manufactures coolers and power plants.
DV: Tuning and overclocking and stuff.
KT: Yup and so that would be great, it would
be a great career for someone to be a specialist
in.
DV: you’re a ship mechanic.
KT: Yup and then you can earn your credits
or do whatever you want to do and become that
go to person in the Star Citizen Universe
to get better at that particular skill.
What else did they … Oh, so the tuning,
So what does tuning and balancing mean?
Well it means different things for each of
the components.
What is ultimately does mean is that we figure
out what each of the components do, what their
range of capabilities are for their particular
stats and then we make realistic ranges for
those particular values.
We’ve done a pass of coolers, we’re in
the middle of doing powerplants and we are
in the middle of refactoring shields as a
system entirely so we will have shield emitters
on the ship that are powered by shield generators.
So when you upgrade shield generators by purchasing
a new one, you will increase the shield capabilities
of your ship.
Things like, well a number of faces will most
likely be tied to the ships but, the regeneration
rate of the ships, the absorption of the shields
rather, how quickly it can shunt power from
the primary face that you set onto the ship,
these will all be things you can upgrade by
purchasing new shield generator components.
DV: Speaking like someone in the middle of
combat, you want to redirect further energy
to the front or to the aft or from the you
know forward starboard side.
KT: So if you have a lesser performing shield
generator for example, it may take longer
for a shield face with zero health to recover
and get back any shield capabilities.
So you may consider purchasing or finding
a better shield generator to upgrade that
particular capability.
That may mean more power draw so you actually
have to purchase a powerplant that is capable
of powering all the components that you decided
to fit onto the ship.
So that’s what balance entails.
We’re currently, most of our components
are outclassing their capabilities so powerplants
generator more power than you’ll ever need,
coolers can cool more heat than you could
ever generate.
What we need to do is as we implement this
components, we need to step back and take
a look at what the actual values for the components
that we’ve created, what are those ranges?
What are those extremes?
How do we figure out how these components
fit within those extreme ranges and then figure
out, “Okay, this is the sweet spot for that
particular component, and this is where it
sits.”
As the player, you decide by mixing and matching
the components onto your ships, how they actually
work and whether they provide the desired
functionality that you want to implement.
DV: While still maintaining usability and
functionality.
KT: Yup
DV: I’m trying to remember correctly, I
think Matt Sherman explained it to me.
For example the ship had two shield emitters,
it could be there’s one in the front, one
in the back or one left or right, I mean you
pretty much have two halves of a shell correct?
KT: Right and so.
DV: One has four and you’ve got much more
control because now you’ve gotten quadrants.
KT: So those are faces.
I want to create six because to me four doesn’t
quite make a lot of sense.
DV: Right.
KT: Front back makes sense.
DV: And you’ve top and bottom as well.
KT: Right so bubble makes sense, front back
makes sense, I think six is the next logical
step, but that is a function of smaller ships.
Now when we get to capital ships, ultimately
what we want to do is, you’ll want to have
say four shield emitters, one that controls
the front quarter, the second quarter, the
third quarter and the rear quarter.
Each of them controlling their own faces,
that way we’ll have gameplay in which you
destroy the shield emitter or the generators
that are connected to the front port faces,
you actually have a chance in now infiltrate
the ship from the front and give you an incentive
to go after the sweet spot in the front that
you’ve dedicated so much time to destroy
with a squadron of small fighters.
DV: Well now let's say you have a long carrier
like a Bengal or Pegasus or even an Idris
I mean you set up something that long, you
could even have mid bulk emitters so if one
of those gets taken out you still have an
opportunity to have something sneak in while
one of those shields are still on before it
pops back up.
KT: Right, exactly.
DV: We can create some really cool missions.
KT: And I think it’ll allow players to figure
out strategies not only to attack shields,
but defend themselves.
If you find that you frequently outclass in
the front, well let's get some shield generators
and upgrade them on the front side because
we know that’s our weakest point of entry.
DV: A very spartan type of attack.
Or you can lower one of them and try to lure
them into it knowing that’s where your main
guns are.
KT: Yeah, eventually we’ll get to actually
figuring out how the engineer can do things
like shunt power or priority to those shields
and so, this is a big discussion on one of
these systems and we’re doing this for each
of the components as we go down the line.
DV: It’s pretty exciting stuff.
This next question is kind of a much more
production related question from...
[20:04] Perry Hope asks: Do the producers
specialize on a game aspect or do you need
to know ‘everything’ about that game?
DV: That’s an interesting question, one
of the goals of what production is is we basically
try and make sure that designers like Kirk
have the resources they need to make the game
possible.
So, while the production coordinator for the
tech design and engineering team.
It’s not my job to know how to do coding,
or how to do engineering or necessarily know
how to do tech design, I just need to make
sure they have the resources they need, make
sure the information is being correctly funneled
to them.
Now, ultimately what can cause a bottleneck
is something like lack of communication or
what else would you consider…
KT: That is the priority number one, communication
is the most important thing that a producer
can provide any employee...
DV: Right.
KT: In development, we need to keep those
channels open and ensure that everyone knows
what they need to do and are expected to do.
That way we don’t have issues where, ‘hey,
I didn’t know that Jimmy over here was supposed
to be doing this.
I’ve been waiting for him to finish this
other task, which prevents me from implementing
thing I wanted to do…’
DV: Right.
KT: So, communication is absolutely number
one.
DV: A good producer will be able to keep their
team in the loop at all times, an excellent
producer will be able to preemptively predict
what obstacles are coming down the road.
Be able to foresee what things down the road
are going to bottleneck, such as knowing what
the other teams are working on.
For example, we have Mark Hong, who is our
art and animation producer, so if I am working
on a particular feature as a producer…
my goal is I want to be able to talk to Mark
and find out what he’s working on.
See how what he’s going to do is going to
effect what Kirk’s team is coming or is
doing down the road.
So if we see Kirk is working on a particular
component for a ship, if I find out from Mark
early on that that ship is going to be delayed
or the art isn’t coming along as quickly
as possible it’s my responsibility to provide
that information to Kirk say, “Hey, we have
a little more cushion time as far as that
particular ship so if you have something else
you need to work on, some low hanging fruit
that you want to complete in the meantime”.
That’s where the producer comes and lets
these guys know, that’s what’s available.
As far as specialization, it’s useful to
be able to talk to those developers at an
educated level, like I said before you don’t
need to know how to program but at least know
what those programmers are doing and what
they’re working towards.
Same thing with tech design, we necessarily
don’t need to know everything about game
balance but we need to know what their objective
is and how do producers help them to complete
that objective.
KT: From a developer’s standpoint, it is
my responsibility to inform producers as far
as the things they do need to know about that
particular task so they can make an educated
choices about scheduling and task party, etc.
At the same time, when I do need to talk to
say one of the artists or animators directly,
it should be part of my duties to inform the
producer in charge of that particular individual
that that is happening that way they can ensure
that maybe a higher priority task should take
precedence or they know to follow up on that
task in the near future and we can all figure
out... hey, were you along that timeline,
are we getting close to being done because
this person is waiting on that.
So, juggling tasks and figuring what priorities
of things is the resource we use from the
production team.
DV: So, it’s kind of a nitty gritty behind
the scenes look at game development, it’s
not the most romantic or glamorous type of
question but it is one that’s important.
That’s why we wanted to address it, there
are things that go on behind the scenes that
help streamline a lot of these things other
than just making pretty ships and cool levels.
[24:08] SloanWarrior asks: How did you decide
how to size the components for the components
system?
We’ve heard that ammo bins might be able
to hold fuel when they’re not being used
for ammo.
Is this a uniquely interchangeable system
or might other components also grant storage
space for one resource or another when removed?
KT: Great questions!
So…
DV: I’m thinking behind hidden panels,things
like that.
How about a fake fuel cap?
KT: Yep!
Smuggling is a topic that has come up for
piracy or just being able to stow equipment
safely for you, on your ship.
That is a topic we’re in the midst of discussion
for.
There was a pass on components for each of
the component types, they were mostly done
by, they were spearheaded by Elwin who took
the, metrics that we use for the ships and
for any of the buildings in FPS, the…
DV: We’re talking what metrics?
Volume, length?
KT: Right.
These are the standard minimum doorway size
that we have on the ship.
The standard minimum walkway path that we
need.
Things like seats, turret sizes, weapons,
any of these components we took a look at
them and decided “Ok”.
A size one small component should be roughly
this size, and no bigger than that size.
So we took the maximum allowable size for
the component and ensured that all those components
fit that size, fit neatly in that box.
So everythings boxed, box shape.
That way we can ensure that when we build
a ship that has a physicalised component when
we swap out a size one, say radar, then we
can actually implement another size one radar
in the same space without having to have custom
geo just for that enclosure, and that ensures
the swapability of components and allows us
to make components that are unique enough
to, make you want to get a different type
of component to suit a different need.
DV: So it’s actually something that we’ve
discussed in the past where we’re finally
starting to see it come to fruition as the
standardised modularity.
You might have heard some of us talking on
previous Ten for the Producers and Ten for
the Designers that we’ve been look at trying
to create standardisation for these sizes
for a long time.
And that was something that was spearheaded
by Elwin.
By creating standard bounty boxes you create
a template for every single size one, every
single size two because now we have a range
measurements that we can utilise to put those
on
KT: Right, and that’s important for us as
Designers because when we’re implementing
a ship in whitebox we can take these bounds
that we create for the ships and we know that
this is going to require a size 2 component
of this type.
We need to ensure that it is placed in the
ship roughly around here.
Well we’ll need access to it, because the
ship does have an interior so we can communicate
to the Artist that there needs to be a core
goal or some kind of wall in which there is
a panel that we can access this so when we
go to actually repair it or swap it out or
salvage it, if you’re a pirate!
There is the capability to physically access
that object.
What’s also interesting about that is when
we eventually have the ability to damage these
components from the outside, so we’ll have
gameplay and you’re shooting up a ship from
the outside you know you can target the shield
generator because you can take the shields
down.
Well you know where that is roughly in the
ship you can start shooting around it,and
you will know that it does embody a physical
location on the ship, and you know where to
target that particular component.
On a converse when it is destroyed you will
also know on the ship.
The engineering can tell you, “Hey get on
down to hallway A and repair the shield generator”.
That crew member will know exactly where to
go, which panel to pop open and which component
to repair.
DV: Or in your cargo hold you could have a
whole crate full of different shield generators.
Your engineer runs down, take one out, go
run back to the cargo, grabs the new one and
throws it in there.
So not actually fixing it but replacing it
as well
KT: Right.
So that’s just part one of the question,
part two was: what are the….
Are we going to allow rechangeability of components?
In general no.
So most components will be in a specific spot,
slot put together for that component.
Some of the component types though, such as
ammo, fuel, I think there was one more.
I can’t remember off the top of my head
but there is a category of components in which
you can choose to fit anyone of those types,
that fit in that particular range of components
in that slot.
So if we do have say a smuggling hold that
is placeable on our pirate themed ships.
That is a component type you can choose to
fit onto that ship.
If however if you really want to on the same
ship, fit it for longer quantum travel or
further distance.
Maybe you’ll choose a quantum fuel or a
regular fuel canister instead.
If you really want to fit out a ship with
a lot of weaponry, well let’s put an ammo
box in there instead.
So there is a category of component types
that we are implementing in the near future.
However for the most part components will
fit into their actual designed slot.
DV: I just thought of it’s like a ship USB
system
KT: Yeah.
Not quite that modular!
DV: But at the same time.
Let’s say you have one labelled as a fuel
tank and technicality it’s actually a cargo
hold.
If let’s say a player’s a police officer
that’s trying to investigate this pirate
ship and he see’s a fuel tank there, well
he knows pirates tend to use these as cargo
holds.
I remember hearing someone discussing about
being able to scam them and be able to trick
scammers as well?
KT: That is something that we’ll have to
design and implement but yeah, sure
DV: Something way down the road!
KT: Yeah.
We can also design say a cargo hold that does
disguise itself as a…
DV: Fuel tank or an ammo box
KT: Fuel tank.
And it actually has that, when we implement
that actual scanning gameplay, perhaps there’s
a way in that it actually mimics the actual,
the component that it’s trying to pretend
to be that way you can smuggle, or use it
as a smoke ring canister, because we’re
only going to make a finite number of ships
and so there’s no way that we can say that
“Hey we can randomly generate these smuggling
holds”.
So each ship if you take a minute to study
you’ll know that “Hey it’s a capability
of it having this smuggling hold”.
So let’s figure out gameplay in which you
can make use of that item and still get away
with that gameplay by giving us the capability
to whoever is trying to scan that particular
item.
DV: If you use a car analogue.
No matter how many Ford Mustangs you look
at, you’re going to know where the engine
is every single time.
KT: Right.
[31:29] Sultann asks: We just have a big step
in Star Citizen.
Do you feel more pressure now than before
that the next big step will be more impressive
than 2.0?
DV: Essentially asking with every release
do we feel pressure to out do ourselves every
time.
And that’s a ubiquitous, unanimous yes.
When we released 2.0 that was with much great
fanfare that we finally released multi-player,
multi-crew technology but we already had our
sights on 2.1 and now we’ve got our sights
on 2.2.
And every time we release one of these patches,
yes the pressure is there to deliver, but
we’re always confident that we can deliver
more and more.
That’s kind of the … that’s kind of
what we do every single time.
If we tried to release inferior content every
time … we want to make sure that we are
wowing you guys with every new release.
That’s why we are constantly showing you
guys new ships, new technology.
That's why we have discussions like this to
keep you guys up to date on what we are working
on.
So is there pressure?
Absolutely, but we are pretty confident that
we can out do it each time.
KT: And just like any other company the more
and more we do this, the better and better
we get.
DV: Yes.
KT: This includes things like planning for
the future.
May not have been so great at that in the
past but as we overcome more and more hurdles
and get to each goal, we get better and better
at planning for what we’ll need, ensuring
that we can achieve these things without simply
having it as a line item in an email “hey
we know what we’re going to do how do we
get there?”
Figuring out the steps that we need to take
and incrementally improving on each of these
processes is something we are getting better
and better at every day.
DV: This is actually where a lot of production
work comes in: being able to pre-plan what
those objectives are.
We may, let’s look at 2.3 or 2.4 and beyond,
we may have a rough idea of what we want to
be in those patches and ultimately Chris is
going to dictate we want in those patches,
what content we want to deliver, so it is
up to Production to be able to pre-plan all
these schedules out.
And this is where a lot of our tools like
Jira, Microsoft Project … what we are starting
to do is standardise a lot of … in fact
as Kirk mentioned, as we do this and fine
tune this standardisation of our practices
is going to help us accomplish those goals
and make them higher quality each time because
we are looking what tasks we have done in
the past; what we’ve completed before; and
how can we apply those same practices in the
future.
So I guess just as long as we keep on trucking
it’s going to get better.
Next question comes from Raven ...
[34:16] Raven asks: What are your thoughts
on massively increasing the hull and shields
on all ships equally across the board?
Currently I feel ship battles are over quickly
and this gives little time to respond to system
failures in larger ships.
I would like to see this as battles would
be longer and more immersive, allowing you
to repair systems and hull breaches for more
of the “decisions matter” effect.
Right now by the time you take on damage the
fight is over before you can finish the chair
animation.
DV: That’s kind of the nature of the smaller
ships though right?
KT: I mean yes and no.
This is a very fair criticism of some of the,
especially the Arena Commander, battles.
What we need to do when we are refactoring
each of these systems, shields is being refactored
as we speak, we then need to take a balance
pass and figure out what we need to do to
change the min and max ranges of each of the
values in the system.
So for example, with the shields we are going
to introduce gameplay in which you can do
things like give priority to a certain shield;
or change the way it can repair faces faster;
or do shield face hardening; or the way in
which faces can absorb damage or deflect damage
away.
So once we implement these systems and get
that gameplay into the game then we need to
go and sit with each of the ships and start
shooting at the ship, figuring out “okay,
well ships of this size with this particular
shield can withstand this much damage for
this amount of time” and put that all in
a big chart and then figure out where each
of the ship lies and if we need to tweak any
changes.
So to answer you question, we do need to better
balance passes for each of our systems.
Making hulls and shields across the board
larger may not be the best way to do that.
DV: We want to have more tactical combat rather
than just overall buffs.
KT: Sure, and so what we can do is, we can
take a look at each of the systems individually,
shields, hull, health, mass, damage per second,
by weapon type, etc. and figure out “okay,
where in the realm of the things that we want
to look at, like DPS for weapons, where does
that particular weapon sit?
Where should it sit?”
If it isn’t sitting in the right place we
figure out “okay, we need to tweak these
particular values and make sure that they
do fit a role for that particular component
type.
So yes we want to make gameplay more interesting.
We will do that with balance.
I think this will definitely come into play
as we start making larger and larger ships
because as we do implement ships, or ship
types, that we haven’t before we need to
figure out “okay, how do we do this without
breaking what already exists?”
So if we make, say, the Constellation, if
we made it impossible to destroy with a couple
of Hornets it wouldn’t be very fun.
So figuring out where, again, the ship lies;
where the capability of each of its systems
types should lie and ensuring that those values
are correct is part of our jobs and we need
to be better at that.
DV: At the same time let’s look at real
world analogies or comparisons: if you have
two people on motorcycles that crash into
each other at high speed chances are they’re
both going to get wrecked.
Pretty quickly.
If you have a car hit a motorcycle the chances
are the car will be a little dented but the
motorcycle will be pretty totalled.
KT: It’s true.
We still need to, as game designers, we still
need to figure out a way in which that is
fun.
DV: Yeah.
Absolutely.
So you don’t want it to be over quickly
but you still want to add an element of adrenalin
pumping with tactical strategies.
KT: Right.
So that also comes into play when we’re
designing ships.
We can’t make a ship that is just OP, in
which playing any other ship types is just
no fun.
DV: Right.
KT: So we figure out how is it better than
other ships, yet consider if you have a fleet
of smaller ships can they take it out?
Let’s figure out a way we can do that.
DV: Ultimately just establishing a really
good strong meta for the combat.
KT: Yeah.
DV: So this one comes from Minion Soldier
and this is kind of an interesting one …
[38:54] MinionSoldier asks: How do you coordinate
efforts between game play feature implementation
and relative ship completion?
For instance, if mining was being brought
into the client would you automatically put
the Orion into production?
Or would you shelve mining until the Orion
or the other small mining vessel was done?
DV: This is where a lot of the strategic planning
and communication between production design
comes into play.
This is also where good direction from management,
Chris or Ben, also comes into play.
So when we release a feature or a ship thematically,
for example, if we wanted to do a salvage
feature, ideally we want to have content for
players to take advantage of that.
So, a salvage specific ship would be a good
example of releasing when we released the
salvage mechanics, same thing if we wanted
to release a repair mechanic, you know having
the what’s is it...
Endeavor.
Having that come out at the same time would
make good sense.
If we created a mining mechanic using your
example here, if we created the mining feature
but we don’t give players a ship to do mining
on.
It’s a feature that’s basically sitting
there waiting until we have that feature completed
or a ship to take advantage of that feature.
Ultimately, this is where planning and preproduction
and communication comes into play.
KT: Right, so none of these things are coincidental.
When we do decide to create a ship and decide
a release date for it, we need to ensure that
the systems that make that are unique to that
ship actually exist… are designed out and
are implemented from code and tech design
so that those systems are in play by the time
the ship is actually created.
DV: A good example is quantum travel, if we
released quantum travel without any ship that
can quantum travel…
KT: Doesn’t make a lot of sense.
So, there is a lot of design that goes into
that… quantum travel is a great example.
We needed to decide what quantum travel was,
how it realized itself in the game, how the
component interaction for quantum travel was,
standard things like the distance for quantum
travel, time for quantum travel, quantum fuel
is a thing now so we implement quantum fuel
as a part of quantum travel.
That’s a system that needed to be designed
before we created a bunch of ships that were
capable of doing quantum travel.
DV: Excellent question but yes it is not coincidence
that we release these like that.
[41:17] Ezreail asks: With regards to the
increase in ship sizes, I.E Idris, are some
of the smaller capital ships still going to
be capable of landing planetside.
If they can when will we be able to actually
walk in and around them.
I’ve been jonesing to see what the Idris
has become since its transformation.
DV: I’ve been waiting for this question
this is a cool one.
KT: Great question.
We are discussing that now.
However for the most part, the, we are deciding
which ships are planetside landing capable
or not when we design the ships.
One interesting topic that came up was, for
some of the snub nose or smaller fighters,
we are deciding to either make them Quantum
Travel capable or atmospheric landing capable.
As a trade off between for having such a small
ship you need to pick one that suits the needs
that you are looking for.
This is especially important when we have
ships that are capable of carrying smaller
ships.
The Connie is an example of one, though the
Merlin doesn’t actually function on it yet,
but when it does, you’ll get the capabilities
of what the Merlin is able to do when that
comes online.
For other ships that have snub nosed fighters
for example or a carrier ship you can decide
Well you know what I really wanted to park
this carrier outside of a planet and then
go down to the planet surface using all these
smaller atmospheric landing capable ships.
Or what I really want are a bunch of say like
taxi style vehicles that allow you to shoot
across the galaxy and then meet up with other
ships very quickly.
You’ll need to make a decision.
So as we design each ship we are deciding
whether or not they are Quantum Travel capable
and atmospheric landing capable.
So these are things we’re deciding and it’s
on a ship by ship basis.
When will we get to see this?
Well that’s a great question!
We’re still, we’re working on these we’re
making these ships as fast as possible however
all of the ships that are medium size or larger
are definitely going to have interiors that
you can walk around in.
I discussed earlier things like being able
to access the components from the inside.
That’s going to be a big thing and so yes
there will be interiors that you can walk
around with, walk around in.
And then interact with other crew members,
components, systems.
There will be standards things we have like
beds, bathrooms, etc
DV: We want to give players a reason to walk
around these large ships.
A reason why you want to walk down this hallway
and open this door and other than just, besides
having the reason of just having a large ship.
We want to give you guys a reason to walk
down that hall, open the door, access this
panel.
Apart from just being for that reason
KT: And then we’ll need to make decisions
such as how do we make modular components
for these ships so, at least on a ship level
for well when we create a ship like an Idris,
it’s impossible to fill every square inch
of that thing with custom geos so we need
to figure out what a standard hallway is,
what a standard room is like, what the engineering
station is going to be like, what the, if
there’s an engine housing room, if there’s
a cargo area that we can make modular and
place on several parts of the ship if there
are landing areas for that ship how do we
figure.
We make choices so that we can make a ship
that’s functional and is within reason schedule
wise because we want to create the best as
quickly as possible these are things we consider
when we are designing and ultimately building
the ship from nothingness to something that
we can actually see in the game
DV: Let me give two examples.
For those who are anime fans look at the Cowboy
Bebop anime series.
you’ve got the Bebop ship that carries:
spike’s, swordfish.
And you’ve got also Faye and Jet’s smaller
ships.
They use the Bebop through Warp Gates carrying
those ships even though the Bebop can land
trans-atmospherically it still has smaller
ships that it can with it.
But if you look at something like Battlestar
Galactica where they have giant fleets of
ships and some of them are orbital space stations
that are jump capable but something that is
shaped like a ring or like an orbital station
is not going to be able to land so you want
to have shuttles and lighter ships, well they’re
called lighters, that can go inbetween ship
to ship or trans-atmospherically up and down.
We’ll even have orbital docking yards where
you get up from there and you take a taxi
or a shuttle back down to the surface.
It’s ultimately going to be decided by what
that gameplays need is, what the ships functionality
is going to be is, what the role that ship
is going to fill.
So ultimately there’s going to be an ultimate
large size of what ships can land something
like…
KT: I don’t think we’ve made that decision
yet.
I think we’re going to decide on those capabilities
based on the role of the ships.
“What is that ship made for?
What is the reason to own that ship?”.
Then we’ll make a decision about those particular
characteristics at that point
DV: Right.
I can figure something like a Bengal Carrier
trying to make a landing would cause major
atmospheric problems.
[47:03] AragornBH asks: What is the most useful
suggestion you have received from a Star Citizen
backer?
Did it change the way in which you value feedback?
DV: This is a very subjective question and
we filled you with a lot of technical details
today, especially as far as a lot of component
information.
We get a lot of input from all around because
this is a crowdfunded game we get a lot of
input from players on where they’d like
to see the game go; what ship we should create;
and ultimately while we are following Chris’
visions we still like to solicit feedback
from the backers and our from audience.
The most interesting one that I got was a
possible cultural faux pas I did back in one
of the original 10 for the Producers where
I made a joke, what I thought was a pretty
safe joke, it did end up offending a couple
of backers from a particular geographic region.
KT: Please do tell.
KT: [to camera] I didn’t know about this!
DV: Someone asked me how did I meet Travis
or what’s it like working with Travis.
And I said I’d met Travis in a, I think
I said, Serbian prison camp: he took a knife
for me once and I’ve been indebted to him
ever since.
KT: Ah.
DV: It was said, just, offhandedly there was
no intention … I could have said a Japanese
prison camp or an Antarctic prison camp.
It didn’t matter, the joke was regarding
the prison camp itself that he took a knife
for me once and I’ve been indebted to him
ever since.
That was the joke but because I used a certain
countries reference that does have a history
of particular turmoil a lot of viewers from
that region were really upset.
And I know it sounds very superficial but
it actually did change the way present information
and the way I think about certain answers
and the way I actually approach certain individual
within in the company as far as being more,
not necessarily being politically correct
or culturally aware, but it did remind me
that we have a very wide audience.
And while trying to walk the neutral line
is an impossible thing ultimately there is
a way information can be presented in a very
humorous way and while still being able to
maintain an objective conclusion.
KT: Staying professional is pretty important.
DV: Right.
Anything from you?
KT: I can’t think of anything specifically.
What I will suggest though is that we do get
a lot of feedback from the community and it’s
terrific.
Keep it coming.
We do read everything and we do consider everything.
Some things are simply impossible to implement
or it’s not feasible within either the design
or the scope of the systems or the …
DV: Or technical capability!
KT: … the world we’re creating.
However we do enjoy all the ideas.
Any idea that comes from the backers and the
community is welcome.
So let us know your feedback because without
you voicing your opinion we don’t know what
you guys are thinking.
So continue that and we welcome it all.
DV: Yeah.
We could be working on a great idea from our
perspective, looks absolutely amazing and
kick ass, but we put in game and realise a
lot of players aren’t using it because they
might find it boring or it may not fit the
original vision we had for it.
So this is where a lot of feedback from you
guys comes in.
So I want to amend my answer a little bit:
while that one instance I gave is something
that changed my perspective we do look at
everybody, as Kirk says, we do look at everybody’s
suggestions and it is those suggestions that
help mold the game.
KT: We got these questions from you guys!
DV: Yeah, absolutely.
[50:58] Outro
DV: So again it’s been a very, very technically
oriented 10 for the Developers with Kirk giving
us a lot of information as far as the Components
system and how a lot of that fits into the
game system.
So hopefully you guys enjoyed it.
We try to keep it as entertaining as possible
but again we wanted thank the Subscribers
for being able to make this kind of content
possible: without you guys none of this would
be able.
So from us it is a very humble thank you for
making this capable.
Once again I’m Production Coordinator Darian
Vorlick.
KT: And I’m Lead Technical Designer Kirk
Tome.
DV: So thank you again.
Thank you for watching this 10 for the Developers.
See you guys next time.
KT: Bye.
