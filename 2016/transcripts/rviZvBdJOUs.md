Mark Abent: Oh hello there, welcome to Bugsmashers.
Hey everyone, we’re here in fun little environment
with two clients in a multiplayer test and
we have a bug in that remote ships are not
moving, they’re calling it a desync issue
so if I fly this guy around, weee.
We stop him for a moment so I flew a bit,
you’ll see on this client that he’s actually
stayed still, nooooo.
So, what’s happening.
Oh shenanigans, that’s what’s happening…
but for real, so if we have a ship and he’s
flying around and then some fun guy in the
Persistent Universe goes, ‘I want that ship’
and they get into a dogfight and you know,
the first player explodes into a glorious
fireball.
He’ll respawn and from then on you’ll
never see the ship move, or other clients
won’t except if you wait long enough eventually
it’ll start moving along.
What’s happening is the worst thing ever,
so we have a ship, I’m going to use… what
shall I use today?
I will use this paper notebook.
So we have this ship and when we spawn him
in we give him the ID of let’s just say
2, now he flies around and explodes.
We need to spawn a new one because well this
guy still wants to dogfight.
So we spawn a new ship and we give it the
same ID because why not, I mean keep everything
the same so we give him the same ID, we give
him all his loadout information and he spawns.
Problem is when this guy spawns on the server,
the other clients may still have the old one
around...oh, phone fell… or the old one
is gone but they still are getting packets
of information from the original ship.
So, IFCS checks to see the last time it has
got a response from the server for any packets
coming in and if it gets, you know, say a
tick from the server of 600 but we just died
and we’ve resetted our tick it would get
a tick of 600 and it’ll think, ‘oh, we
should be at 600, we should be at 600’ but
then our new ship starts sending information
and the tick’s going to be at 0-1-2-3-4
and it’s going to be like, ‘wait a minute,
our last one was 600, our new one is smaller
so we’re going to ignore all that’ and
because it’s ignoring it, you basically
see the remote client just stay still.
Not cool.
So, for now what we have done are, let’s
just say Sir Paul has done, is he has added
a work around that checks to see if there’s
some conditions we can see to restart the,
you know, the flight controller again.
Here you can see if we’re in the bad server
state because of the aspect bug it will just
allow it and get processed.
It’s a good work around for 2.5 and let’s
start this up and as this recodes... but it
has disclosed a bad thing in our networking
code that we’ll have to take a look at soon
but it’s going to be such a big change it’s
too risky for 2.5.
You know, it’s pretty bad when you have
a new entity spawn in and it’s getting information
from the old system.
I mean what happens if you have health of
5 or 10 or you die, you spawn but then you
get information that you’re health should
be 0 from the server because it’s from the
old system and you die again, not cool.
So, there’s going to be some weird oddities
until this gets resolved but this work around
will at least allow you to fly until the networking
issue can get resolved which should happen
shortly.
So, let’s pop up...recodes still going.
Take my sip of coffee.
All right, recode is gone.
I’m going to move my clients, so as you
can see the ship already moved around.
Let’s see if we can find him… he snapped
to the correct state, where did you go...
oh, there he is, there he is.
All right, so there’s the other Argo and
if I go on here you now correctly see him
move about, weee.
Oh the shenanigans of game design or programming,
same thing, all right.
So, we had a fun little issue with, you know,
remote ships just dead stopping.
No longer updating when a ship dies and respawns,
it would just stay there and some time later
it will just start magically working.
It was tracked down by Paul, fun bug because
it just realized a bigger issue we have where
if we use the same entity ID on a ship that
we’re… we delete it and spawn a new one
with the same entity ID or ID, any old packets
that come in the other clients will start
using them so with the flight controller it
checks to see if the server tick is a certain
number and if it gets lower numbers it flat
out ignores it.
Paul put in a work around to make sure the
ships continue to fly even if it gets some
bad information but we’re going to have
to look into the deeper issue because we can’t
have the network, you know, sending old information
to new entities from old entities but you
know that’s how it is in working on a game.
You think you’ve covered something and then
you get a bug that uncovers some crazy other
shenanigans.
Well, we’ll have to fix it but until next
time I hope you guys enjoyed, bye.
