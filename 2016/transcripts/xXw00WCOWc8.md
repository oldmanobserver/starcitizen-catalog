Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome back
to Bugsmashers, but before we begin I’ve
got a small riddle for you.
If I fix a bug, but there was no Jira for
the bug, did the bug even exist?
Closed Captioning provided by the Imperial
News Network.
Hey everyone, we’re here in another fancy
dancy test level and we have a fun bug where
if we’re in the buggy on normal plane, everything
is fine, but as soon as we have gravity that’s
not aligned to the standard world Z, you know
Z down, we get some fun issues with the view.
So let's take a look at that.
Weee.
So if I pop in third person, oh no!
All the shenanigans.
This buggy code was written with the assumption
that the world Z was always pointing down,
but if you have you know let's see, we have
something like I have here where I have a
gravity box pointing 45 degrees to the side
and not world Z down, the code just goes bonkers
because it makes assumptions that it shouldn’t
be making.
So let's pop out, turn our free cam off.
Alright.
So hop into our legacy buggy code.
This particular view or this vehicle seat
view is for the buggy, or basically any what
do you call it, driving vehicles and what
it does is as you're driving…
I can show you.
Weee, hop in.
So as you’re driving, it kind of wants to
keep the view towards, well no I flew off.
I have to increase gravity, this shenanigans.
Game design, always something.
There we go, increased our bounding box.
Hop in, there we go.
Alright back to the buggy.
What this views tries to do is as you’re
moving, it tries to center the view behind
you or towards where roughly the velocity
is so, if you’re moving this way, it tries
to rotate you behind and if I back up, it
will try to you know, go behind my buggy.
It’s mostly so that you can see roughly
where you’re driving towards.
If it always behind you or in one particular
view, you could hit a wall and not know why
so it’s a pretty nice fun thing, and of
course you can move around, but then if you
let go of the mouse it will try to orientate
itself, and because it’s assuming that fun
Z down issue, we get all sorts of alignment
stuff when we have gravity that’s not on
the same alignment as the world.
Especially for planets where you’re going
to have a sphere and the gravity’s always
going to be relative to the planet so we can’t
always assume the world Z is down.
So we had Chad Zamzow create a nifty little
fix where if I uncomment this, he basically
has this thing called a gravity rotation,
and its matrix he’s using to figure out
if all the code here before assume that Z
down, so if we’re going to assume that all
the codes going to stay like that, but we’re
going to have a rotation, this grav rot basically
says: “Alright, we assume this is all Z
down, but we’re going to move it this way”.
This is what this little grav rotation gives
us.
So it’s like “Alright, we can keep the
code that everything's down, but we’re going
to assume that we can modify our gravity”,
So this guy says what our opposite says.
So what we can do if we traced all the areas
that use this new thing, we can get our velocity
and then check to see what our rotations going
to be and use that to determine you know,
we’re flying along the axis and do all sorts
of fun little updates.
So he transforms the velocity, the angular
momentum, and if we pop down…
Where is it.
In here, the second thing he finally does
is, it’s at the very end but we shoot a
ray trace.
Given that we have transformed, use my fun
little car.
So if the Z’s pointing this way, and then
we rotate it this way, we apply the offset
to the whole view and we even apply it to
when we shoot trace lines so that if you’re
against the wall, it will bump into the correct
location and rotate according to that gravity
bounds.
So if we pop back in with his fun fix.
Recode!
What’s cool is since he’s using the gravity
straight from physics, this will work if you’re
in a buggy that's driving inside of a constellation
or a bigger ship.
If you’re on a planet, if you have gravity
box it will work depending upon what our fun
gravity is.
Back to our non world Z gravity.
Hop back in, weeee.
Turn on our car, go to the third person and
wala!
As we move around, he applies the offset so
everything works just as expected and the
code assumes everything was Z down, but because
he’s now applying that offset, everything
gets lined up correctly.
The position, the rotation and even the speed.
So as you’re zooming by, the camera will
pan towards your velocity and if you back
up, it will go the opposite way.
Of course it’s limited by parameters by
the designers, but it works as expected.
The beauty of this is if you’re on a planet
and if you’re going around and around, it
aligns up perfect with the gravity.
So as you go around, the camera is stuck to
the vehicle as it should.
Well, hope you guys enjoyed, I’ll fly off
into outer space, weeee.
So the buggy had some buggy code where it
assumed that the gravity was always pointing
Z down so if you rotated, the gravity still
faces this way instead of down, the camera
just goes ballistic because it's still assuming
it’s down and good old Chad had a little
nifty fix where he figured out what the actual
gravity was, so even though it assumed this
way for the code, we could find the offset
and then apply the offset to the velocity,
the angular velocity, basically everything
that was needed that the camera assumes and
rotates around and he just applied the offset
to it, worked like a charm, the buggy is no
longer buggy, and that’s never going to
get old, and now everything works as expected.
You can drive around the planet or even weird
crazy gravity vectors and the camera stays
behind like it should.
Hope you guys enjoyed, until the next buggy
bug.
