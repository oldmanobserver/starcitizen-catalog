Randy Vasquez (RV): Hey guys, my names Randy
Vasquez, Associate Producer for Cloud Imperium
Games.
We’re here for 10 for the Developers and
for the first time we have...
Vincent Sinatra (VS): Vincent Sinatra, QA
Lead.
RV: Nice.
So we have questions, but we also want to
thank subscribers for making this possible.
It’s really awesome that we get to kind
of directly interact with you guys as well
as take questions and then kind of give you
our opinions or suggestions or kind of our
ideas and thoughts on what you guys are asking
so, ready to get started?
VS: Oh yeah, let's do it.
RV: Sweet
[0:51] Solitude asks: For both - What aspects
of the gamer process (by which I mean setting
resolution, visual quality, audio levels,
control schema, etc) do you find frustrating
// would you change given scope and resource
to do so?
VS: For me that answer’s easy it’s the
holo table
RV: What?
Everybody loves the holotable
VS: Really?
Who are these people?
VS: I don’t know
VS: I personally don’t really like the way
it’s functioning currently.
I don’t like to look at it, don’t like
to test it.
In fact I got some new testers now we’re
training up and i’m making them test it
because they’re the nuggets and that’s
their job.
RV: I guess personally the party system right
now.
The party system bothers me but at the same
time is I know that these are being worked
on and a lot of the feedback from the fans.
We’ve taken tonnes of feedback on things
and, so we’re definitely working on it.
So we’re pushing that soon.
I cannot say when so do not ask when but if
you’re even thinking about asking don’t
even do it!
VS: Yeah pretty much!
[1:46] Amontillado asks: What sort of techniques
or procedures do you recommend for those of
us that want to hunt and report bugs to CIG?
How can we most efficiently go about collecting
the information that you need?
RV: So this is kind of a question for you
…
VS: Yeah, I believe this is probably a QA
question and Issue Council type question.
So basically what we primarily want is people
to be concise, clear, clear steps running
through things you started doing but also
include … sometimes you’re only reporting
the thing that you saw and what you were doing
when you saw it, but sometimes what you were
doing before that impact things.
Like we had certain situations where people
were getting disconnected while joining Crusader
they would just tell us “Hey, I got disconnected
when joining Crusader”.
But, you know what, it was because they were
joining Arena Commander before they transitioned
to Crusader and their tokens weren’t getting
cleared and that was the issue.
So as much information as possible they can
provide is usually the best for us because
then we can pick through all that information
and get really good steps for the developer
so they can actually get a fix in.
RV: So I know with like release notes and
stuff we have ... do you guys set the release
notes?
VS: Yeah.
RV: So maybe in there we can be like “Hey
guys, can you focus on this?”.
Do we do that right now?
VS: We don’t do that right now.
That’s not actually a bad idea.
You know if somebody was a Producer …
RV: What?
VS: … they might be able to push something
like that forward!
That might be a good idea going forward.
RV: Man, see this is what happens when I open
my mouth!
VS: Yeah.
Exactly!
[3:17] Neuroquila asks: Since, thanks to the
Issue council, players are somewhat involved
in the QA process, do you search the council
frequently in search of hints to better explain
what went wrong for a particular problem or
do you just wait for issues to receive the
appropriate number of votes and then react?
VS: Well, me personally I’m in LA and we’ve
got a really small team, mostly we’re embedded
testers, we do a lot helping the developers
and stuff like that, I know our Austin and
UK we’ve got great QA teams out there who
are always in the Issue Council making sure
they're checking issues.
Now a lot of those issues are already written
up in our database cause we ran into them
during our normal sanity checks and smoke
tests and sweeps and stuff like that, but
the ones that do get rise to the top, those
are the ones we investigate, we make sure
we get in the database, we make sure we get
fixes out there because we know the backers
want that stuff fixed as soon as possible.
RV: So some people might not even know what
the Issue Council is.
What, like…
VS: Issue Council is where the backers and
all our Subscribers should be going to report
any sort of issues, and then if you run into
it you vote it up and the higher it goes in
the chain the sooner we take a look at it
and get it taken care of.
RV: Nice.
That’s kind of cool.
I’ve never used it since I just kind of
go over to your desk and I’m like …
VS: Yeah, you say is this happening and then
you hit me and yeah, that’s exactly what
happens pretty much for everybody
RV: Basically.
Poor guy has to put up with this.
[4:29] Drugh asks: How can we support testing
better.
Should we just try more crazy stuff, actually
intentionally cause havoc to break things?
Does the wealth of PTU data provide any new
insight into the process?
How does one prepare to QA the sheer number
of future features while simultaneously changing
the engine, adding new part, increasing the
complexity.
I feel this must be a moving target for QA
in an unstable environment?
RV: Yes.
VS: Yes.
RV: Yes.
RV: Yes.
It is definitely an unstable environment.
In fact more days than not it is quite unstable.
There’s going to be certain areas in the
code you can’t even look at.
There’s new iterations coming down.
As far as causing havoc, well when you’re
out there in the PTU I think we want more
controlled havoc…
RV: Actually yeah.
We would say controlled havoc or kind of like
planned chaos
VS: Planned chaos
RV: That was the one we were kind of like..
VS: Planned chaos that’s what we want.
Because doing strange and weird things is
always great.
Sometimes you find the best bugs by doing
something that the average user would never
even conceive of.
Like what happens if I land this ship of this
ship on top of another ship and you end up
with some sort of shipception or something
like that.
Sometimes you can do that sort of wacky stuff
and you could find some really good issues.
But you don’t want to do that to people
who don’t know what you’re up to.
Then it’s just griefing.
RV: Basically the point; don’t be a griefer
don’t be dicks.
Just be nice to people and if you want to
test something crazy seriously just…
We were talking about this, just be like...
VS: Just ask people
RV: Be like “Hey guys I want to do something
crazy.
Is anyone down for crazy?”.
VS: Yeah!
RV: Usually people will be like “Oh crazy?
We’re in, we’re doing this!”
VS: Yeah.
We got a pretty good crazy base going on!
People are just like to say “Hey I want
to try something wacky today does anybody
else want to come here and help me out with
this?”
And usually we get one or two people to jump
in.
I know i’ve done it a live server a couple
of times.
So that’s one of those things that you can
do as far as havoc.
As far as the PTU and how it helps us with
the process.
It really helps when it comes to performance,
stability.
We get those metrics from hundreds, thousands
of users and obviously that’s something
we can’t do internally because our Test
Teams are only so big
RV: And also on that.
People need to just log in and just be there.
Cause even just logging in for a little bit
here and there so that we can put the servers
through their paces, the Engineers are getting
really good information.
The Designers are getting good information
because the Designer can design something
and then all of a sudden it works when you
have one or two people there and you see this
all the time probably.
Five people there, but as soon as you hit
the ninth or the tenth person everything just
breaks down like crazy
VS: Whereever you can get those numbers it
really helps.
Because again the QA Teams are kept small
and focused so we can you know ‘laser fine
accuracy’ on what we need to be checking
but you know…
RV: SO point take away is: If you want to
do some crazy stuff seriously just put it
in chat and be like “Hey you guys i’m
trying this out does anyone want to join me?”
VS: Ask permission before you start using
the Glaive to lift up other ships and stuff
like that
RV: Just don’t kill someone cause we’ve
seen things on Youtube where people are just
going crazy and just ramming another ship
and the person’s not even taken off.
And i’m like “Come on people.
You know that’s griefing”.
VS: Because you don’t know how long that
person has to play.
You may be in there for a four house session
trying to hit up as much stuff as you possibly
can.
They’re only there for fifteen minutes.
They got kids, they’ve got to change diapers,
they got to get the food ready, they got a
bunch of other stuff.
They just want to jump in and see what we
have on the next PTU patch and they don’t
necessarily want to help you do crazy stuff.
So just clear it ahead of time if you’re
going to involve other people in your wacky
havoc causing tests.
RV: The other thing is.
We have such a strong community we don’t
need stuff like that it would just bring it
down.
Just help each other out.
Controlled and planned chaos is where it’s
at.
[8:17] Logical Chimp asks: When looking at
the QA team work load, roughly what is the
split in testing between: Running through
pre-defined scripts/regression testing.
Adhoc/experimental testing.
Targeted/specific feature testing (I.E gathering
stats on ship performance).
As a follow-on, what determines/changes this
allocation (I.E what determines if you need
to increase time on regression or spend more
time on ad-hoc testing, etc)?
VS: Well, as we’ve mentioned, it's largely
a moving target.
You know, usually we have our set predetermined
tests that we’re going to do on every single
build be it a smoke or a sandy check or something
like that, and whenever a new feature is developed
of course we’re going to go through a gambit
of tests that are designed around that feature,
but we’re also going to ad-hoc areas around
that feature, you know as it comes out.
I would say it’s probably about 40% regression,
40% targetted, 30% ad-hoc, because you know
QA, we give 110% every time.
RV: 110%
VS: Yes, that’s right.
RV: So actually we were talking about this
earlier, cause like whenever bugs come in
and, so we have a little thread in production
that’s like hey these are being flared out,
and it’s mostly just production and QA that
are on these threads, and it’s like hey,
this is the latest blocker, this is the latest
thing, whether it’s found through the community
or whether it’s found just through us internally
testing and all that stuff, these are getting
major priority, so as soon as these are sent
out the developers get it, and once the developers
fix it, a producer’s basically hitting up
one of the leads like you saying hey, we just
fixed this, here’s the change list…
VS: Lets get some eyes on it, let's get some
bodies on it…
RV: Exactly, and then people will just change
focus like that and just be like alright,
we need this, we need this now, we need this
now, so yeah, it's like building in quicksand…
VS: Pretty much, the situation is always fluid,
from one day to the next, from one hour to
the next, cause all of a sudden someone will
come along with something new, and that all
of a sudden takes priority and everything
else that you had gets shifted down a rung
on the ladder and you have to get to it later.
RV: Yeah, it’s always a lot of fun.
VS: Fun is not quite the…
no actually it is fun.
RV: It’s a lot of fun.
VS: It’s a lot of fun.
RV: Alright, so next question is from Steve
Hunter...
[10:24] Steve Hunter asks: When doing QA testing,
past resolved bugs are often retested to make
sure that new fixes don’t cause them to
reoccur.
As this would make the test list grow uncontrollably
large quickly, how do you decide when to no
longer retest an old bug?
And thanks for all the good work.
RV: Thanks Steve!
VS: This is actually a really good question.
So when it comes to that, usually we focus
on areas that have been affected by recent
code changes, like recently Mark McCall came
to me said hey, we’ve done a bunch of changes
to landing gear, so that immediately tasks
us out to start focusing, checking all those
old landing gear issues to make sure that
those don’t recur, because you know of the
changes that he just implemented, to make
sure that previous fixes didn’t get stomped
on by new changelists and so on.
So i mean, that’s pretty much, we try to
stay focused on the things that’re in motion
and are still changing, and then if something
hasn’t changed build after build after build,
we’re not necessarily going to be looking
at all those old issues again.
If they do return we’ll reopen them, but
we don’t necessarily focus on them.
RV: Yeah and that’s the thing, it’s like
I know, once the bugs have been through their
paces, they’ve been resolved and fixed,
once it hits a new area if we see it again
we’ll check the database and be like, okay,
this is back, and in all honesty there’ve
been some bugs, especially with landing gear
in particular that the landing gear comes
back so many times
VS: That’s why I brought it up, cause poor
Mark has been banging his head against the
wall, I swear to god some of these bugs spend
time in the Lazarus Pit and rise up stronger
than they were before, it’s just unbelievable
with some of them.
RV: It is pretty crazy.
[11:58] Far-Seeker asks: I know you have posted
some about this in your feedback threads already,
but could you give us an overview of this
activity, especially anything that submitters
can do to make the feedback more useful, as
well as more details on how this feedback
will be communicated to and used by the rest
of the QA and the ship designers?
VS: Yeah, so basically what I’m trying to
do is, because it seems like we are getting
so much feedback, I mean I had pages and pages
and pages of feedback ...
RV: Which sounds pretty awesome by the way.
VS: It was very awesome.
I mean the community is very passionate and
they gave us just tonnes of information but
some of it was information overload for developers
and designers who are already working hard
on new things.
And they’re like “When am I going to get
time to parse through all this data?”
So moving forward we’re going to try to
slow down the rate of those so that we give
them more time with each ship for the most
part.
RV: It’s still in the works like when we’re
actually going to be doing these I think,
right?
We still need numbers …
VS: Yeah, we’re still breaking it down.
Like I said, I was rapid fire, machinegun
style getting that stuff out.
And now obviously that was a little too much,
so we’re going to try and slow it down a
little bit.
RV: Ambitions, rambunctious I might add.
VS: Yes, yes.
A little bit.
A little bit overeager.
I’m kind of new here, trying to make my
mark and I’ve got to impress guys like Randy
every other day.
RV: It’s true.
It’s true.
VS: I was trying to work on that.
But as far as what details, just keep things
concise; keep things clear.
Try to keep things within scope: we’re not
always looking for “Hey, please buff my
favourite ship” type of stuff.
You want to make sure you know exactly the
type of thing we’re looking for.
Perhaps on my part I need to be a little more
clear as to what we’re asking for.
Now we’ve even had some growing pains through
some of the threads wit that …
RV: Yeah.
That’s the thing with some of the other
stuff we were talking about earlier is I would
love for people to break down the feedback
from different sections.
VS: Definitely.
RV: So even multiple post so that way like
“Hey, this is the arts posts on this”.
So that way you give everything for art, break
it down to design, mechanics ...
VS: Exactly.
Mechanics, balance …
RV: … to break it down as much as possible.
Yeah, balance-wise like “Alright so I’m
flying a 300, I’m flying a 315, they’re
almost the same ship but not really”.
But then just breaking it down that thing
like as much as … don’t be as verbose.
Clear, concise: definitely.
But don’t be afraid to give more examples
or give, at least … because the examples
you guys give, as well as just the detail
you guys can give us, anything is useful.
VS: Yeah and I was pretty much amazed at the
detail because we had graphics …
RV: Yeah!
VS: Particularly for the 300, people were
like “Hey this is how the redesign could
totally work” and I’m like “Is this
a resume?
Is this a job application?
Or is this just normal feedback?”.
So the detail was crazy good in some regards
and then in others people are all like “Hey,
give me a buff”.
For the most part.
I want, I want ...
RV: Make this ship the most powerful.
VS: … I want five gimbals on my ship!
Or something like that.
Those we don’t ...
RV: I love those gimbals.
VS: Hey who doesn’t?
But for the most part as long as it is clear,
as long as it is concise.
Keep things polite in the threads.
If somebody says something you don’t agree
with, hey we’re all trying to make the best
game together.
That’s the great thing about our community
is we’re working together.
RV: And honestly, the pointing out that thing,
if you guys have things different, varying
opinions that is perfectly fine.
We actually welcome that because then we see
different perspectives on how people are looking
at the designs, how people are looking at
the ships, the role of the ship, everything.
Any feedback is good feedback.
VS: Yeah.
RV: We can’t always act on everything and
we’re not going to be acting on it instantly
so give us time because we’re still working
on things.
We only have so many people to actually do
everything.
VS: Yeah.
And I’m going to try and make it easier
for the devs and designers to digest when
it does come in.
Try to get a top 5 bullet points and “Here’s
the rest of the report when you guy get around
to it but these are major things that are
either really bothering the community or they’re
really excited about getting implemented for
their particular favourite ships”.
RV: It would be super useful.
VS: Yeah.
Very useful.
All of it.
[15:53] AragornBH asks: Since you have played
many hours of Star Citizen and know the games
mechanics so well, what plans do you have
for yourself in the PU as a gamer?
RV: So this is kind of a loaded question and
the reason why it’s loaded is because I
really want to have kind of two personas when
I go out there.
I want to do one where I’m a mercenary/pirate
and stuff like that and seriously just get
in that whole clandestine thing and like be
on that black market.
I think that would be hilariously fun cause
I never play that kind of character.
Usually when I play an online game I’m either
support or a healer.
Of course the other one I would play would
be a miner.
Like when I played Eve, I was all about being
a miner and a trader.
So I think that would be really cool.
Just doing some mining, doing some cargo stuff,
that’s why I like when I was given the ship
the Caterpillar...
I was like all about it cause it had that
different mix of things that I was like, “I
can do this”...
VS: There you go.
RV: I can do this.
I’m actually looking really forward to just..
VS: That sounds pretty good.
RV: It’s going to change.
VS: Like you said everything is like a moving
target but yeah that’s pretty good.
I know once the game is out and I have one
mission in mind and that is to find Randy
Vasquez and kill him.
Pretty much.
I mean, I like cutting you guys down, that’s
the most fun of the day…
RV: I hate you in play test.
VS: Completely destroying you guys in play
test is so much fun.
RV: I can’t stand you so much in play test.
VS: So once we’re actually out there I figure
I could be some sort of CIG bounty hunter
and I’m just going around letting other
people know where CIG people are hanging out…
RV: Hunting CIG people.
VS: Maybe I can do some screen hacking.
Then you know, “Hey guys, they’re over
here” and we swoop in and destroy you all.
RV: I think we did a play test what is it,
a month or two ago, and basically I think
it was McCall or might have been you I think
was like, “By the way guys, Vasquez is at
Port Kariya’.
VS: Oh yeah.
RV: Next thing I know I had like four or five
ships coming in and I was like, “Oh God”
and then I’m trying to hide from everybody.
I shot at a few people but I think I shot
Jeremiah.
VS: That’s what I’ll be, I’ll be an
information broker who then leaks out where
CIG’s people are and then people can go
hunt them and have fun doing that.
RV: Nice, nice.
VS: Make a little you know…
RV/VS: Money on the side.
VS: A little bit.
A QA salary isn’t exactly that great.
[18:14] Space Is Nice asks: What is the priority
of developing things?
Is it ships -> places -> economy.
What takes priority over other things, like
shipping over ship buying or more to do in
one place over more places to go?
Thanks!
RV: Alright so.
As we’ve stated a few times, development
is always a moving target and priorities shift
daily, if not sometimes hourly based on what’s
broken or what the fire is and stuff because
we want to give you guys a stable game
VS: Yeah
RV: We need to give you guys, also QA a stable
game because...
VS: Stable builds.
RV: You guys can’t test if it’s not stable
VS: Exactly
RV: You guys testing in unstable environments
doesn’t help us because we don’t know
if the bugs you’re giving us are actually
there.
VS: And we can’t help you because someone
will be like “Hey will you check this, ” And
it’s like “ Well we can’t check it because…”
RV: So kind of to go off the questions like.
Versus ships, versus levels, versus economy,
PU, mechanics, systems; we have so many people
around the globe working on this game.
Everyone has their own focus, everyone has
their own priorities.
So we have an overall global organization
and then we have within that organization
we have the different studios and then within
that we have the each individual teams were
on something where they’re Designers, they’re
Artists, QA, Production, Engineers, Audio,
Narrative.
We have so many different aspects of this
that everyone is just all over the place all
the time.
There’s no ever a priority one thing over
another.
Like for instance if Crusader is broken, then
that’s kind of a level design but also design,
but it’s engineering, not so much Art so
that then becomes a focus for the select people.
VS: Where as the Artists will still be working
on the stuff that they’re already working
on.
RV: Yeah, yup so they don’t change focus.
Now if a ship is completely broken and a ship
needs to be redone due to this area, whether
they need to be redone for LOD’s ship setup
issues.
VS: Or a ship setup issue, LOD’s.
RV: Then it’s like the tech designers or
artist, they’re shifting over to help with
this and sometimes they need engineer support.
It is a case by case basis on really what
the priority is and that is actually coming
down from the community because every time
the community, like they’re yelling for
something, they need something, they want
something, we’re taking that into account.
Also the leadership team of CIG is also like
“Hey, so.”
They’re kind of always playing the balance
game of, “Alright this is what the community
wants and this is what they need, this is
the leadership team wants and needs,” and
kind of just doing that balance game of, “This
is our priority for right now,” and it’s
our priority until something else changes
and we still have like schedules that we’re
working on, but then
VS: We still have planned feature rollouts
and stuff like that as well
RV: Yeah basically.
VS: It’s just like you said things kind
of change up midstream every now and then.
RV: Yup, it is what it is.
[21:09] Daz asks: Hi Randy, can you share
some of both your own goals and the company
goals in production this year.
Is there a particular area you love working
on and are keen on improving?
And what games features are we likely to see
in the short, medium term this year?
RV: So this one for me myself I just want
to survive as a Producer.
It is so different from a Designer.
I’m enjoying it, it’s completely different.
I’m really loving, I like the communication
aspect of it.
VS: Yeah.
Yeah you’re really good at communicating.
Really good at communicating.
I got an inbox full of your communication.
RV: So I love that and I love facilitation.
So basically making sure the team is taken
care of.
going to everybody making sure they got everything
they need “Hey what’s up what do you guys
need?”
VS: Backrubs.
Regular backrubs, come to Randy
RV: Nice to know my numbers you may have saw
on the bathroom wall thanks
VS: That could be a good and a bad thing
RV: So i’m really enjoying that but what
I want to improve on though.
I really want to get the ships pushed out.
In a better timetable, I know we’re, we
push ships out and we’re letting you guys
know when ships are hitting.
And each ship is its own little special snowflake.
So it’s been hard to nail that down because
each ship has its own mechanics, each ship
has its own features
VS: Then there’s those features that’s
tied to each of the ships.
That need to be pushed out stuff like that.
Like you said the shields and armour balance
that Callix and everybody has been working
really hard on
RV: Callix just finished that audit for the
shields
VS: Just finished that whole audit for the
shields
RV: And you had to do all the testing too
VS: Yea I had to all the tests.
Trying to get all those out would be really
good and help give us more a final picture
of what the game’s going to be like, eventually.
With each ship that comes down it’s alright
but that’s just a small piece of the greater
puzzle
RV: And that’s the thing.
The audit you just worked on is part of something
bigger too because we’re doing, we’re
redoing doing some of the shields and how
they work.
Just cause it’s going to help optimise the
game overall.
VS: And how lasers affect the shields, how
ballistics affect the shields
RV: All that stuff is just being taken into
consideration.
So the design’s changing a little bit.
And it’s changing for the better and it’s
changing to make sure that players are given
the proper feedback they need.
As well as it has all the functionality necessary
things it has to have.
Shields are just crazy integral to the whole
thing I think as a game.
Especially for dog fighting.
VS: Especially for dog fighting.
Well I mean it’s hard to balance the ships
against each other when that system isn’t
fully fleshed out just yet.
RV: Where you around still when they had the
Constellation and the Hornet bug?
VS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I was one of the ones, the Hornet and the
Constellation were using the exact same shields.
RV: That was crazy
VS: That was a fun one
RV: There’s so many things with shields.
So yeah that’s a good example of something
we’re working on that’s going to be coming
soon
VS: Yep
Outro:
VS: I think that was all 10, wasn’t it?
RV: Yeah, that’s 10 for us.
VS: So that’s 10 for the Developers for
us today.
Once again want to thank all the subscribers
and all the backers, everybody who makes this
possible for us to do this.
RV: Thank you so much.
VS: I know maybe we weren’t quite as entertaining
as Tracy and Bender.
RV: We cannot follow…
VS: We were trying and would like to come
back and if you guys are into it.
RV: If they’re into it.
VS: If they’re into it, of course, everything
has to be consensual but you know… if we
could come back it might be nice.
RV: Yeah, it would be awesome.
I always love talking to 
the community.
VS: I always like this opportunity, this is
