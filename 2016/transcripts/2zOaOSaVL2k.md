Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone and welcome
to Bugsmashers!
Hope you guys enjoyed Citizencon, I know I
did, it was fun meeting and greeting you guys
- I can’t wait to do it again.
Today we got a special bug for you today - it’s
a little bug we had to deal with before showing
you guys that demo.
So let’s take a look.

Hey everyone, we’re here in this fancy level
- look how wonderful it is, it’s beautiful.
But we have here a Rover and in case you guys
didn’t see the demo, you basically would
fly in the Constellation, land down, go in
the rover then head out into the oblivion.
And sometime later you would actually get
ambushed and your front wheel would just pop
off from an explosion - boom!
- then you get out and shoot all the baddies.
So, it actually didn’t look like that the
very first time the designers set it up - in
fact it looked quite strange and I have here
the test conditions of what it looked like
- so let’s see what happens when the explosion
happens and then the front wheel is support
to fall off.
I’m going to hit the magical button.
Boom!
Not quite what the designers had in mind,
I don’t think they expected the tire to
float off into oblivion - kinda magical but
not what we wanted.
Ah, lovely, lovely, lovely.
Let’s jump into code and see what’s happening.
So over here we’re into the magical bits
of code - we’re in this thing called “VehiclePartBase”
- it’s basically the common code that all
of our parts have - if you have a wheel, if
you have a wing, if you have a cockpit - all
the part code that is common with those things
are in here and this specific section of code
handles when a part gets detached - you can
have multiple parts get detached and we stick
‘em onto a debris piece and they’re supposed
to bounce around, tumble, all which way, and
this particular bit of code will handle offsets
- so if we have two different debris pieces
they kinda get a little to the left, a little
bit to the right and they are centered here
so they tumble correctly.
Or if you have one that sticks out the origin
like the tire so it’s supposed to wobble
as it should.
Once we get passed that part, we basically
physicalize those pieces onto a specific slot
on that entity and when it gets this part
it actually goes through the entities, goes
through the physical proxy - which is like
our game code handler for the physics, it’s
one step before our physics engine - and inside
of here - boo - this “UpdateSlotGeometry”
- you are supposed to send it a mass, otherwise
it tries to compute it based on properties
set inside like max, these things are actually
supposed to be automatically computed - they
actually are in other sections of code but
this particular area where you are actually
modifying or updating - if you don’t already
have mass defined it tries to get it from
the properties of the max - which is a problem
because we want the things to be dynamically
determined.
Now we already have that mass to determine
what that wheel is supposed to be - so rather
it determining what it should be when we already
know what it is, we’ll just pass that mass
in.
We’ll have to change the interface a little
bit so that we can add a mass - we’ll make
the default negative one so it acts like it
should in other situations, or what it was
in other situations - so once we add the mass
through the interface, we want to send it
to the physics proxy and hopefully with that
said and done - we should see our wheel kind
of tumble.
I know, I know, it’s floating off into the
oblivion was nice but designers don’t like
that very much.
Right, we hit ‘recode’, there’s a wait
and see what happens.
Alright so we hit ‘recode’, let’s see
what happens when the tire falls off.
Ah ha!
It acts like it should.
Woo!
Physics.
We can move it around and everything, yeah,
higher physics!
Well, hope you guys enjoyed that fun bug.
So as you guys saw, we had a little case of
the wheel floating away into oblivion - not
quite what the designers wanted - but it was
kinda cool.
The same thing you guys were seeing in the
current build where you blow up a ship and
some debris acts strange or stays still - it
was just because they were getting no mass
- it was an easy fix.
So hope you guys enjoyed and hope you guys
see the- those floating debris’ are gone.
Until next time, bam!
