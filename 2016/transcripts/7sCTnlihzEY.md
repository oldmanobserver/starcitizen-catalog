Chris Roberts (CR): Hello everyone.
Welcome to another episode of 10 for the Chairman.
For those of you who haven’t seen this before,
this is where I answer 10 questions that have
been put forward by the subscribers.
The subscribers are a subset of our community
that contribute money every month to enable
us to do all of our enhanced community content.
So we thank you very much for that because
it really allows us to do a higher degree
of content and pays for a lot of the community
staff and videographers and editors to allow
us to put all the video shows we do every
week and also do the extra amount of updates
on our website and we have also for subscribers
as part of a perk for subscribing there’s
a Jump Point magazine which is usually somewhere
between 40 and 70 pages of behind the scenes
material, how we build and design ships or
how we’re designing a game system or lore
for the world or details about a system and
also some fictional stories that we’ve published.
It’s really a pretty cool read and it has
sort of I guess information a little sooner
than we release to the general overall community
so it’s kind of a perk for being a subscriber
and then there’s also sort of flair that
we add to the hangar and some other areas
in terms of well, thank you for being subscribers
and helping us do all this other stuff so
because of that I also try to answer 10 questions
put forward by the subscribers as the best
of my ability that hopefully gives you a little
insight into where we’re heading or some
of the ideas we have or answer some of the
questions you guys would really like answered.
So the first one comes from.
[01:48] Furry Quandarys asks: It’s been
stated that Squadron 42 is set a few years
before the PU.
So will S42 be set at the current-game year
at the time of its release (ie 2946) and the
PU ahead of the current year.
Or S42 in the past and the PU in the current
year?
Will episode 2 also be set before the PU?
CR: I would think that in general we would
set the Squadron 42 Episode 1, 2 and 3 would
all be set before we start the PU timeline,
I guess is the way to think of it.
So, right now, we do this analogous, it used
to be 2942, now it’s 2946, so we would probably
be setting Squadron 42 in 2942 and between
there and when the PU would start.
Squadron 42, 2942, works pretty well.
[2:58] Zankyri asks: My ship has been boarded
and I cut the gravity generator.
Assuming I still have thrusters and potentially
partial main engines.
I wait until the boarders are inside the ship,
my crew are strapped into crew seats and I
use the thrusters/engines to generate G-force,
pitch, yaw, roll forward, speed, hard stop,
rinse repeat.
If I am able to generate even 25 m/sec potential
boarding parties will be hitting walls at
90 km/hour.Does the game have sufficient physics
to handle this kind of damage implementation,
and how effective would mag boots be in this
scenario?
CR: So that’s definitely, a pretty detailed
question and approach.
So what I will say is that the longer term
plan for the interior grid physics is that
we will simulate a certain amount of external
forces.
So if a ship gets hit we’re planning to
have a bit of that force propagate inside
to the non strapped down or attached entities,
one of which will be players.
So you know that classic Star Wars shot where,
or Star Trek really where the ship gets hit
and everyone sort of staggers and braces themselves
against walls.
That’s all stuff that long term we are planning
on doing.
Part of what we’re doing with the physicalised
EVA is some early stuff that will enable this
combination of animation and procedural physical
reaction to an environment.
So we’ll definitely do some of that and
the bigger ships also in terms of they have
to do a hard turn then what would be probably
do even though they have their own gravity
generators, is that maybe the gravity field
or whatever is slightly laggy for where the
ship position is.
So if you’re turning really fast so that
the gravity in stead of being straight down
is there until it can move back there.
You would have a little bit of this turning
effect.
You see it in classic Star Wars where it’s
like, Empire Strikes Back “Take evasive
action!”.
The two, well actually three Star Destroyers
all do this [gestures with hands] you’ll
see people tilt on one of their bridges.
We’ll try to do a bit of that, I don’t
know if we’re going to do it to the point
where you could generate that much force that
you would, that is being described in this
question.
The idea will be it’s damped it wouldn’t
necessarily be full on, it would be a little
bit of it would bleed into the interior physics
stuff.
Now if you turned all the gravity off inside
the ship, then yes you would be in zero G
and then as things move around you’re not
attached to anything then we would have to
probably, would have to see how to do that,
because generally you would still be in the
interior grid physics.
So we would have to iterate through non attached
entities and essentially keep them in their
relative place within the overall ship.
So basically they would stay in the world
frame reference while the ship itself would
move around.
We can definitely do that but that currently
would require a little extra code.
So I would say longer term that potentially
will happen short term that’s not right
on the immediate horizon for implementation.
And if you had mag-boots that probably would
secure you to something then you wouldn’t
move around.
[6:17] Heavy Metal asks: A while ago, before
the baby PU, there was talk of a ‘Pirate
Swarm’ much like Vanduul Swarm.
I know in some way that is what we find at
the Com arrays in the PU but is there still
a chance of getting that in Arena Commander?
I would love to hone my skills and test weapons
on ships after other than Vanduul, and I would
love to see the larger ships in solo play.
So, Pirate Swarm essentially is what we got
in Crusader.
So, we were sort of building . . at the time
when it was just Arena Commander, we want
to change it around and have maybe some other
modes to fight some other enemies.
In reality the Crusader map, which is the
mini PU map, which is really going to grow
into the Stanton star system map, where we
sort of decided to put these different encounters
whether it was with AI or you could find other
players to fight.
And so that’s essentially where Pirate Swarm
went.
So, in the short term we are not really planning
on doing a lot of work on Arena Commander,
because we really want to get the base game
play and functionality into the proper large
world map, the proper mini PU.
Get the various rock, paper, scissors aspects,
the various different professions, the various
different forces in opposition, and the various
mechanics that keep people aligned whether
you’re good or bad or whatever.
For us Arena Commander, now is a good place
to test some of your dogfighting skills.Longer
term we will add to it.
We will probably add some more challenge modes
and definitely do better matchmaking and make
that more of a competitive practice area.
Of course we’ll do the same thing with Star
Marine, but right now we really just sort
of want to get everything into the mini PU
because that’s sort of our foundation for
the overall game.
Then things will trickle later on into features
for Arena Commander or Star Marine, which
are really meant to be ultimately training
modes for you to train in certain aspects
of the game.
Potentially also to test your skills against
other players without having the same sort
of risk you would have in the proper Persistent
Universe because it’s persistent.
So if you lose things or die, you will lose
them, whereas in Arena Commander or Star Marine
you won't.
[8:24] Zilch asks: How will reconnaissance
work, aside from relaying information through
chat?
Will there be in-game methods for ships to
mark targets either physically or electronically?
Will there be any value in sending ships or
players as operatives in advance of an attacking
force?
CR: So, absolutely, yes, there will be in-game
methods for marking ships.
I think I talked a long time ago and mentioned
quite a few times about sort of the “person
of interest”, and really “person of interest”,
“point of interest” kind of gameplay where
you would sort of tag a ship or tag an individual
and you say “yes, I’m interested in them”.
You could maybe say “Yes, I’m marking
this person for my friends to follow” or
you are going to say “Yes, meet me at this
location” and tag this location and beam
it to your friends.
So, definitely having someone out there sort
of being sort of the eyes and relaying information
to other players cooperatively would be a
big part of gameplay and I think, you know,
it will fall very much in line of what I think
makes Star Citizen special, ‘cause I really
sort of feel, and it’s kind of cool watching
you know, all the people streaming 2.1 and
2.2 and videos people have made where you
really, the –some of the coolest stuff is
people working with each other to do things,
you know.
Helping each other out, rescuing someone,
you know, working in unison to fly a bigger
ship, and of course I mention this all the
time, but those are things that are very high
on the list to make sure, you know, all the
full functionality is there for it ‘cause
we’re still missing a bunch on the multi-crew
functionality and the seats, and all the rest
of stuff, which is being worked on as I speak.
But ,you know, the cooperative nature of the
gameplay is really important for us, and obviously
reconnaissance, and calling out targets, and
all that would be part of it.
[10:02] Darjanator asks: My question is about
scripted non-hostile NPC encounters.
In most games these animations are done with
no regard to player position or actions, but
you’ve said this will not be the case here.
Can we expect NPCs to not just bump into us
if we get in their way during scripted animation?
Will they use some other means to get around
us along their path or make us get our of
their way (maybe based on their personality,
I.E try to squeeze past or ordering you to
get the hell out of their way)?
CR: That’s definitely something that is
big on the list, it’s actually kind of a
core feature to Squadron 42 which will also
be used in the Persistent Universe, but in
general what’s going to happen is the encounters,
characters moving around, it’s not really
going to be just some canned animation that
plays.
What will happen is, AI will have all the
different fragments and pieces of various
things the characters can do and then it sorts
of systematically plays them based on situation,
y’know, where you are with respect to the
character, it can also adjust it’s look
procedurally or his or her look procedurally
on the NPC side.
So if you get in the way then it’ll just
sort of shift into locomotion to avoid you
there will also be co-operative animations
for people trying to squeeze past you, so
we’re really going to try to bring it a
little more life-like.
I think Uncharted, y’know the videos for
the new Uncharted 4 but, Uncharted does a
really good job of this for some of the NPC
moving around with interactions.
We definitely aiming to be there or better.
[11:38] Corrin Avatan asks: In the recent
10 for the Chairman, there was mention of
hacking a terminal to reduce wanted level.
Given that in-universe, there is no FTL communication,
will there be instances where someone can
commit a crime in one system, jump three systems
away, and the local police will scan them,
but not realize they have a criminal, until
the next ‘Criminal Information’ update
comes in via Herald or Reliant News Van?
Yes.
Absolutely, 100 percent.
That is the design.
So even though we recognise that players can
talk to each other on TeamSpeak or Discord
or in channel chat, and that’s basically
instantaneous so it would be faster than light
if you were talking to your buddy in another
system and we can’t block that because you
can always just run an independent program,
we will make sure that all the game systems
themselves propagate properly in the game.
So in terms of your wanted status in the game
or when you are transferring funds or transferring
goods they will all have to move via locations,
to different things, as you would inside the
physical setup of our game.
So yes you could commit a crime, jump out
of there and that may not have reached the
system you’ve got to just yet.
At some point it will, because the information
will travel through the UEE Advocacy network
and you’ll become wanted in that system,
but you’ll maybe be able to “beat” the
information.
But that is also one of the reasons why an
info-runner has a job because on the less
structured systems like … so a more regulated
police system has a lot of communication satellites
and information relays that are used to broadcast
stuff around and then send the little drones
through jump points to the other system which
then broadcasts stuff around but that’s
in the structured infrastructure in the core
of the UEE system … the border ones you
maybe won’t get that or it will only be
in certain areas or patchy and so things like
info-runners will be the courier that comes
and passes information.
So that’s a good reason: maybe you don’t
want the message to get somewhere.
Maybe someone does.
So there’s cool gameplay that comes from
that.
And I think also I should mention that in
2.2 right now we already kind of have a little
bit of this gameplay where you can adjust
your wanted level in Port Kareah and it adds
a goal to be in Port Kareah.
Also taking down or putting up the satellites
basically enables whether there is coverage
in that area.
So whether you commit a criminal act or not,
if the satellite’s down then you can do
what you want, if it’s up and you shoot
someone that you shouldn’t shoot i.e. you
shoot a lawful person, that isn’t wanted,
that doesn’t have a bounty on them, then
you become wanted too.
So that’s the very beginning fundamentals
of the mechanic that we’ll implement in
the bigger system, that will have a lot more
details and nuance to it.
So what we have right now in 2.2 is the first
iteration, which I think is cool because it
provide some structure to the gameplay, but
obviously it’s a crude first implementation.
So for instance we kick you when you are killed
at level five to be your big penalty from
the server now that is not a long term plan
at all.
Long term what will happen is when, depending
on side of the law you fall in, when you essentially
get killed, say when you become an outlaw
you’ll probably respawn in an outlaw friendly
area or planet or asteroid base or whatever.
And at a certain wanted level when you get
killed you basically got captured and you’ll
go to a prison.
And then you’ll have to get out of the prison
by escaping or just serving your time or bribing
someone to come out it.
So we’ll make it more immersive and organic
to the world but short term we needed … because
we don’t have any way to pay people for
money in 2.2 and we don’t really have any
sort of … there’s no persistence so we
don’t really have penalties so we sort of
use the penalty of either locking you in your
room for a little bit or kicking you from
the server.
But that is very short term.
[15:33] PartyFruit asks: Will there be an
achievement feature in the near future (or
at least in the final game)?
If so, would they award the players with anything
(such as weapons, in-game money, decals)?
CR: Alright well so, a couple of things.
Yes long term it’s definitely going to be
in the game but my goal for achievements isn’t
so much the standard like Xbox goals or the
Steam goals.
It’s more the you get in-game mementos.
So you know you visit a location and you got
the snow globe from there.
All those kind of silly things when you fly
to different cities you bring back little
mementos.
That definitely would be an achievement feature
and you would unlock or get certain items
for doing things.
We have a simple thing right now, where you
kill a level five outlaw in the current 2.2
build and you will get a laser rifle.
Which is a short term kind of achievement
thing that you can get.
Of course that’s going to become much more
sophisticated as things go on.
But it will all be based on things that you
would get in the world and kind of holistic
to the world if that makes sense, and not
be some thing on a scoreboard or not like
a little trophy that you get.
That’s the idea of the fish tank and all
those things you have in your hangar it’s
to display your in-game achievements so to
speak.
[16:53] Talinon asks: I really want to know
if there will be a place for people in Squadron
42 and who don’t want to be part of the
FPS but yet still want to be part of the game?
Fortunate to tell you, Talinon, that Squadron
42 has ship combat and FPS and it’s all
sort of blended, so you run around on foot,
you run around flying ships, you basically
fly a Star Pilot so primarily you are going
to be flying missions.
But there will be cases where you land or
you have to EVA to explore a ship, or you’ll
get stuck on a base or an asteroid thing,
and you’ll have to fight your way out.
So it’s really a full seamless blend or
running around on foot, flying ships, interacting
with characters on the ship your based on
or on other locations.
So I don't think there will be an option to
not participate in FPS but do the other things
in SQ42, it’s kind of a holistic experience.
I think it’s gonna be fun, it’s gonna
be good.
We’re obviously not going to make it where
you need to to be the world’s best FPS player
to get through, it’s just going to be a
fun adventure, and I think the fact that you
go between, it’s all from your point of
view and you can do everything as you would
almost in the real world, it’s going to
make it a much more immersive experience than
any of the past Wing Commanders I’ve done.
So, there you go, that’s my answer on that
one.
[18:13] Conflict Viper asks: You’ve mentioned
before that veteran pilots may show their
wear and tear with replacement limbs, has
there been any thought to allowing pilots
to augment their bodies with replacement limbs
to allow for higher G endurance and less chance
of a blackout during space combat?
CR: Yes, we have discussed that.
I mean, we are, you know, longer term going
to have replacement limbs and parts spare
so you kind of have certain cyborg-y action
that’s going on.
We have talked about potential to get a better
G suit that will let you have higher G tolerances.
Potentially, if you have, you know, some augmented
body part.
Perhaps that would help you too.
So, long term, we have discussed that, and
probably will be something long term, but
short term, No.
That would definitely be part of character
customization in our overall long-term plan.
[19:09] Apportioner asks: Will players be
able to participate in the UEE or any other
faction’s elections?
Can a player run for office in the UEE?
CR: I guess we have that because we’re in
the process, in America anyway of nominating
the various candidates for the next presidency
of the United States and hopefully our UEE
elections will be less dramatic than the ones
happening here in the U.S.
But this is early days for us on this.
We definitely felt that being a citizen would
give you some rights, and one of the rights
would be able to, vote or have some effect
on general things in the same way, I guess
you do in the real world.
Which is pretty not that much!
So that is a longer term goal to have some
participation in that.
Probably will be Game Mastered by us, because
we’re planning to besides just having the
simulation of the universe we also hand push
it and guide it towards, ‘cause we have
an overall story and timeline we have in our
minds for Star CItizen.
So we’ll create events and elections and
seismic change events in the universe that
will potentially affect players and AI.
One of those could be elections.
I don’t think we’ll in the short term
anyway, have a player run for the office in
the United Empire of Earth but again long
term you never know.
We’re pretty big on player agency and participation.
A lot of the fun that I see happening in the
SC Alpha 2.1 and 2.2 is players doing stuff
and creating content for other players and
we’re pretty big on that.
That’s our whole sort of mission.
Our world system is built up to react to what
players and AI is doing and based on that
it generates other missions, so it’s sort
of a feedback loop.
So getting players involved in other things
is good.
So longer term potentially, you never know
I think they have a version of players involved
in EvE in terms of running things as well.
So I think as we said something we’re planning
long term but we are going to give you benefits
for being a citizen to allow you to participate
or get certain things that you wouldn’t
if you weren’t a citizen.
And of potentially would be voting for this
person or that person and then depending on
which one you voted for, as an AI character
it could have an impact on how the world unfolds
in Star Citizen.
So that’s kind of the fun element we’re
thinking that we really again player’s themselves
doing things, changing, affecting the world
and the game or us as Game Masters reacting
to that, keeping it fluid and dynamic should
be fun!
Outro
There’s the ten questions for this episode
of this 10 for the Chairman, this is the last
episode I will be doing for a few weeks.
I’m actually already in the UK now, this
is recorded in the past before I left but
I am now in a much colder and rainier place
than Los Angeles.
I will restart it as soon as I am back in
LA, back and forth with my schedule, hope
the questions that I answered were informative
for you guys and my answers were good.
Thank you to all the subscribers for backing,
first of all allowing us to do this enhanced
community content, and all the backers in
general for backing the game and allowing
us to make a game of the ambition and scope
that we’re doing.
A lot of these questions are not normally
questions that most games would ever be able
to say, “Yes, we’ll do” and one of the
reasons why we say, “Yes, we’re going
to do it” maybe not always doing it tomorrow
but it’s on the plan is because of the support
you guys have done.
You’re enabling us to build a game of the
scope and scale no one would normally in their
right mind take on but I think it’s going
to be awesome when it’s all said and done.
Anyways, it’s been nice talking to you guys
and I will talk to you in a few weeks time.
Take care, bye.
