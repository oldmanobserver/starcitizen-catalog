Mark Abent: Hey everyone, it’s early in
the morning, we’re here to crack some bugs
down on good ole Citizen Con.
Going to do some bug fix fixed, all for your
fixing needs, going to fix all those bugs.
Let’s go.
Hey everyone, we’re here in our super secret
test level with the Gladius and invisible
ship.
So, we got a bug here about all the enter
animations being offset, this happened after
all the animators switched the enter animations
to this new fast enter animation.
So, you can quickly get into your ship and
it doesn’t take forever.
So let’s turn on our AI physics and I have
my little pilot guy here, our ship’s going
to dance around and we’re going to tell
him to enter and I’m going to actually scale
down and you can see, oh kinda missed it there.
Let’s try it again, weee, you’ll be able
to see as this plops down he’s supposed
to grab onto the bars and propel himself into
the ship.
He doesn’t quite do that, so as you can
see he kinda missed the bar there, it’s
kind of penetrating and as he gets in the
seat he has a little offset and he snaps.
This is happening across all the ships, there’s
a slight little offset so let’s watch that
again.
He just decided to float into the air.
So real time, he’ll grab on and oh that
time he fully missed on the right hand.
So he grabbed right before and he propelled
himself up.
Then when he gets in he like has a small little
gap between his thigh and his seat, so there’s
a global issue that affects all of the enters
and it’s just a slight offset and it’s
not inside the actual animation.
So, all the animators were going nuts going,
they set up everything, they synced everything,
they even placed these things called animobjects
that lined up correctly and they’re like,
‘all right, we got to send this off to an
engineer cause there’s obviously some weird
offset’ and fortunately there was.
So, what our set up, let’s go back into
here.
What I’m doing actually is when a player
gets into this enter animation, what we do
is on the ship there is a position roughly
where our character is and what we do is,
is we attach our player to that position and
then we have the player move relative to that
attachment point and that gives the illusion
that you’re still in… he’s actually
in that little enter position but we’re
moving him and when he sits down we teleport
the attachment to where he’s sitting.
So give the illusion that you’re sitting
when you move and all that fun stuff and you
just move relative to the attachment which…
it works out pretty nice but when you have
this weird offset issue, you get this bad
snapping so when you finally sit down and
when it teleports to the actual sit thing
you get this teleport and it just looks unnatural.
So, what’s happening, well here is our animated
character or what our player does to figure
out where he’s going to move next.
This desired animation movement block of code,
what it does is it looks at the... basically
the skeleton to see roughly what movement
we’re going to do.
So, as we’re here every frame we have a
little bit of movement.
Movement, movement, movement, movement until
we get to our seat and that’s what basically
this calculate relative movement does and
this block of code ideally you just want to
do a current frame to get to a current movement
so you can work your way up.
Unfortunately this block of code actually
get used for the usual standard player movement
and they have to use this prediction block
where it samples the current frame and the
next frame, the reason why is if you’re
not on the seat attachment, you’re just
generally moving around it actually figures
out where you need to go and it sends this
information to physics and physics runs here
and the main thread where this animation runs
here.
They run parallel and between each other so
they’re not quite in sync so we have to
get some future information so we can send
to it so it can run even if it runs ahead
or behind the main thread.
So, we need an extra sample and unfortunately
that breaks one attachment cause we’re not
actually going through the physics side, we’re
going through the attachment side to figure
out where we need to move the player.
So we don’t need this extra bit of prediction
and that’s actually where our offset is
happening because we’re not sampling here,
we’re sampling ahead double so we’re going
places we shouldn’t be going.
So, what we have to do is do something sniffy
like, should use movement prediction and by
default we want to use it if we have our Cvar,
but we also don’t want to use it if we have
the first step to an attachment.
So, if the movement Cvar for prediction is
enabled and we do not have an attachment then
we do this movement prediction.
Otherwise we just sample the timeframe.
So, do some recode, all right recode is done
and let’s see how it looks when we only
sample the current frame instead of the future
frame.
Up… recode broke.
So unfortunately recode sometimes breaks the
game so I have to restart the editor.
All right, so recode had some issues so I
had to restart the editor, let’s try this
again.
Let me turn on the Cvar, wham.
All right, got into position, let’s have
the pilot enter and see what happens.
Slow motion...bam, oh he grabbed the ladder,
yeah.
He hops in, he grabs the side correctly, sits
in the seat on the correct position, wooo.
Everything works better, a lot better.
There is still kind of a snap between the
end of the enter and the idle that’s something
that the animators have to work at but the
whole offset between the entering and getting
inside is there Cvar is gone, done.
Just slight little programming and bam, we
got good results.
All right, hope you guys enjoyed this little,
small fun bug.
There was a global issue with seats entering,
they switched over to the new combat animations
and things were just not lining up/ The animators
were going bonkers and then they decided to
shift the bug over to engineering, they took
a quick look at it.
Some slight issues with the movement prediction,
turns out we don’t even need that prediction
when attached, so disabled it when we’re
attached, the problem went away you’re able
to get in, grab onto the ladder, animations
all lined up good to go.
Animators can take a sigh of relief and all
the animations look great.
Hope you guys enjoyed, till next time, bugsmashing.
