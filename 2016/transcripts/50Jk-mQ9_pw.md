Chris Roberts (CR): Hello, thanks for joining
us here at CIG for another Around the ‘Verse,
the weekly look behind the scenes at everything
Star Citizen.
I’m Chris Roberts.
Sandi Gardiner (SG): And I’m Sandi Gardiner.
For those of you keeping track, we’re just
a little over a week away from this years
CitizenCon.
CR: Yes we are.
So as we continue working towards the big
event, team members from every studio will
be arriving here in L.A. next week.
It’s going to be a really full house, hard
to believe how much we’ve grown since last
CitizenCon here in L.A.
SG: Yeah it is, and to find out all the latest
details for the event make sure you check
out the RSI site.
We have a post that outlines everything from
where to watch the livestream online to trophies,
to what backers attending in person can expect.
CR: Yup, absolutely so check that out.
Every department and team have been working
really hard to make sure this year's CitizenCon
is a memorable one.
SG: Very cool and of course you’ll have
to wait till the livestream next week to see,
but don’t worry, with a whole universe being
created there’s still plenty left to share.
CR: There is always lots to share.
So right now let's go visit the U.K. to get
an update on some of the latest efforts underway
at Foundry 42.
Studio Update
Mici Oliver (MO): Hi everyone and welcome
back to the UK.
I’m Mici Oliver, QA Tester to give you this
week’s studio update.
After a successful show at Gamescom, the team
have been working really hard on the 2.6 content
and also some exciting new things to show
you at Citizencon.
First up, we’ve got David and Will to talk
about the improvements to the scanners and
the radar systems - let’s take a look.
Will Maiden (WM): So radar scanning is a very
fundamental mechanic - so many of the careers
are going to be based off it.
Not just combat but policing and smuggling,
mining, exploration - they are all going to
be using radar and scanning in some way or
another so making sure that this system works
for all of them can and compliments them and
feels natural has been an interesting challenge
to overcome not just in space but on foot
as well.
So whether you are in Star Marine or you are
just exploring a planet for the first time,
the system needs to work in every case.
So, having an eye on working for the future
but what do we have right now and making sure
we don’t ruin an already good experience
has been an interesting challenge to overcome
and something we have I think at some point
five or six different disciplines are all
contributing to making sure that we’re not
overlooking one area to make one other area
better.
So it’s a continued system that’s been
in development and something that I think
we are going to need the community’s feedback
on.
David Pollard (DP): We’ve been breaking
it down into different tiers so the cross
section you take the 3D shape that you are
detecting and it works out the dimensions
that you can actually see and it gives you
a result from that.
So if you’re looking at a ship from top
down it’ll have a bigger cross section and
side-on it’ll be a smaller signal that gets
to you.
As well as cross sections we got infrared
and electromagnetic which are systematically
worked out from the items on the object that
you are picking up on the radar and so the
different items draw different amounts of
power and give out different amounts of heat
and that’s all added together and then radar
looks at that signal and works out how much
of it it can see to determine whether it is
detected or not.
For the FPS we’re thinking of adding- we’re
working on adding a decibel signal as well
for sound so if there are guys walking around
a corridor or firing weapons they’ll be
making sound - that will feed into the radar
signal system which means we can use the same
radar on a player as on a ship and it basically
uses the same code under the hood.
Fundamentally the ships and player radars
are the same, because it is all systematic
and players- player characters, NPCs all have
items on them in the same way that ships do,
they also emit infrared and EM in the same
way based on the power draw of their life
support systems and helmets and weapons.
So we’ve- in the past we’ve had just passive
radar on ships and with Will’s design we’ve
been adding new features as well which the
active ping - which allows you to send out
a pulse which amplifies the signals that your
passive radar might not be able to pick up
and so I’ve implemented it.
It’s done on a golf-swing type mechanic
where you hold down the button, wait for it
to charge up and if you get it right, let
go, then it sends out a ping that is much
more powerful than the passive radar and that-
with the active ping the last quarter of the
power up power is the sweet spot you gotta
get.
If you don’t quite get there then- by letting
go too early or if you don’t let go in time
then that’s when it sends out a really loud
signal which other people could detect and
the guys in LA are going to be taking over
this scanning and radar stuff and running
with it - it’ll be good to see what they
do.
WM: Up until now we’ve had a system in-place
that works great for combat, you can- a ship
will come into range and you can pick it up
and then it tells you everything you need
to know about it - who it works for and the
name of the ship and you can fight it straight
away.
But moving forward we’re going to need to
know specific information that you can gather
from a scan - what it’s cargo is, and things
like that and you took the system out and
we started to implement some of those new
features and we keep them all robust and future-proof
so when we start working on it for the future
careers that stuff is already solid groundwork.
We’re going to be seeing a lot more scanning
and radar focused ships- more utility ships
I guess, say, where the focus isn’t on combat
but gathering of information - we’ve seen
it recently with the Terrapin, we’ve also
got the Freelancer DUR and the Constellation
Aquila - ships that are designed for exploration
or data gathering - that are going to have
additional utility mounts used specifically
for scanning or increasing radar range - that
allows them to capture information but also
bounty hunters can scan a ship - look who
is onboard, find out their criminal status
- but also on the other side, smugglers need
to be aware of the system so they know how
to trick it, how to stay hidden - spies need
to know how to keep themselves quiet and disappear
off radar so it’s a two system of “I improve
my systems one way” and then this guy is
trying to quiet himself down.
One of the things we are looking at is the
ability to scout ahead so a ship might jump
ahead, recon an area, gather information about
what forces have been gathered and then bring
that back to the rest of the fleet where they
can make a valid judgement of “OK, they
are exposed on this side” or “actually,
no, they are too strong, let’s leave it”
but it means that you can start to plan out
larger attacks and have multiple stages of
“oh, I’ve bought a Herald to gather information
quickly and run but maybe not fight” and
now there’s a value in having those recon
ships as part of your fleet, as part of your
group’s collection.
And also if you don’t want to fight it yourself,
you can sell that information to the police
or to other gangs who may want to act on that
information.
MO: Next up we’ve got Vehicle Artist, Paul,
to show you some cool alterations we’ve
made to the Vanguard to make a dropship called
the Hoplite.
Paul Dalessi (PD): I was given the task of
creating a new dropship for Squadron 42 - the
Vanguard was chosen to be a source material
for that - the Vanguard originally has a pod
in the middle that can eject and be given
different functionalities for different variants
- that plan wouldn’t work for a dropship
variant, you have to strip out all the walls
to make space for the seats to make sure people
can walk inside the interior space easily.
We’ve put in the bigger ramp so people can
get in and out easier, bring in some cargo
- a lot more space - the original Vanguard
had a bit of a tapered ramp, you can only
get in one person at a time - new bigger one
you can just walk in with four people at the
same time no problem - it’ll be a much easier
fit.
It’s not displacing any work, it’s not
going to delay anything, it’s just going
to help Squadron 42 come out faster.
The Vanguard Warden’s black - default Aegis
black - the Hoplite is green, it’s a UEE
ship - it’s a UEE dropship so it comes in
the UEE livery of green similar to the Gladius.
The Warden variant had middle pod which was
an escape pod, it had beds in it, the dropship
does not have that, it is it’s own unique
variant, it doesn’t have swappable pod in
the middle, it’s got essentially the same
weapons capabilities, the same turret on top,
it’s just that the internals have changed
and it’s got a bigger loading ramp.
MO: A lot for you guys to discuss.
That’s everything for this week, so thank
you for watching - I hope you enjoyed our
updates and we’ll see you in the ‘Verse.
Back to the Studio
CR: Thanks for the update Mici, and to the
team for taking their time to show their work
cause they’ve been working very hard on
Citizencon work right now.
SG: Yep, it was really great to see the Vanguard
transform actually and it sounds like the
radar and scanning update is going to unlock
some pretty cool and big gameplay.
CR: Yes - definitely and so it’s one of
the things I’m really excited by because
it’s going to add a whole extra dimension
to the Squadron 42 gameplay that I didn’t
have in Wing Commanders and then if you take
it to the Star Citizen side of the Persistent
Universe, it’s opening up a whole host of
options in exploration, in piracy, in policing,
enforcement so it’s going to be really cool.
SG: Very cool and definitely I’m going to
need someone to do the scan operator on my
Connie.
CR: Yes, I’ve got a feeling skilled scanner
operators are going to be in high demand.
I’ll will perhaps train to be your Scanner
Operator, we’ll see.
SG: Wow.
Now we’ve gotten a glimpse of what our devs
have been up to - let’s take a look at the
hard work you guys have been doing - here’s
this week’s Community Update with Tyler
in Austin.
Community Update w/Tyler Witkin
Tyler Witkin (TW): Hey everyone.
Tyler Witkin, Community Manager in the Austin,
Texas studio, here to bring you this week's
Community Update.
Last week the Aegis Retaliator won the title
of Galactic Tour's Bomber of the Year, landing
it a spot on our pledge store for one week,
and that sale ends tomorrow.
Fast forward to this week and now we have
the Sabre verse the Delta competing for the
title of Galactic Tour's Dogfighter of the
Year.
We're going to post the results of that poll
on our website tomorrow.
Now I know we've been talking a lot about
Bar Citizens lately.
Just last Saturday there was an event in Denver,
Colorado; Vienna, Austria and Rennes, France
that all look to be an incredible time.
And thanks to the efforts of a citizen named
Ricko, you can now go to BARCITIZEN.SC to
find all the news and updates about Bar Citizens
around the globe.
The site is jam-packed with information and
even an interactive map to help you find events
in your area.
Speaking of Bar Citizens we're going to be
hosting two official events the weekend of
CitizenCon, Friday and Saturday night.
You can find out all the details about those
events on the CitizenCon information page,
which is on our website now.
Now it's time for this week's MVP award.
A huge congratulations to Leadhead for his
extraordinary efforts in creating a 300i sand
sculpture.
This was a week long endeavor, and they even
had to battle it out with some rain, but it
turned out fantastic.
So congratulations again Leadhead, you're
this week's MVP.
Lastly the week would not be complete without
Reverse the Verse so make sure to tune in
live tomorrow at 8:00 AM Pacific Daylight
Time at Twitch.TV/CIGCommunity where we're
going to talk about everything that you saw
on today's episode.
Thanks again everyone for your support.
We'll see you in the 'Verse.
Back to Studio
SG: Wow, that sand sculpture was awesome.
Between 3V, 3D printing, oil paintings, Legos,
wood carvings and now sand I'm excited to
see what the community will create next.
CR: Yes, well maybe they'll have a Close Encounters
tribute next.
You never know.
SG: Never know.
Now I'm trying to figure out which ship would
look good shaped out of mashed potatoes.
CR: Yes, made by Richard Dreyfuss.
So speaking of shaping ships, let's catch
up with Andrew Nicholson and Jonny Jacevicius
in the U.K. to hear all about the new improvements
they've been making on the flight model.
Ship Shape: Flight Model Balance
Andy Nicholson (AN): For the upcoming 2.6
patch we want to start digging into balance
on a larger scale than we have done before.
Go back to the drawing board a little bit
- not too far obviously - so that meant finding
out where do we start?
What’s the first thing we do?
There’s always dependencies with everything,
so try and find the fundamental thing that
we might end up changing that’s going to
affect a lot of other things.
The flight model was that thing.
And what we decided, and what we started to
do to test it, was to pick one ship - we picked
the Gladius - we lowered the SCM speed to
try and make combat, not really slower, but
a little easier to control so you’re not
flying backwards and forth at really high
speeds.
I mean the Newtonian physics that we use,
the IFCS flight model is complicated - it’s
complex - it allows for a lot of depth to
the combat, but it’s also kind of intimidating.
Especially when you’ve got an SCM speed
of 350.
You’ve got ships going really fast and a
lot of throttle management to do to get decent
in combat.
So we took the Gladius, we lowered the speeds
down to, I think, about 140 - it’s like
a rough halving of the speeds to see how it
would affect gameplay.
And then rebalanced a few ships around that.
Okay make everything slower how does that
feel in a dogfight situation?
And also, not just speeds wise, but we sped
up the accelerations so the stop times were
lower.
Which meant there was less slide when it comes
to ship maneuverability.
It can take a little bit of time to get to
top acceleration when you are turning so that
even … that staggers the speeds as well.
It makes everything feel heavier.
Gives the ships more character.
But to fill that gap where we’ve cut into
the SCM speeds we’ve made some changes to
the afterburner.
We’ll be making further changes to the afterburner,
but we wanted to tweak the fuel limit on that
so people used it more.
The idea that in a combat situation if you’re
not moving fast enough or you need to escape
faster afterburner’s what you’d use now
because ... it should be like a … something
you don’t use all the time, something you
use every now and that then, that just gets
you out of a combat situation if you need
to.
Afterburner didn’t really have that much
of a purpose before: now it does.
We set up some tests where all the Designers
were invited to playtest and see what their
opinions of it were.
And it was mostly positive, you know, say
overwhelmingly positive, which has meant we’ve
put together a patch, based on the 2.5 build,
so it’s like an interim patch that includes
fixes, well rebalancing of, the ships’ speed.
But we’ll go out to the Evocati for them
to playtest and give us feedback on that.
And eventually more players will get to try
it too if it’s favourable.
Or, you know, if it’s not we’ll still
try and make changes based on that too.
Ship flight, ship handling, is the main fundamental.
What we build upon from there is … in ship
balancing will be ship shields, ship health,
missiles and weapons.
Right now I’m starting to look at weapons
but we’ve already done a pass which should
be in the Evocati build as well on shields.
And what we did was … we’ve got some preplanned
numbers - future numbers - where we wanted
to take the shields later when they’ve been
redeveloped and refactored and we ported them
into the old system we have with the shields,
which should mean we get a little taster of
how those shield classes might perform.
I expect there’ll be a lot of feedback on
that and there’ll be a lot to change but
that’s why we did it.
It’s a good chance for Evocati to get there
hands on it and go “er, that’s not quite
right” and we’ll react to that when we
can.
But yeah the missile changes I think Jonny
will be talking a bit more about that.
Jonny Jacevicius (JJ): So the problem we have
with our current missile rack system is a
lot of the missile racks are bespoke to ships
and that they’re tied onto them, you can’t
swap them out for any others.
You can swap the missiles in and out but we’d
rather you had the choice to be able to swap
it out for a different rack of a different
size so you can put different size missiles
on there if you prefer more smaller ones or
a less amount of larger missiles.
Another problem is a lot of the size allocations
we had on the missile racks that we’ve got
at the moment is that some would be size three
that could hold, for example, two size three
missiles, and some would be size two that
could hold two size three missiles.
So we really just wanted to bring all that
in line, fix the problems with that, and then
obviously build a system that’s flexible
enough to allow you to swap in and out these
missile racks.
Say for example if you don’t have a ship
that has a bespoke missile rack on there,
like the Starfarer Gemini the rack on the
front or the Constellation wings, you’ll
be able to use one of these new missile racks.
The Frankfurt lads have been working very
hard on actually making all of the missiles
the correct size.
So all size one missiles, instead of being
huge … having huge variances in sizes, they’ll
all now be the same size but we’ll still
have the opportunity to make them look unique.
And this just means that instead of having
these different sized missiles floating away
from missile racks they’ll actually be connected
to the missile racks properly, will disconnect
properly, and it will look good.
If you play something like an FPS you’ll
have your sniper rifle as something that is
the long ranged, powerful shot weapons.
You’ll have your SMG that is your burst
like … kind of like high rate of fire, lower
damage, high spread weapon.
You’ll have a shotgun that’s high spread,
very high damage.
So we wanted to reflect that in our ship weapons
so that if someone is using a cannon you immediately
know that they’ll be trying to engage you
with it from long range.
A repeater: you’ll have an idea of what
the fire rate will be, how much damage it
will cause and things like that.
So that’s not to say that all cannons will
be the same and all repeaters will be the
same.
All of the … there are many different things
that can have varying effects on the ship
weapon statistics.
So if it’s, for example, an energy weapon
over a ballistic weapons it might fire faster,
it might consume more power.
And if it’s … say if it’s … if you’ve
got additional things under energy, say additional
damage types under energy - so if it’s a
laser weapon, if it’s a plasma weapon - there’ll
be different attributes to the projectile
it fires but also to possibly the gun’s
rate of fire, it’s power consumption, it’s
accuracy and all of these things.
We want to get these changes in on our current
set of weapons just to make sure that we can
get those locked down first and make sure
we get them feeling good with the new flight
model.
And then, in the near future, we’ll hopefully
start getting some of these … getting some
more variation in there, getting some of these
additional damage types in, and making these
weapons feeling more and more unique.
Back in the Studio
SG: Yeah I can’t wait for the players to
test all the tweaks first hand when we implement
this into the Alpha.
Do you think people are going to have to adjust
their flying styles as these adjustments come
in?
CR: Yeah, no absolutely.
Actually I think it’s going to give a much
more fun, close feel … up close feel to
the dogfighting.
Which is what we’ve been looking for: that
visceral Wing Commander feel.
And of course we’ve got these beautiful
ships that Nate and his whole ship team build
and we want to show that off and …
It’s actually kind of ironic because it’s
exactly the process I ended up going through
24 years ago when we were doing Strike Commander.
So Strike Commander wasn’t based in space,
it was modern jet fighters in this futuristic
vision of the Earth where mercenary squadrons
were working for the highest bidder or the
corporation.
And we’d based it all on … we’d done
accurate flight modelling and all the speeds
and everything were based on what an F16 would
be, or a MIG 25 or the various craft that
you would be … fighter planes you would
be fighting with.
But we found when we were flying around and
dogfighting that we really weren’t getting
this up close dogfighting feel that we wanted
and Wing Commander had from what was done
previously.
And, yeah, it wasn’t helped by the fact
that resolution was really low - 320 by 200
- and 256 colours.
So we were trying … we were wracking our
heads to see how we could do that better and
we basically said “let’s try halving the
speed of … basically the distance and speed
of everything”.
And when we did that it felt right.
So even though it wasn’t fully, actually
accurate and right it was … it felt good
as a dogfighter up close, firing guns.
And that’s kind of the same process we went
through here on the flight model changes we’ve
done.
So we’ve … the speed’s crept up over
time and everyone gets further and further
apart.
And now we’re bringing them back together
for a more up close, Wing Commander style
dog fighting but with a much more sophisticated
physics model and all the rest of stuff.
And so hopefully people are going to like
it but that’s up to the Community - it’s
the process we do.
So the first up will be the Evocati and see
what they like, and then after that a larger
group of the Community.
But we’re pretty excited by it.
SG: Wow, that sounds like I am going to need
to up my Arena Commander game.
Which fortunately is a little easier thanks
to Zane and Trevor and speaking of those guys
we now go to a first look at the work they’ve
been doing on our brand new lobby interface.
UI Update: Lobby and Mobiglas
Treavour Wernisch (TW): The initial user experience
and the onboarding experience in Star Citizen
kind of needed a fresh look, actually an entire
overhaul.
So, we’re sort of burning the old system
to the ground and rebuilding it all from scratch
visually and from a code base.
So, user experience is a lot cleaner and should
be more fun to use.
So, the initial pass will be launching in
2.6, internal feedback has been great so far.
We anticipate the user base will be just as
excited, you should be able to match up with
your friends quicker, jump into the lobby
much quicker, you’ll be able to customize
your marine in Star Marine now.
It’ll have unique loadouts for the different
factions.
A big focus of the revision is having big
hero pieces.
We have really unique and detailed planetary
system Star Marine models and Arena Commander
ships.
So, kind of to bring out those hyper details
we want to spin around models, zoom in on
that or just kind of a get a feel for how
amazingly they’re built.
We want to do some really interesting fullscreen
ship customization here, the system’s still
pretty heavy under development but gives you
an idea of, you know, we’ll be able to spin
around ships, focus in on parts and switch
out items.
You’ll be able to drill down individual
items and gets those item stats when you’re
swapping them in and out of your ship.
So with the visual redesign we’re actually
going to bring the leader boards from the
web into the game so players have less reason
to jump in and out when they’re tracking
their score on the leader board.
With bringing the leader boards in game, we’re
going to actually try to expand out the system
and build a bigger feature set for users to
track.
We’re going to have official ranking systems
and matchmaking, will be a lot more improved.
A few months ago our Lead Designer, Zane already
showed concept… visual concepts on where
we want to take Mobiglas so we’ve taken
those concepts and started to flesh them out
ingame.
We have a working prototype in game and we’re
kind of building different applications now.
The mission management system and inventory
systems to kind of build a baseline style
guide, make sure everything is readable and
legible in all kinds of different types of
environments.
Just a really fun unique system to use.
Zane Bien(ZB): Reason why we kind of wanted
to do this overhaul was to make the Mobiglas
feel a bit more inworld.
That includes utilizing more of the arm to
communicate that this UI is associated with
your arm and the projector.
TW: One of the great features from Mobiglas
we’re trying to build out now is while everybody
has come to know the blue LED visual style
that we have, we’re looking to implement
a feature that will let a feature kind of
customize the colour to their liking so if
there is any issues with the blue they can
make it their pink or purple that they want.
ZB: We also have this idea of adding more
customization into the home screen so what
you’ll be able to is much like a support
screen in the ship is customize what different
blocks displace.
So we have just these kind of placeholder
live elements here, so anything can then go
in each of these little blocks here and you’ll
be able to customize what displays where.
So, eventually we’ll have… you’ll be
able to kind of drag one of these apps here
whether it’s like your UEC, bank account
or cargo manager, your StarMap and you drag
it into one of these blocks and what that’ll
do is turn it into a real… overall status
display for that application.
As you can see this is our initial implementation,
you can see it’s very much a work in progress
then after 2.6 I’m excited to get this out
to you guys so you guys can play around with
it and test it.
We’re expecting it to come in roughly around
3.0, so it’ll be exciting.
Outro
CR: Really cool work on the lobby and also
the mobi customization, a great way to end
the show.

Star Citizen, we could not do this without
you.
CR: Yes, we definitely couldn’t so thank
you guys.
So be sure to join us for Reverse the Verse
tomorrow at 8am Pacific, aka 4pm GMT, aka
5pm Frankfurt time where Johnny and Andrew
will be providing further detail on the flight
model changes.
Make sure to have your questions ready.
SG: Yup have them ready and while there will
be a brand new Loremakers next week, ATV and
RTV will be on Hiatus so we can focus on preparations
for CitizenCon.
CR: Yes, there’s lots of preparations in
process.
So make sure to tune into our livestreams
next Friday and Saturday and of course the
big event on Sunday.
I’m excited to share with you everything
that we’ve been working on, it’s pretty
awesome.
SG: And again head to the RSI website for
all the details on how to watch and more.
CR: So until then, we’ll see you…
Both: Around
