Mark Abent: Hey everyone, welcome back to
Bug Smashers.
As you can see, it didn’t get cancelled
yet.
I was just taking a little rest, some PTO,
some vacation, you know, good on the beach.
Welcome back, so let's get started, fix some
bugs and makes some bugs our bitch.
Okay, hey everyone we’re here in good old
dying star and we have a little fun bug with
the projectiles where if I strafe a bit you’ll
notice they’re not correctly in sync with
this ship.
They kind of delay a little bit which seems
right, but it’s actually wrong because … yes
when you drift, you think the projectiles
are lagging because the ship moves, but the
projectiles are actually getting the velocity
of the ship so if I have a constant velocity
they should move together.
What’s actually happening is, in our game
level update where right here in the middle,
so the top of the frame is here, middle of
the frames here, below the frame.
This is where we would do our updates for
the entities and we’re actually creating
our projectile right here.
So in the update we create our projectile,
cool, it’s gets the position and all that
stuff from our weapon and it appears right
in front of our gun, then the frame continues
and now we’re at the very end where all
of our animations update so if our gun or
turret moved it was now over here and it’s
over here.
So if we shot a projectile this way, I’m
just going use this little pen.
So if I shot a projectile this way and at
creation time it’s like this, but now we
get our animation update, turrets here, Uh
oh, or what happens if I have a wing that’s
way like this, I shoot, but now the wings
over here and they’re not in sync.
Then it gets worse, the frame ends, next frame
happens and our entity system updates and
it moves our ship from like here to here for
flying.
So our projectile that’s here and that creation
spawn, now is over here, but our projectiles
over here.
So then the frame happens all over again and
what you basically see is in the first frame
it’s kind of off center, the next frame
it’s really off center and it just gets
worse because we’re a frame behind.
This was a problem that we’ve had since
the stop and we’ve kind of had hacks and
fixes that we threw in there to kind of line
it up, but it never worked right.
An example of this is in the previous patch
we had the Freelancer with it’s two guns
in the middle and if you strafed left or right,
because of the frame syncing issue, the projectile
could actually end up inside of the entity
grid of the ship and then the ship moves again
and then the projectile just flies off.
So my ships facing this way, it should shoot
forward, but instead the projectile now shoots
like this because ... it just gets all messed
up.
So what we have to fix this is a couple of
things.
We have this new underlying system that the
good old folks in the UK.
I think it was Steven North and Humphreys,
might have been Chris bolte, anyways there’s
some good guys in the two other studios that
worked on this they called the “Load Manager”.
What it is like alright I want to spawn this
entity, but we’re going to wait until all
the resources are ready so we no longer stall
and we don’t have to preload things all
in the very beginning of the game, we can
preload on demand and once everything has
been preloaded, we can then spawn the entity
more higher up in the frame when physics and
the entity are in sync.
So we’re no longer creating the entity down
here, we’re creating it on top.
Now it can happen a frame or two later, that’s
fine because we had to preload, but we’re
at the top of the creation where everything
is good.
Unfortunately while we have synced up physics
and the entity, here’s our ship and if it
was here and now it’s here that’s cool,
however our guns are still over here because
the animation update is at the end and the
animation actually moves all the attachments
so that moves our gun.
So while we are spawning in the correct location
we do need this extra bit of code here and
the fire mode, that goes alright our entity
position is right, but our guns are wrong,
but we know where they’re going to be built
because we have item ports which define how
the ship gets made and what gets connected
to what.
So we can theoretically just build all the
transforms, so if I’m on my weapon and I
know the local transform or how I’m related
to the turret, I know that little bit I can
keep doing that up until I get up to the top
crew and then take that transformation and
apply it to where the ship really is.
So if we do that bad boy which I just uncommented
that disabled, I’m re enabling it.
This guy what this guy basically does as it
says is I go through each of the ports, I
build up the local transform and then I finally
apply it to the entity of world space, I inject
it into the physics code because we’re now
in sync and let's see what that gives us.
There we go, alright recode is finish so let's
move to the left and as you can see, the projectiles
are moving with the ship.
There actually was another bit of code I added
which also takes into account the acceleration
of the ship on the current time.
So as our ships moves with the acceleration
we now correctly predict and it lines up better,
but overall you see the projectiles moving
with the ship because of that lovely correct
spawn position and then rebuilding all the
information and the bonus of this is if I
have a Freelancer, my big guns will now shoot
off to the correct location even if I’m
twirling and moving and all that fun stuff.
The added bonus is we can now enable the ability
for the ship to hit itself.
Before because the projectile could spawn
anywhere, it could hit anything, now that
we’re fixing all this stuff up, we could
enable ships to hit itself which will add
to some fun, fun times.
Well I hope you guys enjoyed this bug, it
was a pretty exciting one.
Especially since we’re getting all this
technology that we’ve been building through
the years finally all coming together and
we’re starting to use it now to solve old
problems like this projectile bug.
We’re going to keep doing that as we get
newer technology and updating our newer systems
so hopefully I’ll have more stuff to show
you guys, hope you guys enjoyed, see you next
time.
