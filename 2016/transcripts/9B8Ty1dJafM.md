[Music]
hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers my
name is Mark aent I'm gameplay
programmer here at Cloud Imperium games
Los Angeles and if you guys never seen
this before it's pretty cool I take you
behind the scenes of some fancy bugs
that disrupt you know your guys'
playtime and even some designers or even
our stuff and you know it's pretty cool
to see what happens and why and I give
you a quick breakdown of what's
happening and the fix well hope you guys
enjoy let's take a
look box
[Music]
bashes hey everyone we're here in my
fancy dance test level and Bob here is
annoying me so I'm going to get rid of
him goodbye Bob all right so we're here
to test out a fun crash bug when certain
entities get destroyed um if Bob goes
away he may crash but to speed up this
process we are going to
spawn fun
constellation
constellation I'm going to shoot the
crap out of it and hopefully we can get
a crash that QA was reporting so
apparently uh with this bug when you
destroy and delete things we're getting
a crash with some corrupt memory so
let's see if we could replicate that
everything is
[Music]
dancing ah and crash
excellent so what's happening here well
uh when we try to remove these entities
uh we get this thing called an event
done and this gets dispatched to all
sorts of systems to say hey clean up
we're about to delete this entity and
unfortunately there's some kind of
memory corruption happening because um
in this particular area it's supposed to
stream out what uh I put some debug code
in here to see what's actually getting
deleted and unfortunately the
information we're getting out of this is
just pure garbage um what's happening
after some intense fun debugging uh we
have two competing systems Racing for um
the event done listening we have this
thing called an item Port which is uh if
I have keys I could attach the item or I
should say these Keys onto the ship and
the ship could fly away and it has keys
or guns or whatever and we have this
thing called a physics controller so
when this Keys um goes onto the item
Port it will lose its physics but then
physicalize onto the ship basically the
physics become one with the ship so when
the ship gets hit we know which item
gets hit it's some clever
magic and unfortunately when they both
register for this event done um
depending on the order of which these
components were created the physics
controller may get it first or the item
Port controller gets it first and if the
itm port controller gets it first it
will actually uh detach these keys and
say all right you're done and the
physics controller will then get
informed that these Keys have been
detached so it should basically now own
its own physics um but if the physical
controller gets it first it will DET it
will think is detached and then it will
physicalize itself so now it has physics
on the ship and it has physics on itself
but
unfortunately um it only is aware of one
at a time so it gets rid of the one on
the ship but the ship still thinks it
has it and this is where the issue lies
so the now this thing has its own
physics and it still attached and when
the item Port gets the event it tells it
to detach and ref physicalize but the
ship still thinks it has the ownership
of the physics so it now tries to clean
up to rebuild it and since it's now
pointing to an old point in memory it
will touch and corrupt anything and that
was in that memory position and then
things just go Haywire you start
crashing in random
positions so the correct fix is actually
to get rid of um the events listener we
don't really need for the physics
controller to listen for these events
because we have the item Port system to
do it for us this was just an extra set
of precaution that we don't really need
in fact it's causing a lot of harm so
this is one of those simple cases where
um extra safety actually caused us harm
since we don't really need it so the fix
is actually just to gut out the um the
system so it doesn't listen for those
and instead it listens it gets told by
the ad and Port system so I'm going to
gut all the location where it registers
itself and then clean up the listener
set oh there we go goodbye
listeners
and there it
is there it is so as you can see if the
physics got it first it would pretend
that it was released even though it was
still attached it was just the safety
measure in case the item Port system was
um not reliable but item Port system is
reliable uh so we could just get this
old Cod path all right let's rebuild and
through the magic of editing we be done
now so we're back in the fun little
level Bob's twitching out so let's take
care of his misery and made ship go boom
excellent ah game design so we're now
going to
spawn uh that fun
constellation and let's see if we
crash where is it spawning there you are
where'd it go there you are he moved so
let's shoot this thing and before you
say the pistol is destroying every
single thing I may have a developer gun
that lets me destroy things oh that
looks awesome all when this thing goes
away that should be the vehicle it
shouldn't crash hey it didn't
crashh so um thanks to my little debug
you could see um when that event got
dispatched the radar the Su flow graph
and physics uh that's kythera all got
information that's not physics
controller just yeah labeled differently
so everything cleaned up heck we even
got the item Port stuff there so a
couple thing got item ports so now when
the item Port gets the message it will
detach the thing the physics controller
will learn about it and then it will
send it off and everyone goes off their
merry way no more memory corruption no
more crashes everyone's having a good
time now we can play without getting
disconnected from a crash woo hope you
guys enjoyed so we had a very exciting
bug uh you know when you're in
multiplayer and you shoot some random
thing when the entity goes away boom
crash now your game's gone and you have
to restart all over to play again not
too fun so took a quick look at it and
it was just an issue with the physics
control trying to do an extra step of
protection uh we had that in there
originally because our component system
wasn't as robust as when it was
originally imp implemented many many
many months ago but now we have a much
more robust system so the flow and
expectations of when things could happen
are more reliable so didn't need that
extra step of protection now we don't
have that memory corruption everything
now works as expected no more crashes
everyone's good to go hope you guys
enjoyed and remember praise be the lamp
