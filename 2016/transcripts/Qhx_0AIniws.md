oh hello hello how are you how you doing
I'm bad not bad not bad good who are you
so I'm Randy Vasquez I'm associate
producer here at cig who are you
producer I'm a producer you know who I
am I don't know who you are I'm the Bug
Smasher no one watches that
show I'm the Bug Smasher Mark aent
gameplay programmer and everyone watches
me it's true not even creepy a little
bit creepy Well we'd like we're here to
answer some questions first we'd like to
thank the subscri
for everything they've done to make this
possible for us to have you know this
show for 10 developers and I guess that
one show you just mentioned what was it
again I forgot already I don't remember
I don't have coffee anymore something
about smashing bugs Bug Smasher I think
sounds right
yeah so let's get started all right
let's start off with our first very own
question from bacon of War I do like
bacon bacon
all right bacon says have you ever had a
bug that fixing it turn cynical IE you
fixed a bug in the piece of code but
that caused this piece of code not to
work so you fix that bit of code only to
find that it broke the original piece of
code again so bugs turn cynical or C
cyclical
cylindrical okay with that yeah yes oh
yes bugs have turned cinical and
cynical this happened recently um for
2.4 we're having this uh persistence uh
Shenanigans where you can you know walk
up to your ship and you know if I have a
cup on the ship or a weapon I could
select it and remove it and add maybe a
pencil a gun or something and in order
to see that interaction we had to use
our interaction system which was all
developed for item system 2.0 not for
the original item system so we had to
basically start making the original item
system work um with this interaction
system which meant we had to install a
new network um component a new physics
component and finally the interaction
component and the interaction component
and network component were like all
right I'll work I got this cool physics
component was like nah nah nah I got
bugs for you so we when I finally got it
installed got it in QA started finding
some bugs we had a flood of bugs coming
cuz like all QA was like I mean like all
the stuff is now we you're falling
through things like the turrets were not
working you could put a poster on the
wall walk up to it slap it and it' fall
down to the ground you could there's
like a weapon um thing to restock ammo
and you could push it into the wall and
I was like oh no what did I
do so yes you you fix one and then a
bunch more come up cuz QA especially
Andrew he'll call you up have this
cynical laugh and go
I found something you're like oh God
it's even worse when he reopens it and
then like just lets you know he's like
by the way re not only does when he
opens it he Skypes you directly and to
give you that laugh it's
great so yeah fix them break them
happens all the time and then you just
go back and fix it luckily that's why we
have QA QA is awesome yes oh my God so
the next one is actually um it's
actually before my time but p one one
one one one did I miss a one I think
there's four more ones four more
ones um so he says I heard a neat story
that when the first physics stuff was
being built for Star citizens the
spaceship movement was bugged and the
guy in charge of this was trying to
figure out what the heck was going on
double cheing triple checking everything
to find out what was going on he talked
with Chris Roberts at some point and he
said oh yeah cry engine simulates
everything as if it's underwater now if
I probably got something wrong in the
story above but but I want to know if
there's any similar stories to share
about someone losing lots of sleep
trying to figure out a problem that
turned out to be incredibly easy to fix
if you just knew that particular audity
of the engine so I don't I didn't even
know about this story what is what is
this oh this is a great story so this
happened roughly two years ago before we
even launched uh Arena commander and we
had our physics programmer John pitet he
flew out from Kansas and we were working
with him trying to get you know R
Commander one out and everything was
going sort of working well and then all
of a sudden our ships just started
acting weird you you'd fly but it would
go the wrong way and then you would just
stop so like our missiles sometimes
worse actually our missiles were
underwater but that's another story um
but yeah uh and we're trying to figure
out what's going on and John pritchet
he's debugging debugging this I think he
spent like two or three days cuz we're
all still new at the engine especially
him trying to figure out what's going on
with physics the game code is the
thrusters it's whole big system yeah and
he finally figures it out he walks up to
us and he goes I still remember his face
our ships are
underwater everyone around just looks
and goes can you repeat
that our ships are
underwater and what happened is um cry
engine by default like if has water
under everything under every single
level in cry engine has water if you
think of an um like XYZ plane you have X
and then maybe Y and then Z up and down
so if this table was the XY and then Z
up and down anything below zero would be
considered water so any entity that went
past 0000 instantly got the water flag
so if you were flying up in here you'd
be fine soon as you go down here you're
in water even though the plane is
invisible cuz like you can't really even
though we got rid of terrain and got rid
of water for space you were still going
underwater nice and it was like a simple
fix it was just like really oh my
gosh and there's been many bugs like
that but H that's kind of awesome I can
see I can just see John's face to is
like by the way by the way this thing
water yes everything's in it yes cool I
I don't even know how you knew that but
that was a good that was a good
story all all right let's go on to our
next question yep so Mr mortise rigger
oh that's good we have I have to say
before I go on to this question we have
I'm gonna get we have a guy named John
and his last name is rigs so we call him
rigs the rigger yeah he doesn't like it
hopefully he doesn't see this but rigs
the
rigger so Mr mortise rigger um bug
smashing open development versus closed
development pros and cons go favorite
proon most hated con go so we actually
talked about this for a little bit in
that there's a big difference in the
team setup when you're live and
basically open development compared to
when you know you're behind closed doors
and the players don't get a chance to
see what you're actually working on cuz
like I remember when I was a designer
working for other Studios and when we
before we released any betas or Alphas
or anything like that like we were able
to just work on a feature and really
nail that feature down and we also had
like you know QA didn't really bug it up
because they knew it was being worked on
where now in like open development we're
always live and people get to see
everything we do every single push and
the features we push forward like QA is
again QA is awesome because they're like
they're basically our lastline defense
as well as they're on all the bugs on
live they're on the bugs on the features
so they're bugging everything and they
even talk with the community to find
what they have and going back and forth
all the information then drop it on our
desk going okay yeah so it's like it's
it's I think like open development to me
takes a little bit longer I think that's
the con but again we get really valuable
feedback really early on I know um what
port modification and the 2.4 stuff
we've been working with like the private
group we've been getting a lot of
feedback on some of the features that
we're trying to push out and stuff we
didn't even think about like oh yeah
yeah okay cool we didn't catch that cuz
I mean QA I think we have like maybe 30
people if that I don't even know the
actual number I think there's more cuz
UK and Austin have a lot yeah but it's
like I don't know like I think it might
be about like 30 something people and
that's not enough people like all the
stuff we need from there is like we need
more we need more people to test big so
that's good that's the definitely good
Pro for having open development and
everything like that where closed
development we don't have those same
numbers of people being able to jump in
and stuff like that and getting play
test sometimes getting everyone involved
is kind of crazy especially like trying
to get devs to like take time out of the
day to to play tests which we do do
from well that's why you go around going
ready to play test ready to play test
ready to play test you're like bit five
minutes five
minutes so yeah that's kind of the pro
and con I have for um open development
versus closed development I don't have a
preference sometimes I have a pre like
if I'm working on a feature I have a
preference you know but if I'm not
working on a feature and I'm like just
helping support stuff then I definitely
prefer one the other so
yeah anything on you good all right
let's go to the next one um next
question
from am I don't know how to say that
am hi Mark and Randy
hi I understand that Mark is both a
feature program and a Bug Smasher at cig
do you typically get signed to squash
your own bugs also bug smashing seems to
be largely entirely directed at coding
errors does cig have a similar system in
place to smash design bugs and then how
do you smash how do you smashing bug
code bugs and fix and design errors
compare so so this all kind of lumps
into big one thing like I know I'm
always talking with the engineers I'm
always talking with the designers and
stuff and design is kind of a weird
thing in that designers are kind of the
glue for a lot of different departments
and all the Departments here at cig like
they work closely like hand in hand like
how many times do you work with
designers at least like every day and
then also how many times do you work
with artists so every single department
is kind of use the word cyclical like
they all work together they're always
because you and Mark McCall are always
working on stuff together so the tech
content team the tech artist the regular
artists when they're making geometry if
the geometry is not working right with
the tech then you have to go back and
forth I know Ariel is working on the
port editor stuff yeah so like he's been
working with the artist big time over
the past like two three months he's been
working and then also working with the
designers as well because make sure when
they use the tools they can kind of go
from there so yeah it's
like I don't really think that it is a
specific system to like the whole entire
company but like every department has
their own processes in which they handle
the bug like um some of the stuff with
the ships I know you and Kirk talk a
bunch because Kirk's like hey what's
going on with this what's going on this
and like you and Sh were talking about I
think um some of the weapon stuff like
what last week or was the week before I
don't know remember well it's like um
with the new item 2.0 stuff like since
we're changing a lot of the systems I'll
go to design go hey this is how I'm
thinking of implementing it cuz they're
the guys that are actually going to do
the Brute Force work of here's the XML
here's the records stick it all together
I go here's the flow I'm thinking what
do you have an opinion on what do you
think and they'll give me a feedback and
then I'll go to Evil Mark or Mark mall
and all other marks are
evil even this one even this
one but I'll go also to evil mark
because he'll do the like um asset and
animations and Link those together with
the items so design has specific Area
Tech design has a specific area so I'll
go to each one to make sure that when
I'm making this new stuff that they both
work together yeah so yeah it's a big
mix like there's like I said like
everybody everybody has their own
process and what they need it really
depends on what the bug is and what they
need for it and who to talk to so cool
let's go to the next one all right
sounds good Mr Steve
Hunter hey guys thanks for all the hard
work you're
welcome we do hard work I thought we do
fun work I hav fun I think it's fun
sometimes all the time most of the time
uh when fixing bugs have you ever had an
occasion where it was fixed in one place
only discover later that the actual
cause was in some other place so you had
to do the proper fix and undo the
original fix yes
yes um I actually did a Bug Smasher
video yeah you know that
show never seen it I have to edicate you
after this actually I think I'm on one
or two of
them no that's t or something may I
don't
so um yes all the times so I guess the
example would be going back um with the
new item system um we have these
entities uh or items and they have I
love having this stuff maybe it has this
cup as what it looks like and it's
physics so if I hit the cup it you know
reacts and and it um is just one thing
that we have we designate a slot where
this geometry and physics go and we
could have a number of slots but for
most part uh we have one slot and our
old items had one slot but to get this
interaction system up and running we
need to have um physics in different
locations in you know maybe this one
opens a door this one turns on power so
we had to have another physics thing so
now we have two slots in this entity and
we had to physical
both and it should have been as simple
as
saying1 and what that would do is go if
it's negative 1 it'll go through each
slot and physicalize it that was
something we've did about two years ago
for the vehicle system however um it was
working when we attached this these
items to ships but then as soon as you
detached it and put it onto the ground
it had no physics and it was because of
that change and I were like what's going
on this used to work this worked two
years ago it's always kind of funny when
like bugs like that pop up because then
you guys are fighting old code and they
mean like whoa whoa whoa so we did we
want we want this to happen why is this
happening then like kind of dig it in
like sometimes I know you guys are like
one time I think you came came over
Destin was like you had like 12
different files open you're just like I
don't know where it is I'm just tracing
back the history but ultimately I did
find what was causing that and it was
when it hit when it was negative one
just early aborted while the code that
we had back then was just missing and I
literally was tracing back to history to
find what happened cuz I'm like this
code was there and I find it way back I
think it was a year ago there was an
integration from like a newer engine
engine version to some new tech for like
64-bit and during that it removed some
code and we just never noticed this
because we never had to do this type of
thing yeah um the vehicles ended up
getting a completely different code so
we never noticed it until we put this
item in and then so yeah I was like all
right here's the old code that used to
work and then now when we plop this
thing down the ground it has physics
it's just like the history is haunting
me it's like I fixed this ago don't envy
that at
all but luckily oh I love per force you
could just scroll through the history
and like where'd it go where it go there
it
is it's called the blame history yeah so
the next one actually for me
is um from Sloan Warrior when an
impending release rears its head roughly
how much of the company would you say is
devoted to getting the release out bug
Smash and testing and so on conversely
how much of the company isn't impacted
by the release cycle and simply
continues to make content this one right
here is kind of a mixed bag and can't
really answer it because this is a case
by case for instance this release um
we're working on you know persistence
we're working on shopping working on
item 2.0 here specifically and then
we're working on refact in little things
here and there and then the art time art
ah the art side they're actually working
on like the caterpillar and then like
you know Jeremiah and om they're all
working on like more character stuff
Shane was working on like a cool um
jetpack that's supposed to be going in
this release too so every single
person's working on tons of different
things ton of different aspects and
they're not necessarily all working on
the same thing but they're all working
towards the goal of the release and
every single release we have a goal we
like all right these are the main points
we want to put into this release and
then we kind of go from there and it
goes back to even the bug fixing it's
the same thing with task with task
fixing and task like you know management
of going through and making sure like
all right what support does this task
need and then kind of going from there
so I know you've actually been pulled
off sometimes from doing the feature
stuff cuz I know you're working on you
was working on seats controller manager
with some of our new Engineers we're
working on Signal links and stuff and
piping and making sure all that stuff
situated but then aent here gets like
pulled off and like oh okay well two4
needs help with this so I'm going to go
help out that so he will take a day or
so here and there and like Paul has been
a mad man like he's crazy out those yeah
dude he's been really helping out the
2.4 stuff and he's been focused on that
so that way like his team can continue
just focusing on the feature and but
he's a beast anyways like I mean he the
amount of stuff he knows about the
engine and amount of stuff that he just
knows globally is just insane like my
brain only fit so much you can talk to
him and say something he'll like give a
second the brain starts ticking and then
then he spits the answer on you're like
okay yeah so no it's basically
everything and that's every release it's
completely different so the stuff we
have planned for 25 and going forward
it's going to need different resources
so and this is going to be spread across
like you know all the different Studios
that we're working with whether it's
like you know Frankfurt UK Austin here
in La even the guys at turbulent stuff
like we're all just working on different
aspects of it and need different things
just from each release so every single
release has its own little snowlake and
to add on to that it's like I could be
working on you know the subset of stuff
for the new items things and then I
can't work on the next thing because I'm
waiting something from Patrick or even
Chad so I take my code and I put up for
a review and I go wait meantime I go bug
Paul saying hey I'm blocked by this is
there anything I can help with yeah and
then I'll just help with some two4 stuff
or some other things and then once I get
unblocked I'll swap back yeah and right
now I think like um actually
between you between Paul you and Chad Z
now like you guys are the old people
here for
engineers like you guys are V to the old
crew and like now we have a few we have
a few new engineers and stuff coming and
then hopefully when we get humph he'll
be actually kind of an old head too CU
he knows the engine really well he'll be
another senior here he's another Paul
yeah I know it's going to be crazy
having you three
together all right so hope we answered
your question um let's go on to the next
like rambling got to give the details
man uh did you say the question last
time I did okay you can say it no I got
this uh this one's by
overturn hi hi hi can you tell us more
about the tools you have developed
internally and are in use uh for
instance a tool to balance ship and
weapons if it doesn't exist yet are you
planning to do it and with what
approach oh so actually this is a good
one like we talked about John P before
with the the cool story and John's
actually been working on something
that's um like goal based tuning so that
way it helps the designers kind of input
information into like a database right
like a spreadsheet or something like all
right this is what we want the ship to
do and then the system will extrapolate
everything all the information and then
kind of make it work with ifcs and
everything like that and also kind of
help like the big ships the like the
Idris the javelin all those also kind of
work into it so like huge because um his
system is physically based so you need
to have actual proper physics um bunch
of prams and designer they're like what
does this one do basically and it's like
John has it all in his head I know it's
scary and he has all these valuables
that he knows of and it's just like I
just wanted to do this thing so he's
he's making a nice in-game tool to say
give me what you want output those
values I remember sitting I remember
sitting down with John and I was like
John explained this to me he was like
okay so he explained it to me and I'm
just
like jaw dropped eyes glassed over and
then he was like too much
mhm um no he's I love talking to him
he's funny I'm like oh my God all this
stuff that you're putting into this is
crazy so um he's actually been he's been
in UK for the past week or two actually
this is the second week he's been in the
UK and he's been working on the gold
based gold based tuning system before
that to before he goes out there to
train like Andrew Nicholson on how to
basically tune it for balancing and
everything like that so it's it's been
good for him to have to be out there
just so he can sit down with the guys
and be like all right this CU tuning a
ship used to take a week or two
sometimes like depending on how
complicated things were and how
thrusters were working now they have it
down to a few hours so like it's a
really big noticeable difference of
balancing the ships now well that too
and it's like um it would hit different
problems and because we've done it so
many times John knows what problems
there gon to be so he's able to make
these tools to help designers fix it and
do it quickly so he's got down to a
science and yeah I know he's pretty good
about just sitting up the designers too
and like figuring out exactly what they
need I remember um on my the first ship
I was starting to work on and he was
like okay let's get this thing let's get
this thing fly ready I'm like okay and
he was talking about like all the math
and algorithms and trying to get the
thrusters set up and I was trying to do
the balance on the thrusters and I was
like oh my God so much stuff he has a
lot of helpful things that just show the
visual things yeah sometimes you just
want to take a straw and like like suck
the knowledge out and his stuff is more
I guess in engine debug screen stuff
that outputs things but we do have other
tools like um data Forge or even the
thing like aiel is working on data Forge
is a big help actually cuz it's going to
start really cleaning up from doing like
hand XML stuff and anyone does like hand
scripting and stuff like that it's like
H if you have a tool it makes it so much
easier to read and cleaner so that way
you can see where the issues are no more
editing Raw xmls it's so awesome when
that's get done yeah and we also have um
Aerials to the item Port editor yep
which helps tremendously because you
could see on the screen in game your
character and the ships and you can move
remove stuff and you could see it right
then and there and any errors like hey
this can't fit there because the size is
wrong well he just recently got the
preview stuff set up too this past week
or so so it's like really good like I
know Sean Tracy and like Mark McCall and
um the new guy link he's actually going
to be working on with that tool and
stuff so they've been giving a lot of
feedback and he's been working side by
side with them and all the tools are
just like I said like tools are awesome
yes people that can generate tools to be
useful and stuff will just save time so
we can develop more faster better mo
better and if we don't have tools you
could always just be KX and just write
your own python goey system to do heat
balance and yes he did do that he did he
did he he was like Hey look I'm
prototyping
this okay okay at least he's not flow
graphing it
he did I know but it was like flowra he
flow graphed the entire system and then
once he figured out how he wanted it
then he made the gooey so he could
explain it to better to other people
yeah cuz like the flow graph looked like
spaghetti half the time yeah I don't I
remember actually I remember one time
when he had first done like the little
thing um for the when you're inside the
cockpit and you get to interact with
things and then he like he showed you
guys the flow graph and you and Paul
were like how does that work and he's
like I don't know just works he gets
prototypes working
great but they're
prototypes remember I tried getting his
grabby hand stuff working in one of my
levels when I was trying to mess with
like some of the cargo and some of the
Salvage and yeah no I was like kex I
don't understand this it's like yeah
that ain't going to work it's prototype
mhm all right so next question is by
Rufus Ultra hey Randy
hello how was your transmission from
from Dev to producer do you like your
new job do you miss tinkering with the
caterpillar or do you enjoy running
around with a stick and Pock Mark and
other devs while demanding progress ooh
so my transitions my transmission's fine
did you get your have you gotten your
checked out
lately what I power walk I power walk
every day 30 miles 30 miles yeah that's
why you have like 30 30 miles down I do
you think I'm still up nice now the
transition between Dev to producer has
it's still ongoing I think I've been a
producer now for 3 months maybe actually
no four months feels like forever feel
like
years thanks have that dread when you
walk over that's right like get to work
I'm like no no keep oh no there a and
then you'll be like what there is a jira
sir yeah
jira you had to do that didn't you he
does this all the time he'll be like hey
there's this bug ask you do I'm like
there's no J I can't do it and he'll be
like
Jara I'll be like you fine and no no
then I'll try to get out of and go does
my lead know and you'll be like Paul and
then Paul's like I'm like fine I'll do
it yeah I know cuz like um there's
always a problem in development right
where like people will since I come from
a Dev background and I'm transitioning
over to to production it's kind of like
that whole thing of like devs will be
like I'm not doing anything to producers
says unless they have a jira I'm like
okay fine it's document and I'm like
yeah I know these tricks I've done them
myself it's like kind of like um against
us you're a
spy pretty open spy then your tactics of
spying needs a little
work so yeah no it's like the transition
is still going um I really do enjoy it I
mean of course there's some things like
I hate scheduling oh my God I hate
scheduling so much cuz it's such in this
type of like to schedule for it's it's
an asynchronous schedule because you
guys are working on something completely
different the designers are working on
something completely different all the
games that I've worked on before have
all been regular MMOs or more standard
MMOs to where you know you have a Zone
and then you have all the quest that
you're planning you have everything else
you have that progression and you we
knew exactly what that progression was
from Level zero all the way to whatever
level cap was so it was easier for us to
look at it and I've always kind of done
production work in my other roles too
cuz I've always always been like a
designer SL producer on some things I've
always made my own Jas and stuff I
always had my own features that I was in
charge of so I've always run that and
when I was like when I was at 38 I think
I had a team of nine people and I was
the scrum Master for the team and I was
running the features I had I was in
charge of the quest tool which anybody
that knows about anything tools like the
quest tool itself like touches
everything in the entire game because
everything is based on that then I had
like localization stuff I had some
dialogue stuff so yeah I've always kind
of done production stuff I've just never
never actually made it really official
yeah so it's kind of it's different a
different mentality I'm still trying to
like I still have that inner battle
right now of like Dev versus producer
but it's also cool because I can go into
meetings with you guys and like one of
The Producers when we were talking about
the door the doors meeting right we're
talking all through the logic and
everything like that and I'm like I
understand it because I've done this
before and I've been a Dev for a while
but the other producer he's like I I'm
lost and we're like we're just talking
about doors he's like oh I think Sean
walks up and he like just made a door
yeah I know right but even still like I
was able to talk logic and I'm able to
like give input and stuff and help
facilitate that so I kind of have an
idea of kind of what the developing team
needs Grant out of still working on that
too CU they're always hitting me up hey
I want to do this I want to do this okay
like the other day you I saw you like
I'm on a meeting and I see like aent
just like pulling a um a whiteboard I'm
like I'm like hold on what what are you
doing I needed to schedule things
so then we started working on that
together and kind of like putting the
task up there and then making sure that
at least the people he needs to work
with which right now you're working with
Patrick a lot so make sure that they're
always in sync and they have what
information who's doing what task since
they don't necessarily have the same Vis
um like visibility that I do well we'll
have like the highend Jas that you'll
sign us like hey make the seat but there
may be a bunch of things under that
where I'll have to work with Patrick and
go all right we have to plan this out of
how we're going to do this do we need
any resources like Kirk I needed some
stuff him to do so we get the new item
stuff working it's like all right that's
another task that's the task that's the
task it's just like actually to be clear
so a producer is never development boss
like their job is to facilitate and get
like to help them out to make sure that
they are not blocked so they can do
their job cuz like um some people they
have the that they're outside the game
industry they have the notion of like oh
well producers the boss I'm like no
producers never the boss like every time
I make task it's based on discussions
with like Paul and you and the rest of
the team and being like okay I'll set up
the meeting and I'll be like all right
guys this is the goal that we want to do
what are the task what do we need to do
and then you Paul are almost like okay
well to do that we need this we need
this we need this and then I start
taking the notes and I start jotting
down all that stuff and then I turn
those notes into actionable items so
that way you guys can you know do the
work but you guys already have a better
idea of exactly what it takes to do that
work I just trying to make sure that
that work is visible to now a larger
audience so that way people can
understand what you guys are actually
working on and doing and to track it
what are they doing mostly communication
tracking I have no
idea stuff we're doing stuff and things
MH we're making stuff work with more
stuff you keep breaking
stuff you have to break it to make it
nice nice
I see The disapproving Look by Hennessy
over there you saw that he was like ah
me and QA are buddy
buddy speed dial pretty much dial with
them
now all right next question all right
from Mr far Seeker why not near Seeker
why you got be far it's so far so
far question for Randy oh I'm gonna read
your question hello I'm
delegating big
turn for patches with the type type yes
there's two types I have to say the type
for patches with the type of fundamental
change is expected in two4 does the live
team do anything special in preparation
or is it hand off from PTU and QA
basically the same so this right here
like as mentioned before every
single every single release I know right
we don't know we're being held by
gunpoint what a Nerf really are those
things those things shoot fast to they
do all right I'm getting put off on a
tangent you're like that's our stay on
tangent
machine so every single release um
there's really no live team there's
basically everyone and then what is
based on the lot the release they kind
of pull from resources and like like I
said before like art design engineering
everything they're kind of like all
right well this is what we want to do
this is the goal for this release and
then we pull the people that are in
charge of those features is in charge of
that release so then they'll kind of do
most of the work for each individual
release and when we do handoffs we do a
handoff every day mhm and the handoff
happens between the UK and here in the
US and UK takes care of the stuff in
Frankfurt as well so they'll have all
those mix of bugs and then Alex Marshal
and all of them over there they'll go
ahead and kind of communicate with all
the producers over there so that way
like there's main points of contact for
each individual studio and then we'll
have meetings every day and now if we're
pushing out to live or if we're pushing
out to the PTU and stuff then we'll even
have more meetings because we'll have
our no go or like go no-o meetings and
we'll be like we'll talk with QA we'll
talk with the main leads and being like
all right is this good enough to go to
PTU now sometimes it was been completely
like crap but we needed to test some
stuff we're like hey we just put this
fix in or we just put some debugging in
and then we're like but we need to push
this to PTU now so then like you know
we'll ask for a build QA will do like a
dirty test of that build and then we'll
push it out to PTU anyways just so the
people that are on PTU they help us out
and they go through and get everything
situated so we can keep testing it's
like I know this is going to break this
but we really need to test that yep yep
so sometimes we've even like disabled
Arena commanders like for two4 stuff
we're testing on like the PTU right now
um we we don't have Arena Commander
working because Crusader at the it's
only Crusader because we want to really
test the shopping we want to test that
stuff and there's enough crashes and
breaks without introducing more things
in there
so yeah no we definitely do a handoff
and it's every day and it's the
communication between the different
departments and QA and QA is really lead
in charge of like telling us what's
broken and what's not so I'm going to
get shot I'm done I'm waiting I'm just
waiting he's waiting for us to get
comfortable and then he'll shoot one
we'll be like what I'm do my
girly oh that's not cool pluck uh oh
jeez where did he get you at
I don't want to
say right in my
soul oh no all right next
question in my squiggly
spooch it got me right where it hurts oh
now you want us St continue
yes all righty so the next question um
is byon Jimmy beard
oh oh bage 44 my page isn't the same
thing he has bej BJ bej bj44 Jimmy beard
so after each patch launched to the PTU
do our bug reports make a difference yes
I report bugs but have never received
message or email stating it was resolved
or fixed does this happen thanks so much
for all your hard work jimy beard out so
again yes every time you guys put in bug
reports or using the council anything
anything you guys do using the forums
Community is always going through that
QA is always pouring through that
Design's pouring through that a bunch of
people are always pouring through all
the community stuff on the forums
Council like bug reports everything all
the crash reports I know once the
crashes get to a certain point then all
those crash reports are sent out to the
producers then we send them out to our
Engineers so that way they can kind of
look at the crashes get everything
situated so yes everything you guys do
seriously thank you yes because without
you guys testing and helping us actually
find this stuff we could not do our job
and fix what is needed I there could be
bugs sometimes but we just can't even
replicate it we need more information
and when it goes out it's like maybe a
ton of you guys get it and you pour all
the information of how you're getting
this thing and then all the information
gets compiled up sent into a gigantic
jira and that says this guy and it will
link to what you guys have said and it's
just like a big document of like
everything so we could try to scramble
through what is actually happening what
is what people might think was happening
yep and we've found and tracked down
lots of bugs and QA QA is the one that
gets those reports and then once QA gets
those reports then they go ahead and
verify it they fill out the information
for like extra steps alternate ways to
get things alternate ways because um
like one of the ones actually recently
remember the spawning the spawning issue
we had where like 50 something Pirates
were just spawning and we could not
Repro that at all but then people on PTU
they're like hey this is happening so it
took us like about good 3 to 5 days to
finally like narrow that down and that's
between design and
Engineering um there in QA like those
guys were really just hammering these
different aspects so yes seriously thank
you again for all you guys hard work
helping us make like Star Citizen better
by testing jumping in the PTU jumping on
live using the report system using the
forums reaching out to us it is really
really appreciated on everything that
you guys do with this community and even
if you don't get a reply we're still
more than likely using your information
it's just our QA team is so small and
they're stretched so wide they they
don't have really enough time to you
know reply to everyone so they'll just
gather the information that they can get
the report done so the developer could
get it and then if they have time then
they'll reply if they have I yeah I
don't know it's it's really hard for
them but we do use a lot of information
on I've seen information from Reddit
from the forms anywhere I've even seen
post on Facebook actually YouTube is
actually really funny too cuz like we
saw so many good things on YouTube but
again um so so for you guys thank you
for letting for allowing us to do this
this is subcribers yes awesome

get to be very open with you guys answer
questions you know and take the time out
of our day to kind of again thank you
guys cuz this is pretty awesome that we
get a chance to do this not you guys we
wouldn't have bug Smashers or whatever
