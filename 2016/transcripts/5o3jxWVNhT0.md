Hey everyone, welcome to Bug Smashers.
I'm your host, Mark Abent. If you guys
have never seen this before, it's pretty
cool. I take you behind the scenes of
both Star Citizen and Squadron 42 on how
we develop and basically destroy these
bugs. Uh you know, when we're developing
things, things go haywire all the time,
and I'm here to show you some bugs I get
smashed. Yeah, let's smash some bugs.
Bug Smashers!
Hey everyone, we are here in my fancy
dance test level.
Um if you haven't seen this before,
I like to play around and have a bunch
of things in my level so I can test all
sorts of things. And in this particular
particular case,
I broke grenades in multiplayer. So,
hop on top of the ship, and if I try to
throw a grenade,
it kind of just falls down, and then it
does an explosion. Oh god, I'm going to
die.
Woo, I got away.
So,
the grenade should, when you throw them,
you know, travel a some distance, not a
football length, but you know, some
distance. Oh, I fell.
Unfortunately, when you throw a grenade,
they just plop to the ground, and they
just stay there, and then you they
explode, and everyone around dies. So,
what's happening? Well, an unfortunate
case of serialization.
So,
um we've been moving a lot of stuff to
these component device things where um
instead of jamming all this logic into
one block, we separate all this logic
into different blocks, and then we could
take some of this logic this logic,
stick it onto this item, stick it onto
this item, and the designers could go
crazy building these building blocks. Uh
designers get these Lego sets. It's
pretty cool. And one of these Lego sets
is this thing called a physics
controller. Uh the idea of this is it
handles all the properties uh that a
designer would need to do uh to set
physics on an object. And these grenades
are a type of physical thing called a
rigid body.
And how, when you throw this grenade,
it's supposed to basically serialize all
the information, the position, velocity,
and all that fun over to all the other
clients.
So, the server will see it far away, and
the client will get the network packet,
and he will also see it far going far,
far away.
But unfortunately, that broke. Um what
happened was
um earlier, we were getting some
disconnects on
Woo, this guy.
The ship. Um whenever the ship got
destroyed, it exploded and disconnected
everybody.
So, what I
ended up doing was Woo, where did it go?
Ah, there you are.
Um we have this thing called a game
object where it's like kind of the root
legacy component system before we
started doing our stuff. We're trying to
get rid of it, but we're still stuck
with it.
And anytime physics or anything that uh
syncs, it goes through basically this
block.
Um so, I added this little bit of code
right here that tries to serialize
um the state of the physics and handle
it for items, vehicles, and all these
things that use this physics controller.
Because prior to this, they were all
doing it individually. It was a whole
nightmare mess. So, I put it in one spot
so that all of them
could share the same bit of logic. But
unfortunately, it never actually got in
here for items because, due to legacy
reasons,
items have this thing called a capture
profile manager.
And in here, we have a profile manager,
it doesn't run.
Uh this profile manager, ideally, is if
we change physics, we could change what
stuff we serialize.
Uh so, if we have a rigid body, we could
serialize position, velocity, all that
jazz. If we have something that's
static, we just need a position.
But the network needs a constant flow of
information. So, if we're a rigid body,
we have to always serialize that
position and velocity. If we miss
velocity, we'll get disconnected. If
we're static, we always have to do
veloc- uh position. If we do any more or
any less, we get disconnected. Um so,
the profiles is kind of a way to say,
"Hey, now we're in this state, and now
we're in this state." So, we could
serialize the right information.
And the server was setting up the rigid
body,
uh so, it's sending position and
velocity, but the client wasn't
expecting anything.
So, when the client got the packet, it
was like, "What the heck? I don't know
what to do. You get disconnected."
So, with that fun jazz,
I was hoping to solve it with this.
However, I didn't take into account this
silly profile manager.
So, the fun fix is to actually strip out
that fun block and put it
before
um because we don't want this code to
run anyway if we have a physics
controller, whether or not we have that
profile manager. We always want to
serialize it
into here.
Because this old way would disconnect
you if you weren't the right type, while
this guy will serialize it
if you're in the incorrect type or not.
So, if we do send the rigid body, but
we're still stuck in um some other type
of physics, it will actually
uh handle the information by doing this
thing called a garbage snapshot where it
even though we're in this state and we
expect just position, it will also just
read in that velocity or position just
to say, "All right, we're not in sync
yet, but we will be soon."
And so, this guy handles all that.
So, we make sure the game rules or I'm
sorry, the game object goes through this
path, so everything will be fine and
dandy.
Uh the next thing we have to do is get
rid of this capture profile manager on
the item itself and the vehicle, and I
already did that for you.
And move it into uh the physics
controller, so he takes care of all of
the profiles.
All right. So, unfortunately, we have to
restart the whole game. All right. So,
the magic of recoding and editing has
finished. Uh we're now in back into my
test level, and we're going to go kill
Bob here with my grenade.
So, I'm going to stand back here,
throw my grenade at him.
Oh, there he go. Oh, I missed him.
Let's try again.
No! I hit my hand. I'm going to die.
Ah.
Uh things never work out as you want
them in game development, but as you can
see, when I throw grenades, they
actually move now, even if they hit my
hand. Uh
good times.
All right. Hope you guys like that bug.
Uh the wonders of game design. You know,
I try to fix one thing where if you're
in a ship and you get disconnected, I'm
like, "Ah, here's a good solution." And
then I get an email saying I broke
grenades. Uh good times. You know, we're
still dealing with these legacy systems
as we bring on our new systems, and it's
just a constant battle to make the two
in balance until we're finally able to
say, "Hey, old system, go away. New
system, take over control." Uh so, fun
little thing with the net serialize, uh
everything got sorted. Our vehicles now
serialize correctly, our grenades now
serialize correctly. No one gets
disconnected, and I can throw grenades
at Bob, and he explodes in the
glory.
Uh good times. Well, hope you guys
enjoyed. Uh this was Bug Smashers. I'm
Mark Abent at
gameplay programmer here at Cloud
Imperium Games in good old Los Angeles.
Hope you guys enjoyed. Until next time.
