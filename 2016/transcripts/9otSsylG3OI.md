Elwin Bachiller (EB): Greetings fellow citizens.
Welcome to the next episode of 10 for the
Developers, I’m Elwin Bachiller Junior,
Lead Vehicle Artist in LA and I’m here with...
Patrick Salerno (PS): Associate Technical
Artist Patrick Salerno.
EB: And we’d like to thank all of the subscribers
for making this show happen.
Without you guys we wouldn’t be able to
put this operation together and you guys really
help us develop the game.
So patrick, I have a question for you.
PS: Yes
EB: It’s from EarthFyre.
[0:54] EarthFyre asks: What aspects of the
development process do you enjoy, or perhaps
find difficult but rewarding?
PS: What aspects in particular?
Well, I like the challenge mainly.
You come in everyday, and it’s a different
type of puzzle to solve.
You constantly learn new things, and there’s
new tasks.
I need to be specific.
Lately I’ve been learning how to put ships
together and then tear them apart again and
that’s cool to me.
You go in, you see the model, you see how
it’s put together; you yank out the pieces,
put them in the xml and then you go in the
engine and you shoot it.
Then it blows apart, and there’s explosions
everywhere.
EB: Yeah your favorite part is breaking all
of the hard work that me and my team do.
PS: Yeah, basically.
EB: Yeah, that’s great.
Well for me the most rewarding part for me
is just when the whole thing comes together
and you finally get to climb into your ship,
turn everything on and take off and fly.
Ultimately, I mean obviously I enjoy doing
all the artwork for it and the struggles you
have to go through to make that happen, but
when you actually get to play the asset and
everything works the way it’s supposed to,
that’s the most gratifying moment for me;
cause ultimately I want an awesome game.
[1:56] Coldgas asks: What have you been working
on the past few days?
Any details you can tell us about?
EB: Yeah very easily.
The last couple of days I’ve been very specifically
been working on the beginning development
stages of the Caterpillar.
That means doing some whitebox work, that
means taking some concept work and bashing
it in to make sure it all conforms with the
gameplay.
It also means starting to do some work and
research on how materials work.
So specifically we’re putting a lot of effort
into developing how the paint wears on the
metal in the Drake ships because they have
a very different style than Aegis for example.
So that’s what I’ve been up to.
PS: Ok.
For me in particular transitioning from optimisation
to helping create these, they’re called
ship set up levels and it’s where you bring
all the pieces together.
In terms of optimisation i’ve been finishing
up just the level of detail pass on all of
the flyable ships in the game to get a little
bit more performance out of them.
Did a segment recently on that, goes into
more detail.
But, yeah!
Putting all the pieces together, trying to
make the work flow and the pipeline a bit
easier for other artists.
Just go in, check out the ship, shoot it,
look at it in different lighting conditions,
look at all the lights etc, etc.
EB: Cool.
[3:18] Belzoth asks: Can you define what a
successful ship is to you?
PS: To me in particular, well, to me a successful
ship is one that has made it through the entire
pipeline in an efficient manner.
What that means, in particular, is going through
all of the different phases of development
, from concept to actual modeling, texturing,
lighting, the whole destruction system, and
just making it into the engine, and performing
optimally.
To me, that’s a successful ship.
That means that it went through, you know,
who knows how many hands and then ended up,
you know, boom, in-game going, ready to go.
You don’t have to go back and fix things
that you’ve broken.
That’s a successful ship to me.
EB: Right, I mean I can agree with that, to
some degree.
I know you are really focused on the development
part of it, but I think to me, a successful
ship really is a ship that when I first show
it to someone, they’re like holy -, I wanna
fly that thing right now.
That’s basically a successful ship.
And I hope we can develop a lot of those.
PS: Definitely.
[4:20] Daz asks: When optimizing, are you
aiming for specific number of assets/triangles
on screen at any given time?
With backers keen in getting into some big
space battles how do you determine what is
possible and what ship count to set?
Given that it is possible for citizens to
pack a bunch of ships into a small area close
to each other causing a huge amount of detail
to be visible at close range, how do you manage
this?
PS: It’s kind of large question.
There’s a lot of variables that come into
it but really … really every ship is a bit
different.
Every ship is its own puzzle you need to solve.
And your general goal is to get them down
to roughly the same level.
So what I mean by that is at least just in
terms of level of detail, when the model slowly
disappears we’ll focus on that.
That’s really important.
That saves a lot of performance.
When you are up close to someone, you see
the ship: it has all of its internal stuff,
all of its external stuff.
All that full detail stuff, right?
But when you are far away, you may not realise
by you are not rendering all that stuff.
Like things get culled: the interior might
disappear, the model might degrade in quality
a bit.
Not noticeable.
That’s where it comes down to.
Things like that are where we come in and
we look at the statistics and we say “How
is this performing?
How many ships can we have in an area?
How much detail can we get at various ranges?”
And then we just optimise from there.
I mean for a specific number?
Really there’s not specific number of assets
or … it’s just like, you know, whatever
people’s computers can really handle based
on what we use to work with.
EB: Yeah.
I mean the beauty of having this game run
on a PC is that the more power you have, the
more of the beautiful visuals you can have
rendering at the same time.
PS: Yes.
EB: So part of it is hardware related, but
obviously we’re trying to optimise as much
as possible to make the game run as smooth
as possible for as many people as possible.
PS: Yes.
Exactly.
[6:16] Farasalt asks: Has there been a particular
time when you have had to make a decision
to not implement the most 'realistic' version
of a part due to technical/design limitations
and if yes, why?
EB: Interesting, so I spent a lot of time
working on the Merlin and I made that thing
so that you’d be able to open up every single
compartment to access, every single component,
but for technical reasons I had to rip all
that stuff out at the last minute and cap
the holes to get the ship to run because it
was pulling way too many draw calls.
So that’s one example of many that we’ve
had in the game, but the process of developing
a game often tends to be trying to go as far
as you can with a specific type of idea and
developing it as far as you can and realizing,
“Oh man, this isn’t going to work, so
how do we solve this problem with less resources?”.
So that’s just kind of a theme for game
development in general and that’s what happened
with the Merlin.
It made me sad because it looked really awesome
when you pushed the play button and everything
popped open.
PS: I saw it, it was so cool.
EB: Yeah it was very cool.
Maybe we can get that back into the game at
some point in the future, but at the moment
that was one example of what we had to tear
out.
[7:37] Amontillado asks: How closely does
LOD work tie into manufacturer style guides?
Does knowing what makes a MISC ship a MISC
ship help you create LODs for say the Freelancer
and Starfarer more quickly or does it make
little difference?
PS: Well actually not really much at all.
The concept for the ship and the main base
ship and everything that makes it up is based
on the Manufacturer Style Guides.
LODs are based on the actual geometry for
the ship itself and the best way to optimise
that down to a level where we can include
it with all the other ships and maintain high
performance.
So LODs aren’t really based on style guides.
You might, you might try, you obviously want
to keep the silhouette of the ship and keep
it looking like, you don’t want it to just
look blocky.
So if this ship has these nice curves along
the edges you don’t want the LODs to just
block them out or chop them up, you want them
to maintain that shape.
EB: Right.
I mean what that does mean though for LODs
there are some ship styles that are more difficult
to deal with, because of that.
So a very blocky ship, generally speaking
a very blocky ship, would be easier to LOD
because you wouldn’t notice the changes
in the surfaces as much as you would as a
ship that’s a little bit more rounded, so
yeah.
Style Guides don’t affect it, but the Style
Guide does, indirectly affect, how hard it
is to make the LOD for it.
PS: Correct.
[8:55] Wolf_Frakken asks: It was mentioned
on INN by Lando recently that the Caterpillar
will be somewhat of a benchmark for Drake
ships as far as design and looks go.
From your perspective, could you expand on
that more and how it will affect the Buccaneer,
Dragonfly, Herald and Cutlass?
How could you see the designs changing based
on what you've done with the Caterpillar?
I know it is hard to live up to everyone's
expectations, but without teasing too much,
how excited should we be about what is coming
to the rest of the Drake line?
EB: You should be very excited for what’s
coming for the rest of the Drake line!
And it is incredibly hard to live up to any
expectations for the quality bar for these
ships!
But it is true that the Caterpillar is going
to be sort of the first, I guess the flagship,
ship for Drake.
I know we have the Cutlass already out there,
and that was one was developed with techniques
that we’ve improved on since they were created.
So we will have to go back and sort of upgrade
those to the quality of the new ships.
So we’re trying to hit the bar of essentially
what the Retaliator is.
So the Retaliator has the latest and greatest
technology built into it and I think the Gladius
does as well and the Gladiator might have
most of that in there.
So we have a lot of ships that are already
starting to set an example for the kind of
quality bar that we want to go for, and also
the techniques that we’re using for various
reasons.
Damage, variety.
Making sure that we keep our texture resolution
high enough requires us to build our ships
in a certain specific way.
So ships like the Cutlass were not developed
that way.
PS: Correct
EB: And so it will have to get an upgrade.
Now the Caterpillar is sort of the shp that
we are pushing for to define the look of what
Drake is.
So when we’re done with that one we will
end up having to reuse some of the textures
that we developed for it, some of the shape
language, maybe even some assets.
Whatever makes it easier for us to develop
the future ships.
Then apply that to the Cutlass, do the same
thing with the Herald, do the same thing with
the Dragonfly, and the Buccaneer.
Ok I wasn’t sure those names were public!
So you should expect that the lineup for Drake
will look a family of ships.
So if I look at a Dragonfly I should immediately
say “Hey that’s a Drake ship!”
For this and that and that reason.
So we’re definitely trying to unify the
looks with something we’ve been working
on.
All of the manufacturers you should be able
to see this now between the Starfarer and
the Freelancer.
The UK team did a really great job unifying
those two ships.
They look like they’re exactly from the
same family.
The Reliant also because it used a lot of
assets that were involved in the UK.
So we’re trying to do the same thing with
Drake and the Caterpillar is the first one
online.
PS: Yeah.
And then as Elwin was saying as we build more
ships based on our Style Guides you’ll see
a more cohesive look come together.
‘Cause the more pieces you have from things
you remade you end up getting a giant library
based on these pieces and design aesthetics.
So it’s easier for existing artists, new
artists to just come in pick up, go “Oh
that’s what that manufacturer looks like”.
Based on existing ships versus the hardest
part is coming up with it.
You’ve got all these different manufacturers
and each one needs to have a unique aesthetic
EB: Yeah, yeah, cool.
Next question
[12:18] Cavguy asks: One of the fascinating
things for me watching you guys build Star
Citizen is how you pull it together.
Can you talk through the changes to the ship
pipeline over the last year and how it's reduced
the time it takes to get a ship from concept
to flight?
Also, do you think there is room for improvement
(maybe we can get the Carrack sooner)?
PS: Yeah.
Definitely.
I think you might actually be a bit better
answering this question per se but from what
I’ve seen from the ship pipeline as a whole,
from Concept to Tech Design to Implementation,
we’ve definitely made progress.
Because we’re working more closely with
our other studios, we do a lot of the tech
and the design and help with the engineering.
And it’s all just coming together and you’re
seeing things, higher quality, more complicated
assets, coming out quicker.
Right?
Versus concepting it, building the tech, putting
the tech into practice, experimenting on it,
breaking it, fixing it, and rebuilding it.
Right?
The pipeline’s come together which means
assets are getting pushed out faster.
EB: Yeah.
Absolutely.
To speak specifically about what some of the
changes … what some of the changes have
been to the pipeline specifically in developing
the ships.
We’ve moved slightly away from a paradigm
where we had concept fully developed for a
ship before production started going in to
work for it.
So now what we’re doing is we’re spending
a lot of time upfront working with Game Design
to make sure that all of the mechanics that
the ship needs to comply with, or the space
that’s required for the player to walk around
in if it has an interior area, is all blocked
out ahead of time, and before we even give
that to the concept artist, to make sure that
when a concept artist does his work it all
fits with the game rules and we don’t have
to worry about having to too drastically changing
the concept that’s already been developed.
Changes will always happen but doing it this
way allows us to catch any problems really
early on before anybody spends weeks or months
of their lives developing an assets that then
has to be reworked in the future.
So for the Carrack specifically we have plans
to build that “soonish”.
That’s the best I can say about that.
But right now Anvil is one of the those manufacturers
that still needs to have its library filled
out.
So Aegis, for example, because of the Retaliator
and some of the other ships in their line,
they have quite a bit of content to draw from
to develop the newer ships a bit faster.
With Anvil we’re not quite at that point
yet and so when we get there we will be able
to hit our stride and be able to develop ships
faster.
What will most likely happen is the Carrack
will probably help develop that library for
us because it will be the first large, multi-crew
Anvil ship that we probably work on.
And so that’s how we’ll develop our assets
to then, in the future, be able to build ships
even quicker.
[15:21] Johan_26 asks: Two separate questions:
On the development side, are there many manufactured
hull pieces that are shared across the ships
of a single company?
Like hatch, thrusters, seats, doors, panels,
etc?
On the game side, visually speaking, how customizable
are the ships in general?
(like in a Need for Speed underground manner).
I know about the possibility to change the
seats but could we expect some more customizations
like an interior paint job, switching to fancier
escape pods/beds, changing the whole dashboard,
more powerful headlights, better kitchen,
etc.
EB: I think it’s a tentative yes to that
second part.
Just to hit on the whole manufacturer sharing
assets.
That absolutely a yes.
It’s almost, it’s absolutely necessary
that we do something like that in order to
develop the number of ships that we have to
make.
So what that means is that we will have escape
pods that are common to Aegis for example
and you should expect to see those escape
pods in other Aegis ships.
Docking collars, same thing.
You may even see chairs that are shared among
the same manufacturer.
Right now, you will notice that on the Freelancer,
you’ve got a specific type of chair which
also exists on the starfarer, which a very
close version of that also exists on the Reliant.
And there's a couple of reasons for doing
that.
One, it keeps the look and feel the same so
you can identify what manufacturer built your
ship.
Two, we can actually build a ship much faster.
Right, sharing of assets within manufacturers
is absolutely something we have to do.
In terms of customization, we are still working
on what the full range of customization is.
The most obvious and sort of start of the
customization process that we really want
to hit is allowing people to change the paint
jobs on their ships.
We’re exploring a couple different ways
of doing this.
We haven’t quite implemented a full working
version of it yet, but it’s something we
are building our current ships to support.
PS: Yup, no, definitely, just on Elwin’s
note, I mean part of the development process
is making something, trying out different
techniques for it, and find out whether it
works.
So we do a lot of R&D into different ways
to do it.
Some methods make the cut, some don’t.
We used to have a paint system that was...
it was a little harder to work with.
We had paints, we had it working, and it’s
just, it’s a juggle.
You say “does this help the pipeline?”,
“is there another way we can do this faster?”.
That constant iteration is kind of why we
like working here as well.
You can make changes to things, and find a
better way to do it.
You’re not just stuck somewhere, you know?
You might have to go back and change old stuff
occasionally, but in the grand scheme of things,
it’s gonna help the entire pipeline.
So, we’re making everything basically as
modular as possible within sensical terms.
So, should be able to go out and get other
parts.
So definitely, modularity is something we
already have and can expand upon.
We just have to make sure it’s a good use
of time management and et cetera, et cetera.
EB: Right, right, and just to touch on what
you mentioned of us previously having a paint
system.
That system was harder to work with.
But it also became…
it created a conflict with the way we wanted
to do damage, just because of the specific
implementation method and as a result of that,
we went in favor of the damage to find a different
way of doing the customization of the paints.
PS: ‘Cause the damage is so much cooler
EB: Well, yes it is.
PS: Bomb metal melting away and everything!
So instead of saving...
basically, the way it works is you have UV
maps, if anyone knows what those are, it’s
where the textures get painted onto and the
way the tech works is the damage shader kind
of, it works over the UV maps, but you also
needed the UV, the paints in the UV too.
So they were kind of sharing the same space,
right?
So we were like well, what do we pick?
Then we’re like “Well, the paints can
probably be done a more another way, and more
efficiently, and this is just the best way
for the damage system to work”.
That’s how, kind of how where opportunity
calls for it.
EB: That also, I mean, that also kind of touches
back in the “what features have we decided
not to implement”.
That is one of them.
Yeah, so we’re working on a much better
way of allowing customization which… the
goal is to let people not only change, you
know, at least several different colors on
their ship, but also attempt to allow them
to pick, decals for their wings, or whatever,
that way they have like a massive happy face
or whatever they want to put on it.
So we have some prototypes of that working
and I think it’s going to be really cool,
but more work has to go into it.
[19:59] Eschatos asks:
A) When you're designing for this, is the
final damage state of a ship intended to reflect
specific damage?
(For example, is the tail/cargo section being
destroyed because that's where it was hit?)
B)Is the intention that we'll be able to survive
something like that if we're not in the damaged
section of the ship and have a spacesuit on?
C) And thirdly, do you have to consider the
repair mechanic when designing damage states?
PS: Yes.
That is pretty much exactly how it works.
What we’re doing on the tech design side
and this is going to get more in depth as
we go too.
You hit a specific location damage can transfer
from that location to another location.
There’s probabilities.
So if you hit like a wing and there’s components
under there, like shield generators or something.
That can be damage and that creates a rippling
explosion that goes and blows up something
else.
So we’re trying to create a very dynamic
damage system.
So at a base level things break off, wings
snap off, tails snap off, body snaps in half,
three main parts well three or four is like
nose, neck, body, tail.
So when your ship is finally 100 percent destroyed
if your neck is destroyed you’re just boom!
You just kind of blow up.
But if your tail broke off you might still
you know airlock, thunk, and try and coast
back to base.
It depends on how it’s going.
If you have a critical series of events that
happen that might destroy your whole ship.
EB: Yeah.
I mean if you trigger catastrophic damage
it’s game over!
PS: Yeah it’s game over your whole ship’s
going to blow up.
So at the end yes there should be areas that
you can see, especially like in non 100 percent
destroyed state.
You should be able to see exactly where you
got hit during your fight.
But at the end when your ship is blown up
you know you got shot in the wing but it’s
listing, you didn’t get shot in the tail.
And then 100 percent is a complete model swap
into the husk chunks at the moment with an
overlay VFX that bursts out.
It’s all blended together so you can’t
really tell.
But unless you’re going back for repairs.
You don’t really need to see that one area
where you got shot in the wing.
It’s all about performance.
How can we keep realistic yet persistent damage?
EB: The next part of this question is: Is
the intention that we’ll be able to something
like that if we’re not in the damaged section
of the ship if we have a space suit on?
I think you kind of touched on that?
PS: I did kind of touch on that.
Yes it is in the design board.
Right now you just blow up and die.
Your spaceship’s blown up right?
As the damage and how it transfers get more
in depth we can end up just probably saying
“Airlock door closed you’re all safe”.
I don’t know honestly I don’t really have
100 percent specifics on that.
But I do know conceptually it’s possible
and it’s what we’re leaning towards ‘cause
that’s realistic right?
EB: Yeah.
I think that’s ultimately the goal.
Obviously game design is still working on
the specifics of how that functions.
Because as per the example the back of your
ship gets blown off and that’s where all
your power plants are, and you’re stuck
in the front but you’ve got no power does
that mean you’re basically stuck on a floating
husk?
So there’s more than just the realistic
aspect of the game, we have to worry about
what the implications for the gameplay are
as well.
Okay so the last part of Eschatos question
is and thirdly, do you have to consider the
repair mechanic when designing Damage States.
EB/PS: Yes
PS: Yes you do because you have to think of
what’s going to need to be repaired, what’s
going to be left behind even if the mechanic
isn’t full implemented, you should still
think how is the player going to repair this,
which of the player will see, what tools are
at his disposal.
It’s a big difference, just think conceptually,
okay this isn’t how it is or anything, but
if you have a spaceship and it just flies
into a hangar and a bunch of nanobots repair
it or something that’s one way where you
don’t have to be too interactive, but if
you’re a dude with a blowtorch and you’re
up there, the ship is a completely different
spot; you’re getting completely different
visual, all sorts of stuff is going on.
EB: Yeah.
That repair mechanic is still being fleshed
out.
PS: Right
EB: I think it’s going to be really cool.
It's a lot more dynamic than what we had before.
It’s important to keep in mind our damage
system is not what we started with.
So we use the term damage states, but it doesn’t
actually reflect what it is anymore
PS: Right
EB: Right, It’s a lot more organic than
that.
So previously we did have something called
damage states where you’d shoot the wing
and there would be four different version
of the wing and different states of damage.
PS: 25/50/70 and 100
EB: Exactly, that’s gone.
So the way we’re doing it now is we're actually
building the internal supports for that wing
and when we shoot the whole surface it will
blow a hole to through it to reveal the interior.
There’s no damage state, it’s just how
much damage has that part taken.
PS: Correct and the only damage state is the
really the 100 percent at this point.
Are you destroyed or not?
EB: Right
PS: And that’s when you get the detach command
and then boom the wing or tail goes flying
off, but until then, it’s mainly just the
shader doing the work and it’s hitting and
it’s rippling out and it’s tearing apart
and then it’s transparent and you can see
the metal ribbing of the inside of the ship
and then that shows a more visual version
of the wear.
So it’s less memory because you don’t
have four different models per separate part
of the ship anymore that just has to do damage.
EB: Right
PS: And it creates a better visual due to
the way the shader works.
EB: Yeah
PS: So I mean we’re working on the pipeline
all the time, optimizing the tech, coming
up with new tech, implementing that and so
far it’s looking really cool.
EB: Yeah it’s very awesome and it's also
a lot more satisfying to see the damage happen
where you shoot.
PS: Yes
EB: Whereas previously that wasn’t the case.
You could shoot the tip and the base of the
piece would start to break off.
