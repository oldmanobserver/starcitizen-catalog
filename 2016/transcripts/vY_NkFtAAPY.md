Chris Roberts (CR): Hi, thanks for joining
us for this week’s Around the Verse. I’m
your Host and Game Director, Chris Roberts
and with me is
Sandi Gardiner (SG): Sandi Gardiner, hi Chris.
CR: Hi Sandi.
SG: On today’s episode we’ll dive into
the latest Star Citizen developments coming
out of our Los Angeles studio and while ATV
mainly highlights content that’s coming
in future game patches, there’s plenty of
gameplay that needs your help testing available
right now.
CR: Yes so backers can download the 2.5 Alpha
and explore around Crusader in the PU, visit
Arc Corp, check out their ships in the hangars,
dogfight against Vanduul or fellow players
in Arena Commander or try a hand at racing
on one of the Murray Cup tracks.
SG: Yeah, lots to do and any bugs you find
or feedback you have please let us know on
the forums and the issue council. All of your
input is such a critical part of the process.
CR: Yes it absolutely is.It’s especially
critical as we get more and more new players
joining us every week looking at it, getting
fresh new eyes so we have new opinions. So
newer veterans, Star Citizen would not be
possible with out and we’d really like to
thank you.
SG: Yes we would, and the support of our generous
subscribers as well who help us to provide
these behind the scenes shows and tons of
other weekly content.
CR: Yeah definitely, a big thank you to everyone.
Alright, so let's get onto the rest of the
show, so let's go to Eric to learn what’s
happening with the L.A. studio.
Studio Update
Eric Kieron Davis (EKD): Hey everyone, I’m
Senior Producer Eric Kieron Davis with your
studio update. Here in Los Angeles, we not
only get the chance to work on elements for
the upcoming Persistent Universe releases
as well as Squadron 42, we also work on some
larger foundational systems that affect both
games - let’s start with engineering lead
Paul Reindell and team to talk about what
they are working on.
Paul Reindell (PR): The major things we’re
working on right now, obviously is the Item
System 2.0, finishing out, Mark is doing a
great job on finishing all the ships to get
ported over to the new system.
We currently working also on the room system
and the action system which is the whole system
where we place different module rooms, put
them together and you can define atmosphere,
and then something like “destroy or blow
off a door, the atmosphere goes out and the
player will die” and at the same time we
also building the whole interaction linkage
system which allows us to place different
objects in a level and a designer can just
draw a interaction link for something then
make a button here, and they make a power
plant here and now they can just draw an interaction
link, “press this button and a power plant
goes on now” which is a huge prerequirement
for getting all those dynamic missions working
in multiplayer since CryEngine flowgraph system
is just not working in multiplayer so we are
replacing that all but Chad doing a great
job working on that.
And that’s all the prerequirement for our
single player campaign but also for the whole
PU mission system.
Chad McKinney (CM): Hi, my name is Chad McKinney
and I’m a Gameplay Programmer here in the
Los Angeles studio, I’m going to be talking
about interaction linking and the room system.
So this level demonstrates the room system
and atmosphere containers - the room system
and atmosphere containers are used to create
boundaries for our space stations and ships
and places in the game where we want there
to be pressurization of different gas levels.
It’s something that we’ve to date faked
in the game with the airlocks and you know,
if you go into an airlock without a space
suit, you’ll die. The system in place that
does that isn’t very general and it doesn’t
allow for emergent gameplay. What we’re
working on now is a system that is a more
proper way to handle pressurization and depressurization
in the game and it’s still pretty early
days for this - as you can see this test level
just has some basic boxes and shapes that
define their room volumes and we have some
test assets in here just to play around with
it.
These spheres that are inside these volumes
represent the atmospheric composition so here
the blue spheres are oxygen and the red spheres
indicate that that room has been filled with
carbon dioxide.
The room system uses three main types of entities
- one is the atmosphere container which is
the thing that has the atmosphere composition
so for instance, if I come over here and look
at this debug output, I can see that the composition
in a particular room is 0.8 percent oxygen
and 0.12 carbon dioxide so if I walk into
space, I have nothing. There is no atmosphere
in here.
So the atmosphere container is a very important
part, the next is the room, the room indicates
the volume and the boundaries for the atmosphere
that is connected to it - later on this will
also be used to indicate security and power
connectivity but for now we’re just working
with atmosphere. So that’s atmosphere containers
and rooms and the third important type is
the room connectors - so here is the yellow
box around this door, this yellow box indicates
that there is a connection between this room
here and outer space.
Now, the room system uses these room connectors
to try to create pressure equalization between
different areas - well, between the two spaces
that the room connector connects. In this
instance, the room connector is connecting
a room to outer space so if I open this door,
the oxygen levels in the room are going to
drop. And if I walk into the room, we get
some debug output to see that the pressure
in the room is dropping rather quickly and
the pressure in the adjacent room is also
dropping although less quickly because it
has to traverse through the room connectors.
Now, having a system like this is really nice
because it allows for more emerging gameplay,
I could for instance close this door and close
this door off and keep the pressure- keep
the depressurization localized to a specific
space or I could reopen the door and allow
for the oxygen levels in the other room to
fill up this space so that the people on this
side of the space station don’t die.
As you can tell, the room system is still
pretty early days, we are- we just now hooked
it up to audio and we plan on hooking it up
to the player behaviour and visuals soon but
for now we’re still developing it and I
look forward to having this into Star Citizen
which I think is going to allow for some interesting
gameplay.
So by now, you guys have started to see the
new interaction system start to come into
2.5 as well as the new content that we’ve
been putting out for instance in the demos
at Gamescom and Citizencon - the new inner
thought system gives contextual information
for objects and items in the game that you’re
interacting with. One useful tool that we
use with those interactions are something
called interaction links - interaction links
allows the designers to create relationships
between items so that you can build up more
interesting behaviour from smaller and more
modular pieces.
As an example, here in this test level, I
have set up a door that is connected to a
laptop and a power cons- or a power generator
and in any given level you can have a door
that has certain interactions like open and
close but you probably don’t want the player
to directly interact with the door - for gameplay
reasons you might decide that it’s useful
to have the player actually interact with
something that’s next to it, in this instance
I have this laptop here. Laptop has a interaction
for an open and close which is defined in
DataForge. In DataForge we can assign certain
values, such as ‘Sendable’, ‘Linkable’
and ‘Locked by Links’ and this just means
that we can actually link this interaction
to something else - Linkable indicates that
it can be linked to by a different interaction;
Locked by Links means we’re going to share
the locking, which is the semantic locking
and unlocking interaction.
So here we’ve set up this laptop and in
the interaction links panel, we’ve created
a link which has its source output open connected
to the input door’s interaction of open
and the same thing with close.
This means that if I go into the game, instead
of going up to the door and enter, instead
of that you come up to this terminal and use
the open interaction which will open the door.
I can also use the close interaction and back
and forth and as I use these interactions,
you can see that the text, the contextual
information given to the player, actually
updates in real time and this happens because
of the semantic state sharing that is implicit
in the interaction links.
Now this doesn’t have to be with just something
that we just walked up to and interacted with
but anything that supports interaction links
- I’ve also set up a proximity sensor here
that will open the door and close the door
whenever I enter area here. When I walk in,
the door opens and if I walk out, the door
closes again. What is nice about this is it
allows us to have self contained behaviour
so in this case, proximity sensor which can
then be hooked up to something else to build
up a more complex behaviour which is walking
into an area with door opening but you hook
up the same proximity sensor to anything else
- for instance I could hook the same proximity
sensor into a trap that maybe opens a door
and sucks out somebody into space and they
would then die.
So yeah, that’s the basics of interaction
linking - you set up interactions in DataForge
and then create interaction links in the interaction
link panel and then just use them in the game.
So, that’s interaction linking and the room
system, still a work in progress, there is
a lot of work to be done with this stuff but
I look forward to working on it, continuing
going forward.
EKD: Interaction linking is some really exciting
tech because it will help us allow everything
from simple button action behaviour and also
more emergent behaviour for networks of interaction
links - so up next, here is an update on the
Drake Buccaneer being built here in Los Angeles.
Elwin Bachiller (EB): So the Buccaneer is
meant to be Drake’s answer to dealing with
fighters - so ships like the Hornet, and the
Gladius and the Sabre - it’s sort of in
that class of ships that's purpose built just
for combat with a bit of a pirate flair to
it. So it’s intention is to be super fast,
super maneuverable but very flimsy. So it
can’t really take that many hits so you
can see this reflected in Jim Martin’s concepts
- you’ll notice the ship has these gigantic
engines that emphasis speed.
Some of the changes that we are going to be
making when we move into the actual full production
of the ship is the wings - they have a very
particular shape that we’re going to make
them a little bit smaller, little bit sleeker
to emphasis speed even more and we’re also
going to be placing maneuvering thrusters
all around the main engines in order to give
it the movability that it needs to basically
outmaneuver a lot of the other heavy hitting
ships like the Hornet or the Super Hornet
which are essentially flying tanks but this
will be a little bit more maneuverable - it
just won’t be able to take the hits.
So, with the Buccaneer, you’re going to
want to get in, do your damage and avoid taking
any damage. From a design standpoint, we also
wanted the main gimballed weapon on the belly
of the ship to be usable at almost every stage
of flight. So this includes having the landing
gear deployed and in it’s current stage
in the concept, the landing gear is blocking
the firing arc of the gun on the bottom, so
we’re going to have to redesign the landing
gears entirely for a couple of reasons - one,
to give the gun the firing arc it requires
and two, for performance reasons, we actually
are trying really hard to make sure that all
the landing gear tucks into the ship so we
can call that out in the game so it’s not
eating up the resources the entire time in
flight.
Some of the other changes that we’ll be
making have to do with the cockpit - so you’ll
notice in the concept that we’ve got right
side entrance into the ship - we’re actually
flipping that over to the other side so it’ll
be standard with all the other fighters where
you enter on the left side and we’re also
going to be changing a little bit of the shape
of the nose to accommodate a fold-out ladder
so that players can actually climb in and
out without any problems.
Matt Sherman(MS): To give you guys an idea
of what really goes into setting up these
ships we’re also going to give you a quick
look at what’s going on with the Buccaneer
in it’s very early whitebox stages. So,
really just starting the big, you know, production
build out on this ship… artists are wrapping
up the Caterpillar, I’m being able to move
onto this now. I’ve been wrapping up work
on the Herald and so now working onto the
Buccaneer set up so a lot of this is still
going to be temp or placeholder stuff as we’re
piecing this ship together because, you know,
we have to find out what are it’s custom
animation needs or custom art needs or custom
tech design needs before all these pieces
can come together.
So what you’ll be seeing today has a few
oddities, the pilot it’s not using the actual
animation template that the final ship will
be using. You’ll be seeing some fun oddities
with the Herald animation, warping somebody
through glass...some of the maneuvering thrusters
and main thrusters are going to look a little
bit awkward on the ship but those are really
so we can take something that we have that
works and in this case the main engines on
the Herald. We can just change some of the
data bolt those onto the ship, get something
put together and get something flyable really
quick and start tuning and find out, ok is
this delivering on the goal set we want? Is
this delivering on the gameplay we want to
have.
Here we have the current whitebox on the Drake
Buccaneer so just to a few of the quick highlights,
we’ve got it size one and size three wing
mounts. We haven’t built out the missile
launchers yet, that’s going to be a little
bit further into the greybox phase. Some wonderfully
oversized temp engines on this thing at the
moment, you can see that really big back here.
A lot of this is just to get the ship up flying
as fast as possible. If you notice any of
these little dots littered around the ship,
these are its maneuvering thrusters, 24 total
maneuvering and then main and retro for 28
total thrusters on the ship.
So, let’s just go ahead and climb in. The
onboard animation for it right now is a bit
off, you’ll also sort of see the control
panels are a bit broken but...so some of the
other fun oddities of whitebox, the ladders
won’t retract just yet, giant mains so you
can see the fire shoot out the front of the
ship. Then just basic gameplay is what we
get in the whitebox so all the controls, you
can roll, you can pitch, speed up, slow down,
anything basic. Then we just started getting
the tuning set up from here.
So the whitebox is really just the basic functionality
check so we make sure it can start, it can
stop, all its axial control… so roll, pitch,
yaw and then from here we can really start
getting the actual game play balance. Make
sure that, you know, the thruster counts are
just right, that the load balance on it is
just right.
Daniel Kamentsky(DK): So one of the challenges
if you’re using a pre-existing animation
template is if you have to alter the flight
controls to match the animation template.
So the Buccaneer we’re going to be using
a centre joystick and a left throttle. So
in this scene we have the rough concept model
we got from the concept artist and what I
did is I kitbashed in some existing Drake
assets along with some other guiding rails,
so I can line up the animation. So you can
see he’s getting in, it’s still really
rough and there’s clipping and all the parts
aren’t animated yet but we’re really just
trying to get an idea whether or not this
animation is going to work with the ship.
EB: So the concept itself we’re working
really hard to make sure that we keep the
spirit of the ship and it’s current iteration
concepted out so it’s actually really common
that we make tweaks for our designs when we
move into production and the reason why that
happens is because the concept artist is focusing
on communicating a specific feel to the player.
So if it’s meant to be a quick maneuverable
ship, we want it to look quick and maneuverable.
If it’s meant to be a big cargo ship, you
want it to look big and clunky like it can’t
move.
What happens when we move into production
we end up having to implement some standards
for gameplay reasons, so this means, you know,
floors have to be a specific height, ladders
have to be a specific height in terms of the
rungs, the seats have to be a very specific
way to accommodate for our characters. That
means we have to make tweaks to the concept
to basically nudge it in the right direction
to get it to fit properly. The changes that
we make usually aren’t, you know, big sweeping
changes where we completely redesign the ship,
it’s just to make sure that it works properly
with our game systems.
So when this whole process is done you’ll
be able to get your hands on an awesome ship,
the Buccaneer which is really meant to be
the pirate’s answer to the military ships.
So we’re talking about going against the
Avengers, the Hornets, this is Drake’s answer
to that problem. You know, the pesky law getting
in your way.
EKD: I know I’m really looking forward to
adding the Drake fighter to my line up. Other
portions of the studio are digging deeper
into 2.6 bugs. The art and tech design teams
are delving into several different ships as
well as concepts, characters and animations
that I can’t really spoil yet but all you
will be seeing in the not too distant future.
In other news in LA we’re gearing up for
the next week’s livestream and we’ll have
some more information out to you soon. Well,
that wraps us up this week, thanks for watching
and we’ll see you again next time.
Back to the Studio
SG: Awesome update with item 2.0 being fleshed
out with the room system and interaction linking,
it really gives us a sense of how the designers
will be able to create interesting gameplay
and missions.
CR: Yeah absolutely, so it’s opening up
a ton of possibilities. Players will be able
to approach a scenario in multiple ways, they
can charge in guns blazing, turn off the power
to fight passed security, maybe they want
to forget all that or force open the lock…
the airlock and vent everyone inside. So I
really thinking the emerging game play that
we’re working on will be a hallmark of Star
Citizen. That’s exciting to see it all sort
of come together to create such a complex
system.
SG: It is and it seems like scanning will
also be a pretty big deal with players gathering
info on making tough decisions.
CR: Yeah right, while making rushed decisions
with imperfect info which can be a lot of
fun too. So imagine having a ship flying towards
a ship and not knowing if they’re friend
or foe or maybe your scanner points out that
a ship in the area has an uncomfortable amount
of guns so you decide to play it safe and
stay clear. Going to have a lot of nice complexity.
SG: Speaking of, let’s go to CIG’s very
own scan operator, Tyler Witkin who’s been
searching the web for the latest and greatest
from our amazing community.
Community Update w/ Tyler Witkin
Tyler Witkin (TW): Hey everyone. Tyler Witkin,
Community Manager in the Austin, Texas studios,
here to bring you this week's Community Update.
Just as a reminder there's only one day left
to enter the Esperia Prowler Art Competition,
so if you wanted to get your submission in
I would do it now. We're going to be announcing
the winners to that competition November 18th
at our anniversary live stream.
In other news we've been nominated for Most
Anticipated Game of 2017 in this year's Global
Game Awards. If you want to follow all the
progress on that you can head over to game-debate.com/awards
, and the voting ends November 25th.
And now it's time for this week's MVP. A huge
congratulations to RiceMaiden for his detailed
efforts in creating a full sized 3-D printed
P4SC Rifle straight out of the Star Citizen
Universe. Awesome stuff, and we're really
excited to see what you print next.
Lastly the week would not be complete without
Reverse the Verse, so make sure you tune in
live tomorrow at twitch.tv/CigCommunity where
we're going to talk about everything that
you saw on today's episode. Thanks again for
all of your support, and we'll see you in
the 'verse.
Back to Studio
Chris Roberts (CR): Every week it's great
to see what the community's been up to, so
four years in and they keep on surprising
us. So, it's one of my favorite segments of
our show every week.
Sandi Gardner (SG): Yes they do, and up next
our character art team walks us through all
the pipeline refinements and improvements
they've been working on to make sure that
we can not only produce some of the most amazing
characters around, but that the system is
flexible enough to populate whole solar systems.
Character Pipeline Then & Now
Forrest Stephan (FS): Hey I’m Forrest.
Josh Herman (JH): And I’m Josh.
FS: And we’re going to take you through
the Character Production Pipeline From Then
…
JH: … Until Now.
So speaking of now we have a big character
material library of steels and leathers and
fabrics and all that kind of stuff.
FS: Yep.
JH: And it’s really easy to swap stuff between
characters.
FS: Exactly.
JH: What was it like before on the old system?
FS: So the old system was a manual process.
It was very labour intensive. You had to go
into Photoshop, you had to go through each
of your layers, manually mask out where each
material goes. But you have to do that for
every single character.
JH: Right.
FS: So if you have a hundred characters that
are using a specific leather for example,
you have to update one hundred character Photoshop
files. Imagine updating one hundred character
Photoshop files as opposed to now …
JH: Right.
FS: Where you only have to update one.
JH: So that’s a lot of work to do a hundred,
obviously, a hundred …
FS: Right.
JH: … photoshop files for a hundred characters.
So now, since we’re able to swap all these
different pieces …
FS: Yeah.
JH: … and it sounds as if we are using one
leather example for everybody, we spend a
lot more time on that one …
FS: Right
JH: … leather because it’s going to be
seen everywhere.
FS: Imagine dedicating resources just to do
a leather for one hundred different characters.
Imagine trying to keep it consistent across
the board. It’s going to be very difficult.
And from an Art Director’s …
JH: Sure.
FS: … standpoint it’s a nightmare to deal
with right? Because you’re all about consistency
right?
JH: Yeah. And maybe in different lighting
scenarios they were totally different. When
in a dark … in the old system a dark environment
it would look bad but look great …
FS: Totally.
JH: … or vice versa. But now with this method
…
FS: Yeah.
JH: … it’s much more consistent.
FS: Yeah, it is consistent. The old method
didn’t really work with all lighting conditions
either. So a lot of times if you had an extreme
lighting condition you would not only have
to go to your Photoshop file in order to make
sure everything was correct, you would have
to do a variant of that texture to ensure
that it worked in that different lighting
condition.
JH: Right.
FS: And now you are getting exponentially
more. With the new method that we’re currently
using it’s flexible against all lighting
conditions, across all characters.
JH: Which is great.
FS: Fantastic.
JH: And one of the things I really like about
the new method is that when we zoom in the
fidelity of the textures is way higher than
the older one. You can zoom into the fabric
detail …
FS: Exactly.
JH: … to the stitch detail and it’s way,
way higher.
FS: Exactly. It allows us to do micro detail
now. So the previous method we were restricted
to our resolution. You had a d 2048x2048 pixel
resolution but your character is a hundred
thousand polys there’s not much space to
put that information.
JH: Yeah and if you zoomed in on something
it would get pixelly and crunchy.
FS: Starts getting blurry and all that stuff.
JH: Yeah.
FS: So we keep the old, traditional methods
which allows you to still have that unwrap
and that’s where we bake all our normal
information and all that stuff which handles
the way the light reacts and shadows on the
character without needing to have the geometry
there.
JH: The details from that are all picked up
the micro details.
FS: The micro detail. Yeah. So we have these
middle ... little normal maps that when you
get up close you can see them. So …
JH: Like all the threads and the little stuff.
FS: All the threads. So we’ve got a great
macro system and then a micro system so that
no matter what your distance from the character
is, you’re never getting that break down
of resolution.
JH: Right. Which is great because now we can
get up … and get those really nice zoomed
closed shots …
FS: Right.
JH: … and we can get those far shots …
FS: Yeah.
JH: … and they’re going to look equally
good in every possible lighting.
FS: Because you don’t want to break the
immersion. You want it to look real. If I
get like this …
JH: Yeah, yeah. Right. It looks good.
FS: Did that make you uncomfortable?
JH: No we’re good.
FS: [to camera] Did that make you uncomfortable?
JH: So now that we have a really good “then
and now” of our character pipeline …
FS: Right.
JH: … what is PBR?
FS: PBR stands for Physical Based Rendering.
Physical based rendering is the realistic
approach to rendering game surfaces based
on real world measurements. A non-PBR model
means you have no real world reference on
how the materials will actually react in the
real world. A physical based rendering system
on the other hand has a very accurate shading
model, to ensure that when the specular and
the light hits a surface it will react accordingly
to how that surface would actually react in
the real world.
The Nomad character for example had both metal
and fabric. In regards to PBR that’s two
different ends of the spectrum. One is reflective
and one is matt, which means that we had to
ensure that all of our specular settings were
correct so when the daylight hits the model
every surface reacts accordingly.
JH: So the character pipeline is all the different
types of phases that we are going to go through
to create a character. It typically starts
in concept phase, then it moves to a high
poly phase, followed by a low poly phase,
and then texturing and materials.
Jeremiah Lee (JL): 2D concepting is the very
first step of character development where
a concept artist will provide ideation sketches
provided by the design brief. 2D concepting
is very important in our pipeline because
it’s fast, it produces a quantity of ideas,
it’s loose - we can explore a lot of different
kinds of forms compared to working strictly
in 3D.
JH: the reason we chose 3D concepting for
the helmet with the Nomad is because it’s
very quick. Because it’s already in 3D it’s
really easy to transition to the high poly
phase. And for the Nomad it was a very tight
timeframe. Because we ended up choosing the
3D concept we were actually very, very close
to the end result and got to the high poly
phase much quicker.
Omar Aweidah (OA): High poly is usually the
first step in 3D visualisation of a character.
And it’s the first time - as you start to
assemble it together - you can start to see
it come to life. And that’s when we start
to figure out a lot of the problems and a
lot of the movements and most of the details
that go into the character. And we flesh that
out as far as we can to get the character
as realistic and to the quality level that
we want. And from that point on it goes into
the low poly modelling and retopo phase.
So for the high poly phase of the Sand Nomad
we used software called ZBrush. And ZBrush
is like an amazing tool that allows you to
go through different levels of detail. So
for example I worked on some of the arm for
the Nomad character and it’s really easy
to sculpt because I can get a base topology
down and get the shape and the silhouette
of the character. And then we’re able to
subdivide the polygons and continually go
up in detail which allows us to do a few different
types of things and get to more of a clay-like
substance. And as you can see the character
gets more and more detailed as we go up in
subdivision.
So this would essentially be like a base mesh
that we would start working with and we’d
get some of the rough shapes and start filling
out where all the assets go on the character,
and what essentially it’s going to look
like. Get a few different reads of the character.
And then we could subdivide him up.
And once he’s subdivided and we’ve done
all the passes - the sculpting passes - on
the character, we start to see our first real
iteration of what the character could look
like. And in this situation we can move around
different lighting: see how it reacts with
some of the shapes. Not really trying to capture
any materials or anything like this. At this
stage we’re essentially just looking at
character as a whole, from a first read, to
a second read, to a third read. Getting all
the levels of detail in from some of the bolds,
to the belt, to the way the fabric folds work.
Kind of how the character might actually look
when he’s brought into game.
And ZBrush is a critical component of our
pipeline and that allows us to subdivide the
model into … and get really, really high
resolution so we can see the character at
it’s most detailed phase.
Corey Johnson (CJ): The process for the low
poly for the Character team is pretty straight
forward. We use Maya and Topogun in terms
of software and our goal is to capture the
silhouette as much as possible while keeping
within the limits that are required for the
game.
The process for doing low poly in the character
team. We use Topogun or Maya to create it,
our focus is on capturing the silhouette and
making sure that the geometry isn’t too
high and that it won’t kill the framerate
in the game.
A low poly mesh is a simple mesh is built
up of quads and triangles to give us an approximation
of what our high poly sculpt is. So it’ll
end up being little squares that build up
the entire character.
FS: Our character pipeline uses a specular
physical based lighting model. So what that
means is when the light hits a surface, we
define on the surface, through the specular
channel exactly what type of surface that
is.
So here we are in a test map where we’re
doing some lookdev on some materials for the
Nomad. Let's show you some physical based
rendering stuff.
Right here we have a gold polished material.
Right here we have a very basic generic metal
And then right here we have a just very rough
microsurface pattern so it doesn’t have
much reflection.
So if I come over here in my gold and I’m
gonna go ahead and go to my glossiness which
is essentially a roughness value and when
I drag it down, you can see that we start
loosing the perfect reflection until it comes
all the way matte. That is because we’re
essentially making the surface to simulate
more roughness. The more roughness you have,
the more the specular is going to distribute
across a surface which is essentially a simulation
for heat distribution. So over on our character
we have this really slick way of actually
swapping out all the materials and doing all
this really awesome kind of thing.
So let me go ahead and get up in here and,
get up in here, that sounds weird… So let
me go ahead and select the best armour right
here and we’re going to try and play with
these materials a little bit here and show
you the system we’re working with.
So over here we have our diffuse tent, diffuse
wear, some gloss overrides. We have our blend
maps right in here, that way we can mask out
the different areas that we want to materials
to come through. Then we have our wear, dirt,
and ambient occlusion and our unique normal
maps.
So under here you have our colours so I want
to tint the different objects. So let me go
ahead and just kind of make this armour piece
white. What’s cool about this system too
is I can come over here to my armour piece
and can just quickly swap out exactly what
materials being referenced.
To make something like this gunmetal, I start
over in substance and create a series of unique
materials and then I start compositing them
to basically create a type of composite metal.
So multiple multiple different metals,start
combining them and we get this really cool
looking composite which is a little more interesting
than a pure precious metal because it has
some diffuse colour and detail in there.
Then we export our maps and we bring it in
the engine.
So let's come over here and let's say we wanted
metal pants. Why wouldn’t you want metal
pants? I think I’m going to go with a bronze.
Look at that, isn’t that fabulous? In fact
that is just so wonderful that I want to make
his undershirt the same.
Let’s go ahead and make that undersuit bronze,
whoa, look at that…
Up here we have a cloth attachment that kind
of moves around when you rotate the character
and not only does it move around, but it has
a cloth shader applied to it. So you can see
we get this really nice fernell highlight
on here. So let me jump over to it, and if
I shift the colour you can really start seeing
that cloth shader in action. Let me go to
red and you can see those highlights, and
that other colour is a secondary reflection
so let me kind of match it a little closer.
Really nice red.
So I’m going to go and take that red and
we have a couple settings here, we have a
diffuse falloff so I can strengthen it or
lighten it. So we have these super cool colours
going on, we got this bronze undersuit with
this super cool black and white armour piece,
so we’re just really quickly swapping out
everything on these characters.
Do some colour adjustment, make it look like
it matches the uniform more. Make it kind
of dark. Jump over to the cloak, do the same.
Awesome, and there’s a very quickly modified
character.
JH: So as you can tell, we’ve got a whole
character pipeline that’s really coming
along well. One of the big things that we’re
trying to focus on right now is modularity.
What that means is creating and combining
all of our different assets so that they can
work with each other. When you’re buying
clothes, that all the different pant options
fit with all the shirt options. When you're
buying hats, when you’re buying jackets
that they fit on all the shirts. Which doesn’t
sound like a big deal, but it’s actually
really important. The reason it’s really
important is so that we can provide players
the optimal experience for variety and what
they can buy, not just in clothes, but also
armour. So we’re doing this with armour
as well so you can wear different types of
armour on different types of suits that can
mix and match and you can create the best
combination for what your playstyle is.
The other thing that we're really focusing
on now which you’ve had a little bit of
a sneak peek about is creatures.
So in the future we’re going to be doing
all these awesome characters and creatures.
Worms as you’ve seen, insects, alien lifeforms
that are going to fill out these awesome worlds.
With the strong character pipeline in place,
any of this is possible.
Outro
SG: That was great. Really interesting to
see how they blend 2D and 3D concepting to
create a character.
CR: Yeah well PBR rendering really is a cool
piece of tech. It’s taken a lot of effort
to bring our character pipeline to where it
currently is, but seeing the Sand Nomad’s
come to life in the Homestead demo just shows
that all that hard work is really paying off.
SG: And there you have it, that’s about
it for today’s show, but before we go do
you want to share an update on what’s happening
with 2.6?
CR: Sure.
SG: Yes you do.
CR: Alright so for Star Marine, design’s
finished for the latest round of adjustments
on the Damian map which is our smaller space
station combat map, and it’s been handed
back to Art for their pass while Design moves
onto Echo 11 which is this sort of bigger
map that’s based on an asteroid base.
We’ve been working on improving our hit
and death reactions to make them feel more
satisfying. Animations also been doing some
further testing on combat signaling and the
emote system to see if an override animation
solution or an additive solution will produce
better results.
Lets see… the new Arena Commander mode Pirate
Swarm is in testing along with new AI profiles
that are currently being balanced. The fix
for the new pickups are in now so audio can
begin their pass, just as a note, audio is
usually one of the last things to touch things
because you don’t want to have everything
change and they have change the sounds afterwards.
Lets see, a couple of interesting blockers
popped up as well. In Vanduul swarm, players
and AI we’re getting placed on the wrong
team, seems Warlord and Vixen weren’t quite
as trustworthy as they seem.
Tech Design had a strange bug where a mysterious
force pushed players away when they had to
enter ships with interior grids and if you
try it again it would kill you so that’s
not very good.
We also had a bug with the Herald where the
Cockpit windows turned opaque so you couldn’t
see out of them and therefore pretty hard
to fly.
So speaking of the Herald, both the Herald
and Vanguard Hoplite are receiving the last
round of polish for their upcoming release
in the 2.6 Alpha.
SG: There you have it everyone and to get
more insight on everything Star CItizen, make
sure to tune in tomorrow at 11am PST, 7PM
GMT and 8PM In most of Europe for Reverse
the Verse. The team here in L.A. will be answering
questions on what we just showed.
CR: Yup and also wanted to let everyone know
that ATV will be on hiatus next week as everyone
gears up for our anniversary livestream which
is on Friday, November 18th. We’ll have
more details about what to expect on the website
so be sure to check it out.
SG: And until then, we will see you.
SG/CR: Around the Verse!
