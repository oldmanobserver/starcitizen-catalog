Chris Roberts (CR): Hello, welcome to another
episode of 10 for the Chairman.
For those of you who haven’t watched this
before this is where I take 10 questions from
our subscribers.
Our subscribers are the subset of our community
that contribute money every month to enable
us to do all of our enhanced community content.
This show, Around the ‘Verse, all the other
ones we do like, Bug Smashers, Jump Point
which is this 40-70 page behind the scenes
magazine that we publish digitally, monthly
that goes into the details on how we design
the ships, game design, plus lore and we have
fiction in it so it’s really quite a cool
read.
It has lots of sort of details of behind the
scenes and that’s all made possible by the
subscribers that are contributing the money
that really keeps our community team and enhanced
community stuff going which I think it makes
a difference to Star Citizen and it’s one
of the reasons why we’re able to update
you guys and connect all the time and I think
it makes for a really great development environment.
Thank you very much to subscribers for that
and as part that deal I try to answer 10 questions
from them every week when I’m able to shoot
this show, which isn’t always the case because
this year I mentioned on a couple previous
shows that I’ll be back and forth between
here and Europe quite a lot.
Obviously we have teams around the world and
infact we have more people now in Europe now
than we do in the US and we’ve got a lot
going on, Squadron 42 obviously and then of
course what we’re doing with SC Alpha Live
which we just went to the 2.2 version and
now everyone's sort of coming down off that.
There will be a few little cleanup and fixes
on that, but everyone is focusing on 2.3 which
is the next major patch that is also bringing
some pretty cool new functionality … It
never stops in the world of Star Citizen,
anyways let's get to the 10 questions.
First one comes from ...
[2:12] Starripper asks: Are there any plans
to stream line the patch sizes?
I am on the road a lot and use my cellular
data to update Star Citizen, the updates ear
up a lot of gigs right now especially when
there are multiple patches.
So yes absolutely.
We have a plan, in fact I sat down earlier
this week which would be the previous week
to you seeing this as we’re recording this
on a Friday and you’re going to watch this
on a Monday.
But yeah I think we have a really cool plan
that’s very configured to our new development
paradigm.
Not saying new for us, but the new paradigm
of what we’re doing which is constantly
building, testing, deploying both internally
and then externally to, you guys in the community
at first level the Public Test Universe the
PTU then of course to live and so we needed
a solution that we can can be building rapidly
and iterating rapidly and getting it to you
as efficiently as possible.
And our current one is not the best because
it has these big monolithic PAK files and
each PAK file is two gigs and there’s quite
a few of them and if one file changes in it,
you have to rebuild the whole PAK file and
the way our build system works with all the
data is we have to rebuild all the data into
the PAK files right now, which essentially
means we spend about three hours if we do
a full build about an hour if we just do a
code build.
But that’s a huge amount, so it’s problematic
in terms of getting that done and then testing
it instead of there’s an issue then you
have to go back.
So we want a solution that’s much more flexible
and iterative and we also want one that means
we’re not saturating everyone’s bandwidth.
Cause it’s not just on you guys side but
it’s also on our side.
Every byte we push costs us money ‘cause
it’s coming off the Amazon CDN that we’re
using.
So we have a plan that I think is much cooler,
smarter one that is all built all around incremental
builds of both data and code as soon as it’s
assimilated into the code base and all the
individual files are tagged and held in a
huge object store and the patch will know
what to pull down and what changed.
So even if you’ve changed a couple of files
no longer will we be pulling down a whole
new two gig object PAK or something like that.
It will just be pulling down the specific
files, it will also allow them to version
back and forth between them.
So there’s a really really cool plan it’s
going to be done by combination of DevOps
team in Austin and the folks in the Frankfurt
office and Turbulent are all putting this
together and building and it’s going to
be super cool!
Not going to be deployed tomorrow.
I just signed off on the whole design, we’ve
laid a lot of the groundwork but a lot of
it is going to take some time and testing
but when it comes online it’s going to make
a massive difference for our ability to turn
around builds for you guys quickly and also
to reduce the amount of data that we saturate
both our CDN and you guys on your bandwidth
limits.
So i’m pretty excited by that it will just
allow us to be more flexible and more nimble
which is good.
So next question
[5:30] Narcoman asks: Aside from shopkeepers,
quest-givers, and other NPCs considered essential
in other games, are NPCs in a given area going
to be generated randomly based on the current
environment and the parameters set in the
area?
CR: So what’s going to happen is that we
have a universe simulation that runs on a
separate server.
That’s much more of a big picture simulation.
Think of it kind of like a Civilization game
or something like that.
Sort of a slower turn based game.
That actually is simulating the universe,
what all the NPCs are doing, on a macro basis.
Who’s trading with what?
What’s producing what?
What goods are needed where?
Where pirates are attacking?
The sort of general outcomes of those results
are all happening on the universe simulation
and it’s own process.
Then that is getting trickled down to the
local game servers that all the players (i.e.
you guys), are attaching to and playing in.
The snapshot of what’s happening on the
universe server is sort of carried across
the game server.
What would happen is, for instance, if you
were down on a planet it would say, “Okay,
well this planet is a mining planet and, you
know, so I’ll generate and the population
is this size; therefore, we’ll probably
populate the landing area with ‘X’ number
of NPCs, 60% of them will be miners, and then
we’ll have some law enforcement, and you
know we’ll have some service workers in
the bars and stuff like that.”
It will all be generated by the data that’s
pulled down, or pushed down, from the universe
server, so it will dynamically change.
If a place becomes… turns on hard luck times
or whatever and there starts to be unemployment
or people start moving off world to go somewhere
else to seek jobs, and the population is lowered,
then you’ll see less people in the landing
area.
Perhaps the mine shuts down so then you won’t
really see miners anymore.
Maybe the criminal element will increase because
there’s nothing to be done in that area
where you can be gainfully employed so people
are turning to crime.
So what’s gonna happen is there’s going
to be a loose, fuzzy, connection to what’s
happening on the universe simulation with
what you actually see when you’re moving
around personally in the game.
It will change with what happens in the universe.
Of course what happens in the universe is
influenced by what players also do in the
game as well.
So the AI meta actions are all handled on
the server and then the player actions are
simulated in those local game instances.
Like for instance, you guys connect to Crusader
right now, and results from that will be pushed
back up to the universe server and then that
will effect things like pirate count and some
stuff like that.
If there’s pirates preying on a cargo run
between two planets, say they’re AI pirates,
then the company that’s not getting the
goods because the pirates keep attacking its
shipments hires some bounty hunters (i.e.
you the players), to go after the pirates
in the area or take them out.
You do and you go and kill the pirates that
are there, the 20 pirates or whatever, then
that gets pushed back up to the universe simulator
and the universe simulator says, “Okay,
let me kill the 20 pirates.”
If that kills all the pirates on the universe
simulator, when you go back and fly that area
back on the local game server instance, no
longer will pirates be a potential spawning
encounter because there’s no pirates in
that area anymore whereas before there were.
So that’s kinda how the connection happens
between the game and the universe simulation
and I think that it should be pretty cool
and be pretty dynamic.
So you will definitely feel impact from overall...
macro movements and player influence.
You should sort of feel places change with
time depending on what’s happening in the
universe, so it should be cool.
[9:27] Krel asks: Within the context of fantasy
space flight (Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica,
etc) and given how you're implementing the
flight model in Star Citizen, how do you see
the importance of positioning relative to
an opponent playing out?
Should there be an advantage to getting on
your target's 'six' and staying there, or
is that pretty much negated by 6DOF flight?
I will say that in all circumstances even
with 6DOF and the ability to do lateral, horizontal
and vertical strafing as well as being able
to change your orientation and maybe now your
velocity vector, which is sort of the decoupled
stuff.
Always getting behind someone or in their
blind side is always a bit of an advantage.
Now the difference in our system and flight
model.
If you’re a good pilot you’ll be able
to be able to get out of that situation.
You’ll have more options than you do in
regular atmospheric air combat maneuvering.
But obviously you want to get behind someone
because they can’t bring their guns, most
guns are forward facing, also visibility is
usually forward facing.
So, outside of the bigger ships with turrets
then getting behind people or swarming in
a dogfight usually will give you an edge or
an advantage even if they can recover from
it quicker than they can in traditional current
day atmospheric air combat.
[10:47] J. Stalker asks: We already have a
flyable Constellation and a flyable P-52 Merlin.
How far are we from a workable tech for docking
and undocking?
Is this something we can expect in the near
future -or is this a functionality planned
further down the line
CR: I really want to actually get the p-52
and the constellation to work together cause
they are meant to work together.
It’s probably something we’ll start to
work on with Craig Grounsell who’s done
the sort of landing systems.
Still got some landing system stuff that he’s
wrapping up for Squadron 42, and some enhancements
for star citizen, and this will probably be
the next task to get this working.
It’s not that difficult.
Basically you just kind of want to get, it’s
just like the landing system really.
You get in a certain area and you say “ok,
dock” and we just sort of bring you in and
connect you, and the merlin would be attached
to the constellation, and then hopefully you
get out and should just be able to enter into
the back of the Constellation.
So I do want to get it moving ‘cause it’s
actually not that difficult, technically,
to get working.
It’s really just people have had a whole
bunch of other things they are working on
first.
For instance, you know, we, ah haven’t shown
it yet, but you know we have an Idris flying
around and you can land inside it, and take
off inside it, and walk around it, and it’s
pretty cool.
So, that was sort of the higher priority,
and we’ve still got some to do on the bigger
ships in terms of building it out, like we
have this object contain system which we detailed
in our February monthly report that just came
out, and you know that’s kind of how, well,
all the future sort of big stuff like big
space ships or space stations and, you know,
even the landing areas will be taken care
of.
It’s sort of like containers of geometry
and objects and stuff that can be nested inside
each other, and sort of stream in and out
depending on the situation, and that’s how
we’ll bring in the interiors of the bigger
ships and stuff like that.
So we’re doing that but obviously trying
to have a dockable Merlin with a Constellation
is, you know, on our list.
[12:50] Mediocrates asks: Will there be a
realistic audio option e.g. No sound in a
vacuum, so you just hear stuff hitting your
ship as the muffled sound travels through
the structure, and lasers/photons are soundless?
So short term absolutely no.
Not because, we’ve sort of gone for the
sort of Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica route
where we have sound because generally that’s
kind of cool even though it’s maybe not
quite as realistic.
Longer term I could see the sound department
getting to the end of all the features we
want them to implement and do sort of a realistic
sound simulation option which I won't be against,
I would just prefer to finish up a bunch of
other stuff like, the music system.
We’ve now got our 2.0 Music System and this
sort of positional Voice Over IP that we want
to do.
So when you’re in a group on a ship I can
talk and you’ll hear me and if I’m in
front of you you’ll hear my voice coming
from the front, if I’m behind you’ll hear
me coming from behind, my voice will be filtered
if I’m speaking through a helmet, etc, etc,
all those things.
So all of that’s sort of ahead of the queue
than doing stuff of the realistic space sound
option, but I wouldn’t rule it out longer
term because we have a pretty talented audio
department and they’ve been doing some pretty
awesome stuff both on the sound creation,
but also on the simulation, programming side.
Okay next question comes from.
[14:24] Nimryl asks: What is your intent in
regards to personally owned NPC'ed fleets?
Is it your intent to add as many controllable
NPCs as possible per person if the technology
allows?
We definitely are going to allow you to hire
some NPCs to help you crew a bigger ship or
perhaps fly as an escort for you when you're
running a mission or perhaps fly a transport
for you, but we're probably going to cap that
to a certain number.
We haven't decided yet, because we haven't
really gotten into that.
We still got obviously a lot of performance
things to figure out.
Like how many NPCs we can have running in
the same area or instance as well as how many
players can run in the same area or instance.
So, we wouldn't want to have an infinite amount
for people doing in there.
There's a certain level you don’t want to
have that cause it can become incredibly unbalanced.
So, I don’t have a great answer for that
right now, but I would say it not going to
be as many as theoretically you could allow.
There will be some level of cap on it, but
it will be what would make sense for you to
have some help in the cases you need and,
perhaps different things would have different
amounts.
So, if you have an Idris then you and some
friends need to fly but you also need a bit
of a crew and that could maybe have a few
more NPCs in that situation than you would
if you were hiring individual NPCs to fly
escorts.
So, you couldn’t have 10 NPCs flying 10
Hornets for instance.
But we haven’t come up with the actual numbers
because obviously it needs balancing for both
game play reasons and performance reasons.
[15:50] Captain Awesome asks: So the Endeavor
has bio-domes.
What will be the point of farming?
And will there be bacon farming?
CR: Well the point of farming will be the
biodomes will allow you to grow agriculture,
crops and you’ll be able to sell those probably
for a premium.
So the idea would be bio-domes on the Endeavour
are growing things you couldn’t necessarily
grow on a planet.
Then you can maybe sell for a premium, whatever
it will be.
I’m sure lots of people will go “Space
weed!”.
But there’ll be plenty of other things too.
So it’s a sort of farming mechanic so you
would have that in space.
You would maintain it like perhaps you would
have to take the, your ship would have to
be a certain distance from the local system
star or you may have to fend for it make sure
it’s grown in perhaps the lower gravity
setup, makes you able to grow a better strain
of whatever it would be: wheat, etc.
So there you go.
I don’t know about bacon farming.
Bacon farming I’m guessing is: ok we’re
going to have pigs or cows or something like
that.
I would think at some point we may do livestock
but I would definitely say in the first iteration
or two we probably won’t do it just ‘cause
of the issues of: ok now i’ve got a bio-dome
full of 20 cows or something.
But longer term we may but short term it will
probably be much more vegetation or plant
based, that you would have to farm.
Farm, so a little Farmville so to speak.
[17:19] Coryphaeus asks: I would like to know
more about the procedural tech.
You've talked about consulting linguists for
alien languages, are you talking to exobiologists,
exoplanetologists, and exo-climatologists
for direction and help in designing the ecosystems
and climates of alien planets?
CR: That’s a good question.
I, we have done a certain amount of working
with a local school here in L.A. actually.
So UCLA we’ve been dealing with some astrophysicists
and their ilk, in terms of laying out our
star systems and what kind of planets would
be what distance from the stars.
That dictates the type of planet.
To a certain extent what we do is we say “Well
we want this kind of planet”.
Then we talk to the folks that really know
and say “So what situation could we potentially
get this planet in?”.
And they’ll say “Well then maybe it needs
to be this distance, this many Au from the
star and …”.
And that’s so how we on a macro side have
been doing the star system map and some of
that will filter into the procedural tech.
But it’s still early days on the, kind of
figuring out the ecosystems of the planets
and the weather patterns and all the rest
of the stuff.
I would guess that we would tend to go a little
bit more towards a designed approach where
it’s like taking a look at Hoth.
It’s an ice planet and it’s cool, but
is the whole planet covered in snow or is
it..I mean it certainly looks like when you
watch the movie.
Would that be realistic?
Would there ever be life on a planet like
that?
Maybe, maybe not I don’t know.
But you very much define the planets like,
using my Star Wars reference here: Hoth is
the ice planet, Tatooine is like a desert
planet and so you got, you go to the Dagobah
system and it’s all like this swampy jungle
thing.
Very much in Star Wars they focus the planets
to feel like it’s a type, it’s a jungle,
or it’s an ice planet, or it’s a desert
planet.
So we’ll probably do a little bit of that,
maybe not quite as much of that.
But we’ll definitely do some of that, ‘cause
I think it really helps in terms of identifying
the planets and stuff.
So there’ll be a combination of a little
bit of science and what we think fiction or
lore wise, kind of gameplay wise would help.
So there you go.
A little bit of it, but not a massive amount.
[19:47] Kyran asks: Now that Vulkan is officially
released, has the Frankfurt team had the chance
to dive in to see about supporting this API
alongside DirectX 12?
CR: We have looked at Vulkan, we’re pretty
excited by it.
So we are considering our options between
Vulkan and DirectX 12 we haven’t made a
full decision.
But Vulkan has some advantages, the biggest
one being, as long as it works properly that
it can work on a PC but also work on Linux
and work on other platforms, where as DirectX
12 is specifically just for Windows.
They are both very similar architectures,
essentially Vulkan’s not that different
from what Mantle was originally set up to
be.
So we’re considering it.
You never know whether we will do DirectX
12 or Vulkan first.
Steve posted for that one!
[20:50] Augustus Kron asks: What hobbies (outside
of Star Citizen) are you struggling to keep
up with over the past couple of years?
CR: Yeah there isn’t much life outside of
Star Citizen, unfortunately, it’s tough.
I would say the few things I get to do, I
like playing tennis.
That’s a sport I played when I was young
and I still do it, and it’s good for exercise.
I don’t actually play football, or soccer
to everyone in America, anymore.
I used to.
That was, unfortunately, about 30-40 pounds
ago and there may be a correlation between
not playing football and getting older.
I still watch it a lot.
I’m from Manchester, and I’ve always supported
Manchester United.
I watch Premiership games over here in America,
and when I’m in the UK, I watch them there
or actually go to some live games.
That, play some games, or try to play some
games when I got a little bit of spare time.
That’s really hard.
See some movies, obviously a big movie fan.
That’s pretty much it.
I don’t really have much time to do many
other things than that.
Maybe once Star Citizen is done, then I’ll
take a lot of time off and get back into some
of my hobbies.
For instance, I think I’ve shown off my
little miniature Napoleonic figures from when
I used to war game.
I haven’t…
Ever since I started doing Wing Commander
onwards, I haven’t had a chance to do things,
like gaming, the same way I used to do a long
time ago.
It all takes time.
I actually used to think when I went to school,
“I can’t wait till I’m not going to
school, and have all this time to do these
other things.”
I look back on it and realize that, when I
was actually going to school, I had lots of
time for hobbies and now I don’t have that
much time, but c’est la vie.
Outro
So there you go.
That’s the end of my answers for 10 For
the Chairman.
Thank you, guys, for listening.
Hopefully, some of the answers were informative
and useful for you guys.
Thank you to all the subscribers that enable
us to put together content like this and all
the other stuff that we do here for Star Citizen
at Roberts Space Industries.
And thank you to all the backers, ‘cause
without all you guys contributing and supporting
the project, we wouldn’t be where we are
now.
It’s pretty monumental, but it’s enabling
us to building something that I don’t think
anyone would have ever conceived you could
build, and certainly no publisher would have
ever dreamed of doing.
We aren’t there yet, but we’re getting
there.
I think you can sort of see the progress.
There’s more and more features and gameplay
coming online on Star Citizen Alpha, you know,
2.x live.
As we go and this year, there’ll be a lot
of stuff that comes online that I think will
really sort of add to the experience.
But even right now, sort of in 2.1, now 2.2,
there’s just –there’s a lot of cool
immersion gameplay that’s happening.
There will be more of that happening and I
think we’re building something that, long
term’s, gonna be….
Well it’s the game I wanna play, and I think
it’s the game, hopefully, a lot of you guys
wanna play.
So, anyway, ‘til next time.
Talk to 
you later.
