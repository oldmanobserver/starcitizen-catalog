Hey everyone, welcome to Bug Smashers.
Today we're going on the other side, the
right side.
Bug Smashers.
Hey everyone, we are here in the awesome
test level again and I have down that
hornet from last week which we're using
to test out the new item system and it
has some fun little red balls because
well things break. But that's actually
some of the items. I think that's the
shield and that's the cooler. So let's
plop down.
And
unlike last time where I had a little
debug text on the top, we're now using
uh the inner thought system. Um, and
this bug is when I get inside my
weapons, which you can
you can see on the player actually are
still visible and clipping through
geometry. So, um, what the animation
guys wanted was a way to turn on and off
at least the models. So when you plop in
the game, your models basically just
vanish and then when you get back out,
they appear again. So
let's turn off the free cam and let's
enter the seat, see what it looks like
with the models.
So as my guy climbs up, you can see the
guns are right on them. They clip
through everything and
the clip through his hands and his legs.
All right.
So if we leave the game
um
pop into the code. So what I have done
is I created this um new bit of code
called a proc clip. And what it does is
allows the animators to basically
specify if something should be shown,
hidden, or just keep the state as it is.
And if they're playing an animation, we
have a enter and a um exit state. So if
we're playing an animation and we enter
it, we may want to hide the weapon, but
not necessarily show it again after the
animation is done because we may have
another set of animations. So then
whenever the animation plays to show the
the weapon then they could set it
accordingly. So what I did in my test is
anytime I play the idle animation which
is right here.
Uh, it plays all this fun little anim
animations for like GeForces and look
iike and it will actually play this um
procedural clip which will when the
animation plays it will hide our weapons
and when it when we leave the exit it'll
show the weapons. But again animators
could if they want to get rid of this
and change it any which way. So, you
know, as you're climbing up in the
enter, it hides it. And then when you
sit down, it's still hidden. And then
when you get out of your seat during
some animation, it plays.
So, uh, so these are the the params. So,
basically, all this fancy dancy stuff
right here gets set up in this spot. And
then this is the actual procedural
uh clip. And as you can see, when we
enter, we set our states and we update
the weapon visibility when we both enter
and exit. And what we do is if depending
upon if we show or hide, we tell the
player suit manager, hey, we want to
hide our weapons. And what this guy does
in the player suit manager, it actually
goes through all the item ports that we
have. And if they're weapons or gizmos,
it will basically hide all the ports and
any subports. All your magazines, your
extended attachments will be hidden. And
then once this gets triggered again,
we'll make all that visible. So, uh,
before I had this code disabled to show
you guys what it was before, and now I
reenable it and recode everything.
Uh, recode.
Recode. Awesome.
Ah, and recode finished. So, if we plop
down in the game,
open up our ladder, open up our canopy,
and of course, just for a sneak peek,
you don't have to do just one. You could
actually hold F and select some other
interactions. So, I could actually open
up uh the co-pilot canopy. All right.
So, let's enter quickly. Turn in our
free cam.
And as you can see, our weapons there.
And then as soon as we play the idle
animation, poof, it's gone.
And then
I turn off free cam.
We'll disable
wrong thing. We'll leave the seat.
And what do you know? Our weapons are
back clipping through everything. So, of
course, they have to get tuned.
and I hit a button to leave the seat.
And so, of course, this will have to get
tuned by the animators so that certain
anim will turn them on and off at
certain key frames of the animation. But
for now, this works for fun little
tests. And I'm sure sometime in the
future, we'll have a nice little res in
and res out effect so it just won't go.
But
for now, it just vanishes. Hope you guys
enjoyed and I'm out. So, we had a little
fun bug with our new item system where
if you go up on the ladder and you sit
down, your weapons all clip through
everything. Uh, that's actually
happening right now in the current game,
but we wanted a way to address that. And
since we have a whole bunch of wide
ranges of cockpits and all crazy things,
it's going to be hard to hide them,
especially when you have big suits,
small suits, and all that fun. So, what
we decided to do was res out the weapons
um when you get down into the seat and
depending upon what area of the
animation you're in, we'll show and hide
them. And so, we added a little prop
clip to makes it so that the animators
could do that. And now we just got to
add in the res in res out effect. And
then we're good to go. Hope you guys
enjoyed. Till next time.
