Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome to
Bug Smashes, I got nothing witty.
Like I said, I got nothing witty.
You’re gonna use that aren’t you?
Tom Hennessy (TH): Let's start.
MA: [Laughs]
Hey everyone, we have a fun little bug here.
I have a test Hornet which I use and abuse
to put all sorts of items on.
As you can see, I threw an airlock on the
wing because why not.
This is mostly so I can test the interaction
system and we’ve got a bug in that when
items get removed off ships like this airlock,
it has no physics and as you can see here,
this airlock is attached to my lovely Hornet
and it has physics on the door; However there’s
no physics anywhere on this airlock when it’s
plopped down and same thing with pretty much
any of this other items.
If I go in here there’s physics for the
seats, physics for the weapon, but not when
it gets plopped down.
So what happens?
Well let's snap into the code.
So let me open up the fun…
Eh I’ll open up the item…
Where are you item, somewhere hiding.
Visual assist does not, ah, there you are.
Alright, so our legacy item which is this
guy and our new items, they have a physics
controller.
Where are you, there you are.
We have a physics controller which is a separate
component that handles the physics for this
item.
Both the legacy item which is this guy right
here and our new item just both go and use
this guy, and we have a call back for physicalizing.
We were just there, let's go find you.
We want the physicalization mode.
Going through the fun mess, Aha!
Physicalized.
Out and about.
Alright here’s our fun physicalization function.
So to get this item working with our physicalized
component we have to do basically a callback
to do special methods.
So, when we physicalize we’ll tell our physics
controller to basically physicalize our entity
and then it will do a callback to come back
to the item because the item has to do some
special love, and whenever we physicalize
we have to define a slot.
Basically we have an entity and it can have
multiple slots and each slot could have a
character or it could have some geometry.
We could have a wallet geometry and a phone
and they both belong to this entity, and each
one would be into a slot.
You could have multiple slots for the entity
active at one time or you could have one at
a time.
For example the legacy items, if it’s...
we could switch between an auxiliary or third
person geometry, we mostly stick with third
person, but auxiliary is for like attachments.
You could do things like you’re if in first
person you have switched to this geometry,
if you’re in first person you switched to
this geometry, but either way we have to define
a slot to physicalize and the item and old
items, they have one slot which they physicalize
on, but they also have another physicalization
slot for the interaction system which is these
fun little proxies right there and unfortunately
we have to physicalize a bunch of slots.
So rather than sending in a specific number,
we can send in a negative one.
If we go to the physics controller.
This is what we use for the new items and
as you can see if it’s a rigid body, we
pass a negative one saying, “Physicalize
every single slot you have” and unfortunately
our physics controllers is the top level and
the physics proxies are bottom level and then
we have super, super low physics.
So our entity, physics controller, physics
proxy and physics.
Our entity tells physics controller, “I
want to physicalize”, it does a call back
and then it eventually goes the physics proxy
to set up a whole bunch of crazy parameters
and then finally gets the physics and our
guy has physics, it’s cray cray.
Basically our item gets here, goes to the
physics controller, we say slot negative one,
it gets to the physics proxy and we land here.
When we have negative one, we have to go through
all these physics slots and add it to physics
and say, “Hey, make this thing have physics”,
but unfortunately in this param, we when pass
since slot negative one, we also pass in this
param in here and when we add the slot geometry
it gets the param if it’s a character or
physics, it checks to see if the slots negative
one, but we set in there negative one because
we want everything to go.
So we have to do a little trick where we say,
when equal to the current slot and then we’ll
reset it.
So since everything, unfortunately this is
the params, we’ll just say, “Hey, just
use, we’ll assign the correct slot so everything
below the physics proxy gets passed in correctly
and then when we go the next slot we do the
same thing over and over again”.
And we build this guy.
So now my super duper wallet and my super
duper phone both have physics instead of going,
“Oh my gosh we’re slot negative one, abort”.
Woo because this guy doesn’t want to do
physics.
Alright as this compiles, we are going to
see the awesome result.
Best sellody.
Alright we’re back into the editor, let's
draw our physics.
Haha!
We now have physics when we plop down this
door.
So if I were to hop in this game, weee, my
ship goes crazy, but since I have physics
I can now open it.
We I can at least shoot it, I guess the animations
broke, all fun.
Heh It had to open up that door, oh that’s
great.
Ha ha.
That’s another bug for another time, [Epic
thumbs up]
As you saw we had a fun little physics issue
where if we had an item and we attached to
[Holds an apple] yes this is a ship, pretend
it’s an airlock, it has physics!
Awesome, but as soon as we detach it we don’t
have physics anymore.
Problem was with the good old low level component
when we try to physicalize all the slots,
we send the negative one, but it was aborting
out because negative one’s invalid so we
just had to make sure that when it goes through
each slot we set the appropriate value for
the slot, everything physicalized and now
our apple is a real boy.
Hope you guys enjoyed, see you guys next time,
cheers!
