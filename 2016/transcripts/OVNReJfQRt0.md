hey everyone welcome back to bug
Smashers sorry we couldn't do it last
week I was at E4 for everyone no that
was horrible but I'm going to go to E3
cuz that's going to be fun you wish you
were there I'm be there you want to go
there we'll meet you there all right
let's start the
show box speci
[Music]
hey everyone we're here in my fun little
Port Port awesome as you can see
everything here is awesome
except there's one thing not awesome
when I spawn some ships in they seem to
be falling through the
ground so let's spawn in our Scout ship
ship is spawned and I have powers to go
through walls because I'm in Port
[Music]
awesome as you can see my awesome ship
is no longer awesome and it teleported
or spawned inside of the level
Joy normally this wouldn't happen in
single player but you guys will see this
a lot in multiplayer when you spawn a
ship sometimes instead of it's spawning
on the platform it just spawns inside
and then
goes so what's happening let's go to the
code so when we have a ship and we spawn
it uh we get a call back saying that our
vehicle is spawned on the server and
then we have some code here to look up
the landing position and move the ship
into the proper position however uh
let's use this awesome pencil um if this
is the origin of the ship and this is
the landing gear and the origin's here
I'm going to spawn inside and explode so
we have this thing uh right here which
is The Landing Pad Helper and the idea
is you could have a position right here
saying this is where the landing
position should be not the spawn origin
so going back here instead of spawning
here I'll spawn like this only problem
is this call back happens
after we spawn and what we're doing is
we're actually positioning the ship here
and then the call back happens then we
move it
up um not good especially since it may
take a little bit before physics
physicalize and all of our items get on
so we may spawn here an item May pop in
and then all of a sudden we're
intersecting things exploding not good
so instead of putting our position in
you know after we spawn um we have to
put it in as a prerequirement uh to
where we spawn so instead of spawning
here we have to spawn at that offset so
if our spawn Point's here we need to
calculate what our theoretical offset
will be which will be right here so
we're going to spawn on the top instead
on the
bottom however we can't do that right
away because this bit of code relies on
the fact that the vehicle has spawned
and we could get that bone position so
what we had to do was go in all of our
xmls pre-calculate that offset stick it
in our implementation XML so that we
know how far it off before we even spawn
the ship so if we get rid of this lovely
code and actually go where we request
the
spawn uh I have this new fun bits of
code that will get the vehicle pams get
the spawn loc and it will move the spawn
location
so if we go here so the going from the
top down we're going to set up our
vehicle to spawn and we're going to tell
it to spawn at this spawn location but
we're going to apply an offset where the
vehicle pram says hey you need to move
this much from the origin of the ship so
we take that position and here's our
spawn and we're actually going to move
it up up so now our new spawn offset is
up here and that's what this fun little
bit of math will do get our um world
Matrix and it will apply the offset in
World space so that we get the new
location so
now when we request our spawn we'll be
at the new location instead of
teleporting there or spawning here and
then moving up so let's do some recode
and give it a try
yeah all right so we just did a
recompile the code so let's fly all the
way back into our ship spawning which
should be here we
are let's
respawn no I got to wait 30 seconds
luckily I have developer mode and I can
cheat with time those seconds go away
haha let's request our ship spawn
again teleport way up and voila our ship
is now in the correct position because
we spawn it in the correct position
rather than spawn in the incorrect
position and then move it
back now there is still some bugs where
I think it was with the Aurora where
after we spawn it it slowly rotates
around but that's another whole fun
physics thing maybe on another bug
Smashers but until then see you guys so
we had a little fun bug here with our
Landing system you know we were spawning
the ship in the ground and then moving
him up when we should just spawn him in
the correct offset so we hooked up that
code made sure that he spawns you know
offset correctly and now you won't spawn
and see your ship exploded into a
billion pieces you will see some fun
things like the Aurora twisting around
but that's just an issue with the how
we're dealing with physics and the the
landing and not putting it's a whole
another thing probably get to it
eventually in a bug Smashers but until
next time see you
