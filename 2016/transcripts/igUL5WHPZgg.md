Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, back from Gamecom.
Time for a little breeze, yeah, take a little
chill pill… just kidding.
We got two six and time to fix some bugs.
Hey everyone, we are in a fun little test
level for FPS and there’s a bug that the
good folks in the UK managed to fix where
sometimes when you go about shooting and killing
each other and die.
Tough kill, my death’s been…
been practicing that all day but when you
die sometimes, aha, just like that all your
weapons sights and attachments go, gone.
It’s like, whaaatttt and the crazy part
is we go on third person and then back, they
magically show up.
So obviously this is a crazy bug cause it’s
like, hey that should not be happening.
Oh boy, this one took a little while because
each of those little bits are on an item port
and item ports are basically things that allow
designers to say, ‘hey this should snap
here’.
Maybe allow for some user configurations and
dictate, all right, this thing can be a little
scope, that can attach, what size scope.
You know, a bunch of little interesting customizations
but since they’re on item ports it leads
to a whole big slew of what’s the problem.
Is it an item port issue?
Is it an attachment issue?
Item ports use attachments and they used to
follow the bone, so we have a little bone
there that the little attachment would follow.
So it’s like, oh no what’s happening.
Then it gets weirder because it’s like,
how come when I go first person, third person
it works again and as I kill myself sometimes
you get it, sometimes you don’t.
I think I have it where I get it 100% of the
time but when you first spawn into the server
you may not get it.
Such a weird, fun little bug and it took the
good old folks in the UK to find what’s
happening.
So we have our item and when we attach our
item, sometimes we have to detach it and do
some configuration and reattach it to the
player because oh good ole networking and
good ole shenanigans, you know.
The gun can come before the player, armour
and so with disconnect, connect, disconnect,
connect so everything’s all nicely set up
and in between that, there’s this thing
that’s supposed to set the view mode for
items.
So if you have a third person you show the
third person geometry, if you’re in the
first person you show the first person geometry.
Obviously you don’t want to see the first
person geometry when in third because it’s
high polys and extra details you don’t need
to see.
The gun for all intents and purposes will
act and play the animations exactly the same
but you kind of want a low poly… lower poly
version.
It still has high fidelity but it’s not
going to kill everyone’s FPS because you’re
using insanely detailed model.
So, the legacy item 1.0 system has this ability
to switch between first and third person,
problem is if it’s already in one of those
modes and you’re telling it to switch to
that same mode, it gets locked and it doesn’t
actually refresh.
So, if we’re in the third person mode and
we tell it to go to third person, it’s already
thinks it’s there so it’s not going to
do anything.
Or if we’re in first peron and you tell
it to go into the first person, it’s not
going to do anything, and this is kind of
an issue when you attach and detach things
cause the order of setting up stuff is just
kukoo.
It’s also why we wanted to clean up a lot
of this in Item 2.0.
So, for the item system when we attach to
a player it sets the view mode and what this
does, if the view mode has changed it does
a bunch of stuff, the first person does a
bunch of stuff, the third person…
it’ll set up the attachments and geometry
and everything all fancy dancy but like I
said if you’re already in that mode things
get wonky and they don’t attach right and
that’s what’s happening to these item
port scopes.
So, the trick is, let’s see, let’s go
back to the item view.
We have this function and the FPS guys basically
added this bull which allows you to basically
brute force into that mode and if you set
this to true it’ll basically determine the
current mode that it’s in and force it.
So all we have to do is call that function,
set this to true, by the false set it to false.
It’s only an issue when you attach and reattach
things so we only need to force the mode when
we attach it back which should be rare as
in it should only happen once in awhile.
Not every single frame.
So we’ll hit magical recode, all right so
recode is finished and we’re back in the
level.
So let’s kill ourselves again.
Oh recode’s not done yet…
there it goes, recodes done, aha.
So we kill ourselves…
respawn and wham we have our attachments.
Let’s try it a few times cause that’s
always fun.
I love that ragdoll, it spins around and dies
and turns into a ragdoll and all the funny
poses.
Let’s go down the stairs and kill ourselves,
yeah.
View snapping, best part.
So, as you can see I have all my attachments
for my guy, everything is good.
Now people go FPS and do some iron sighting.
Hope you guys enjoyed, two six!
So we had a little bug when you get your gun
out, the iron sights on the top vanish or
I should say the sights all a bunch of these
little attachments… sometimes.
The even weirder part, you go in the third
person and back to first person they all work,
so it’s like, ahhhh.
You know, trying to figure out what it was,
look at the item port code, look at the attachment
code.
All it was was the legacy item code kept the
view state during first to third person and
because of attaching/reattaching things get
disconnected and you have to rebuild when
the attachments get set and if you’re not
refreshing the state that you’re in… things
go bonkers.
So, all it was was just adding a bull to a
function and when the thing gets attached
to the player you just refresh the state,
you see your sights, see your attachment,
everything’s good.
Everyone is able to kill each other now, have
some fun, two six, getting one step closer.
All right, see you guys next time, hope you
guys enjoyed.
