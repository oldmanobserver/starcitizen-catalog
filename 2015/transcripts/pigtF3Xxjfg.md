Hi guys, welcome to 10 for the
designers. My name is Randy Bassos. I'm
a tech designer. Uh my name is Kirk Toé.
I'm a senior technical designer here at
Cloud Imperium Games. So, first of all,
we'd like to thank the subscribers for
making this show possible and for us
actually being able to like share extra
information with you guys on what we've
been doing. So, we have some questions.
We'll see if we can get them answered.
Yeah, this is uh exciting for us because
this is our first uh stab at this
particular um show and uh yeah uh but we
hope to have a lot of fun with it and uh
we're going to enjoy um this direct
interaction with the uh the subscribers
and the community. Uh this question is
from Willie Pete. Uh it's specifically
about the Jean Scout. Um so the spec
sheet has almost no information for the
Jean Scout. He's right. Um could can you
please give us some of the basics uh
such as weapon loadout, max speed, size
of components like shields, generators,
etc. Um it is built as uh a scout
explorer. What jump point size can it go
through and how is that implemented in
the ship? Uh the pictures only show the
cockpit and not any interior space. Um
what are we looking at if anything for
the interior space? Okay. So, uh quite a
few questions about uh the ship and um
we do have some of the specs uh uh
determined. Um these are um going into
what we call the white box phase. It's
the very first phase of the ship
implement implementation where we take
um the raw geometry for the ship and
then um try to do things like determine
where the thrusters go, how that's going
to um actually um make the ship handle
uh in space. Um because of our new uh
internal um and physicalized ship
components, we're determining the sizes
of those and where they can actually go
onto the ship itself as well. Uh so to
answer some of the questions um the uh
the ship is going to have uh two size
three lasers uh for sure. Um looking
into possibly putting another set of
size two lasers up on the top of the
ship to give it some extra armament. Um
there's going to be one uh medium
shield. Um it's a rather large ship uh
when um it is it is open and flying. So,
we wanted to give it some u additional
uh protection from um you know forward-
facing uh shots. Uh it's going to have
two possibly four um small power plants
and um much like the Herold is going to
have um it's going to have one uh small
jump drive. Um because it is smaller
than I believe the Endeavor um it is
going to be able to you utilize any size
jump uh size jump point. So, it can use
any jump point. Um, and uh, it won't
have any trouble using any of the jump
points in the uh, in the PU. Uh, its top
speed is going to be 270 uh, meters/s.
This is as opposed to the Hornets's 200
m/ second. So, it's going to be a very
fast maneuverable ship. Um, there is no
interior space plan. Um, so much like
the Hornet, it's going to be a um a
fighter type of um spacecraft and so
there's no internal um uh internal space
that is planned for the ship itself. So
I hope that answers the questions about
the the
scout
solless regarding modularity of the
Caterpillar. Some elements of the design
like the repair and salvage shop for
example seems to need external access to
outer space. Others like the crew module
would ideally not have that exposure.
Will there be limitations on what order
the modules can be assembled in order to
have the correct access to the air lock
and the forward module or will these
have modular units have their own
external airlocks so that they can be
assembled without order restrictions? So
talking with a lot of the designers
we've kind of discussed that like each
module is going to be designed with a
thought that it'll need to be interfaced
with all the other modules around it.
And basically, so some of the modules
will have the extra air lock. Um, some
of them are going to have will directly
open up to the outside like we talked
about like the clam shells kind of just
open up a little bit so that way um
things can be like set up like the ramp.
Mhm. I think you helped me out I think
with some of the the modules kind of
looking how they would kind of fit in
with the other ones. Sure.
Um, so like we played around with the
concept of like the side opening, the
whole side being turned into a ramp. And
so there's going to be some
restrictions. Um, like the for instance,
the front module is going to have it set
up to where only the front module can be
changed out with front modules and then
the other modules are all basically the
same modules that can go in there and
then um the players can basically just
make their choice of what modules are
there. Sure. But it seems like it's
going to be less of like a a Lego type
of system and more of a these are the uh
particular module types that can go into
this bay of the the ship itself. Yeah.
And that's one of the things we played
with like we had some ideas of making a
restriction where we had some other
ideas where like you know what if the
player just wants to put in all
personnel modules let them you know and
then kind of so we're still up in the
air about whether we're going to let
them just do whatever they want or set
it to be pure restrictions. So, it kind
of answers the question, but we're still
thinking about it and we have a lot of
modules planned. So, so beer for the
beer god um nice name um asked um at
what stage of development is thruster
placement, thruster power, mass
distribution and other elements related
to flight integrated? Um how far along
the process does a ship go before it or
effects of the ship is flown for the
first time? Um dead weight responded
with good question. Uh, how will ships
like the Jean Scout um which is all
thrusters handle against a ship like the
Cutless, which is um which has fewer but
more powerful thrusters? Is there a
blank ship that can um have variable
mass and variable thrusters thrown all
about it um to take a dry run of the
ship before the uh design is finalized?
This is a great question. Um so um Randy
uh is also uh involved in implementing
uh ships and so he has some experience
in this as well. But uh our flight
system um uses the the mass and the
actual u physics of physics bounds of
the ship uh along with its center of
mass to determine um what its flight
characteristics are. um our thruster
placement and um the thruster um the
output of the thrusters um what uh
angles of attack the thrusters can
actually influence um and other
variables like our turning speed um for
the or like the actual spinning speed of
the ship um are variables that we can
all play with. Um but to the uh the end
result of all this is that we can take a
cube and make it fly um and we can place
thrusters on it um how we want um and um
fortunately we don't have to get to that
step. Typically we do have uh the the
white box model that we can take as a
reference. Um we physicalize it. So we
put actual um uh geometry that
determines its physical bounds and then
we um position the thrusters um based on
the concept and see how it actually
flies. Um we can do things like take um
uh actually nudge the actual uh
thrusters themselves so that they can
influence the the mass of the ship
better. Um but all this stuff is is
possible without having uh any finalized
geometry. So, um, we can actually figure
out what the ship is going to fly like
before having something that's anywhere
close to final. Um, and so that helps a
lot in determining what the ship's
flight characteristics is going to be.
What was what's been your experience
with that? Um, so Catacle that I've been
working on, you helped me out with the
we're looking at the thruster placement
on that and then trying to get it and
one of the things that we had issues
with was it's the asymmetric of it
asymmetricalness. Mhm. So the asymmetry
of it basically when we had placed the
original thrusters like that thing was
just like flying all over the place and
it was like so hard to control. Right.
And then so like we were trying you were
helping me like trying to like adjust
some of the things. So Right. And
something uh that Randy uh discussed
with me earlier was that uh the mass
distribution does take does play an
important part in the flight
characteristics of a ship. And so
asymmetrical ships with mass that is um
that aren't that isn't quite um balanced
makes it a challenge to to have uh the
ship fly straight um and in a way that
you kind of need the ship to fly uh the
ship to fly so that you can actually um
make it do what you want to do in space.
the the ballast also like the ballast
controls and everything that we were
trying to like start getting on board
and online like that would with the
asymmetrical ships like that would help
out big time. Even the regular ships
like once the ballast gameplay and
everything gets in stuff. So like if
you're using so much ammo then the ammo
goes away ballast like filling in for
that and adjusting to where it needs or
whatever. Yep. We'll eventually uh be
able to do things like uh put ballast in
places of the ship. Here's a secret. Uh
the um the uh Vandal ships are
completely faked as far as the their
their balance because the wings um are
so large that they make the flight
characteristics difficult to balance.
And so cheated a little bit on the
wings. Um and uh this is especially true
in the case of the um the scythe. uh
because of its its large right wing and
it's rather minuscule left wing uh we
needed to uh kind of cheat the system so
that uh the the uh the flight model
thinks that u both of them weigh the
same therefore it'll find a straight
line otherwise it would just be this
this crazy thing that you could not
control and so um but you know rest
assured we're using real physics um to
actually make the ships fly in space
can the command module we're talking
about the caterpillar reattach in the
field space or will we need to somehow
get the main body towed back to port.
So, um the command module is actually
being designed as like a kind of escape
pod or like a quick getaway and it's
going to have limited um QT
capabilities. It's going to be able to
dock and redock with the main hole of
the ship.
So, the reason why to undock or to
redock is basically up to the crew. And
one of the ideas I had was basically to
hit like a baton pass with the main hole
of the ship. And we had discussed this
um earlier about like um you gave me the
example of like the 18-wheeler. Do you
want to explain?
Well, it's actually yours. Why don't you
just explain cuz cuz it's it's it's a
great analogy and I think I think it
really um it really illustrates how this
whole mechanical work. Yeah. So
basically taking like a 18-wheeler ship,
right? or 18-wheeler today and it has
like the main cabin that drives the
engine and then you have the actual like
the back part the rear part of it. So
basically just detaching that main cabin
part and then having popping up the
18-wheeler part or the rear another one
can just pop right in. So you can play
like potato with it kind of like
all right well now I'm controlling it
I'm taking it in this leg of the journey
I'm taking it this leg of the journey
and stuff even swapping cargo or
whatever like just the different it
works within the different variants but
the gameplay is still pending so we'll
see how all that works cuz you had
mentioned like all the security stuff
that need to be done. Yeah, I think uh
something we need to to think about is
uh because you can hot swap these these
command modules, we want to put in some
kind of security measures so that um you
couldn't just pirate one away uh without
at least a little bit of effort. Um and
um so, you know, we're we're actively
discussing these types of things and uh
hopefully we'll have these systems
online when the when the ship is
actually available to
fly. Okay. Uh, next question comes from
Zodiac Medicay. Um, another cool name.
Um, is it difficult to do hanger ready
designs for concepts that are not fully
fleshed out yet? Uh, I would constantly
second guess myself with interface
design on stuff like ew consoles. Yes
and no. Um while it is difficult to
design um interfaces for uh components
um that haven't been fleshed out yet um
the the happy answer for us is that we
don't need to. Um so what what we do is
we determine the um the actual uh
physical sizes of the screens that are
going to serve as the bed for the uh the
actual interaction. Um then the team
that is responsible for doing this
interaction such as ew or other things
such as uh ship power management um in
any of the stations that we have um they
they get to work actually designing out
the systems and interface along with the
UI team for how that's going to work. We
basically have a big blank canvas that
we just need to position um and make
useful within the ship. So that part of
it is rather easy. We designed the space
so that the player can um take that
station and then um the magic of the
design system once it comes online uh
simply shows up on that screen and the
player is able to interact with that. So
um kind of roundabout answer to your
question, but I hope that that serves to
describe how we do um our ship interior
design when we're in the white box
phase. Yeah, I mean the two ships that
I've worked on that I'm working on so
far was like, you know, the Star Liner,
which had a whole another host of just
interior designs and layouts that we
went through, like all those iterations
and which you guys should have already
hopefully seen. Um, and then hopefully
next I'll be able to actually show them
all the interior layouts and designs for
the Caterpillar cuz right all the all
the interiors are crazy and making sure
that they fit within the FPS metrics and
then making sure that they are fitting
for like the hull of the ship, the
exterior and making sure it just matches
with the ship itself. Just it is a blank
canvas. It sometimes gets a little
overwhelming because especially at start
like starting you're like what what what
can I do with this? Right? But you know
uh so you know there's there's going to
be systems that we haven't designed yet
um because of the the particular type of
uh responsibility that the caliper is
going to have. But we know that we need
to make a station for uh doing um say
the cargo management. Um we know that we
have a 16x9 space that we need to fill
the screen with um when the player is
man at that station. So, we designed
that space um and um when the uh that
particular uh gameplay um is flushed out
with this UI, it'll just magically
overlay onto that space that we've
already set aside for that particular
mechanic. Yeah. Well, some of the stuff
we've already talked about with like
multi crew and everything and then
working with the designers in UK,
working with like Zay and everything for
um just all the different screens, the
seats, the functions of those seats,
what each one kind of does, like all
that stuff's really starting to come on
board. So hopefully when you guys
actually get to play with more of the
multicrew stuff, then you'll be able to
see a lot more of the designs actually
come alive and stuff like that and we
can keep kind of just pushing the
envelope of what we want for the
intention of what like Star Citizen is,
you know? Right. Good plug. When I when
I say UI, I really mean Zane.
I have a question from um beer for the
beer god as well. Both the Herald and
Caterpillar advertise as being intended
for various pirate purposes. A common
example is the Herald jamming signals
while the Caterpillar with Cutless
Export does the dirty work. How do both
of you how do both of you envision
piracy to work within Star Citizen? And
how have you designed the Herod and
Caterpillar in accordance with that
understanding? The Caterpillar in
particular was always designed as a
search and rescue, right? Then the other
variants when they were starting to be
designed and concepted, that's when it
was taken to like, oh, well, it could do
this, it could do this, and it was
always kind of designed to support and
work in tandem with the other um Drake
ships. So, it kind of started with that.
So basically talking with a lot of the
other designers and seeing what they
were because like um I think you and
Sherman were actually working on the
Herald for a bit. Yep. As far as the
internal components and whatnot. Yeah.
So then like I got a chance to look at
the look at that look at the components
they're doing and then look at the
intent of that and then kind of just
build in stuff right to Caterpillar to
kind of work with those guys. So, can't
really talk about too much gameplay yet
because it's still being designed and
whenever when I'm actually able to show
them the actual interior spaces and talk
about more of the Caterpillar designs,
then I'll be able to get more
information. But yeah, they are built
with the intention to support one
another. Um, and like the example I gave
you earlier was like I really see the
Herold running close support and being
really close to like the caterpillar
where the caterpillar is kind of being
like the main the main person of the
formation and then having like cutlesses
kind of sim around them, right? and like
just being like support and dropping in
and taking out. So that way they can do
like they can do the quick um dash and
grabs and stuff like that and then store
it right on the on the caterpillar as
well as kind of blanket the area for
like just eore stuff, right? And piracy
seems to be a very popular topic. Um and
uh truth is we're still ironing out a
lot of the details. Uh but rest assured
whenever we um we're designing any
systems for these ships uh because of
how um pirate ccentric this ship is uh
that's always um at the forefront of any
of the designs that we implement for the
ship. Um okay, next question is from
Mount OG
Bogei. Okay. There seems to be a
disparity in ship weights compared to
what's represented in the model and XML
values etc. a ship that is big on the
exterior but is mostly on the inside but
weighs as much as it looks like from the
outside um and ships that are smaller
and ted to have armor obviously solid or
densely packed that weigh less than
slightly bigger hollow ships. Is there
going to be a standard metric to
determining the ship weights based on
the volume the ship takes up and the
possible list of materials the ship
would be made out of? Great question. Um
and I'm gonna be honest with you all. Um
this is all currently a guess. So all of
our ship masses at the moment are rough
estimates based on the um typically the
the general bounds of that the ship
takes up. So it's volume um the we don't
currently have solid metrics for um the
actual physical space um and therefore
the mass um would would be represented
in the ship. Um there's also
um material densities that we have we
haven't quite figured out yet. Um that
is coming down the pike. Um but until
then we it's kind of all eyeballed. So
hopefully in the future we'll be able to
get uh more more concrete metrics for
all of these um all these masses and
densities and whatnot to determine more
realistic uh values of ships. Um this
will be especially important when uh
ballast and especially cargo come
online. So cargo itself is going to be a
um they're obviously going to take up
space and mass and they will change the
characteristics the flight
characteristic of ships when you are
laden with um a bunch of cargo
especially on ships that can take on a
bunch like you know massive amounts such
as the constellation huge huge cargo bay
when it's full of um really massive uh
boxes of stuff the flight
characteristics going to change. How
will they change? That's that's what
we're terming now. So, um that will come
someday soon. Um and when we figure that
out, um I think we'll have a little bit
more um uh realistic values for all the
masses of our one of the one of the
things like you mentioned the
constellation. And one of the things is
whenever we get cargo up and running and
then that adds extra weight mass the
center of mass changes on the ships. So
the thrusters will have to be smart
enough to adjust you know. And then
again going back to asymmetrical ships
like my Caterpillar like um we had
talked all that cargo will be in the
front of the ship and then all the
weight for like fuel and everything else
will be in the back of the ship. So when
it's empty the center of mass is
actually closer to engineering but then
when all the cargo is there then the
mass changes by like like a good almost
10 meters. Sure. It changes. So it's
going to be interesting once we get that
on board. Sure. Sure. And once all this
stuff is working, uh it will uh help
incentivize us to better design uh
interchangeable thrusters so that hey,
maybe you do need um like uh thrusters
that have slightly slower attack but are
able to move more mass efficiently,
especially across the uh uh you know
long long stretches of space. That will
um encompass the PU gameplay for for
moving tons of cargo. Yeah, cargo is
going to be very encompassing for all
the stuff we have like with mining and
salvaging and repair and all that stuff.
Yep. Cool. So, I have a question that
actually multiple people asked. Can the
Caterpillar stretch or contract with
more or less modules? So, as of right
now, the design is to not stretch. It's
not going to be like one of the whole
series. It's basically going to be the
modules um the modules will fit within
there. So, like right now I think six
modules. So like the front module and
then like five other ones and then the
players can basically just swap whatever
they want based on whatever their needs
and based on what they want the ship to
do. Yeah. So I think the this again
going back to that Lego uh analogy um
that system I think it just causes too
much uh too much havoc. you could have,
you know, might let you make just a
single module ship or a thousand module
ship and it's not something that we
really um want to plan around. So, I
would hate to put like a thousand
thrusters. Yes. I think I think start
starting off with with a with a
determined uh number of modules is is
going to be um uh resultant in the best
um working ship that we can deliver.
Definitely agree on that one. So yeah,
hopefully once we release more
information on the catapult, we can
actually let you guys know all the
different module variants and stuff that
we could that you could play with. My
final question, um, Skiffy writes, uh,
with many citizens opening owning
multiple ships, I'm curious if it would
be possible to staff spare ships
entirely by NPCs. For example, if I'd
like to pilot my Carrick to go
exploring, but send my research back to
have NPCs on the Endeavor start
crunching, plus send coordinates I
discovered back to my claimer, who could
start basic salvage operations, or to a
lesser extent, could I simply send
coordinates to my ship's NPCs who could
get them staged for my arrival? A lot of
ships in that question. Um, there was a
response from Wilborg 1978. Um, I have
similar questions of that. If I run as a
player in a Carrick with an uh on all
NPC crew, um can I hire additional NPCs
to escort my Carrick with a Starfare and
or Vanguard? Or is it ship size for
escorts limited so that only little
ships like a Herald, Hornet, and so on
can be used for escorts? Is it possible
as a solo solo player to play the
Carrick with an NPC crew and put an NPC
on the Endeavor so I can transfer uh the
found stuff from my character or is it
imposs impossible for a solo player?
These are all great questions and the
happy answer is yes. We plan for um the
NPCs to completely man a ship that you
own um or multiple ships. They'll it'll
work just like the contract system for
uh a human player that um is going to be
flying your ship um but they'll simply
be NPCs. And so how does that how does
that work though with like if I'm in one
ship though and then just the NPC
captain cuz like how the seats are
broken down with everything. Sure. Well,
uh when when we get the NPCs to work, um
you you'll actually give them contracts
and so you're telling them what to do
with the ship. So if this if the command
is um I'm transferring my cargo to the
ship that is owned by me um and I want
you to take it back to our hanger or
base or whatever um and sell it. Um that
is something that is uh planned to
happen. And so, um, you don't need to
babysit all of the, um, the standard
activities that a ship that you own can
can handle, so long as you have NPCs
that can, um, handle all the stations on
that ship. Um, and so I think that'll be
a lot of fun because risky though. Sure.
But you know with that um it lets you um
take uh give some of the
responsibilities for the stuff that you
need to get done but may not want to sit
um you know on the ship itself awaiting
it uh its uh function to go do. So if
it's a if it's a lesser task um and I
have a ship to do that why not let why
not let me do that? So, it's going to be
I think uh I'd love to have a fleet. I'd
love to have a fleet of ships, but at
the same time, it's like do I want to
bring my whole fleet out because if I
get attacked, I can only do so much.
It's like that's a throw risk, right?
Right. And that's that's the decision
you make. And so, I think that's where
the fun comes because you figure out
what works best for you and what you
want to um allow these NPCs to handle.
Um and uh you know, with experience um
uh as time goes on, I think people will
figure out what works optimally for
them. So, um, I would just get like 10
hornets then and just have my one ship
then I have like 10 hornet escorts if
anything comes in they're not messing
with me. All right. Or I might wait for
you outside your hanger and as soon as
you you put you send your ship and I'm
attacking and taking everything you got.
So, yeah. So, that'll be fun. Cool. So,
last question is actually from
Deadweight. Um, a question about the
design process itself in regards to
heavily modular ships like the
Caterpillar Endeavor and whole series.
How do you go about sketching out the
game mechanics that revolve around the
modules themselves? Do you all sit
around a conference room throwing out
around ideas to see what might and might
not work? Are there any balance
considerations with ships that can
effectively change the entire makeup
from heavy combat to almost to mostly
harmless or from repair and medical to
pure hauling? Or do you just let mass
and power limitations govern what
players can and can't do? We do actually
design each module out for purpose. We
do sometimes sit around in a conference
room and we also do have a lot of design
considerations that we put into it and
sometimes we have the power limitations
govern what the design is based on just
whether it's OP, whether it's
functional, whether it's so like the
main thing is like each ship is
completely different. In the case of the
Caterpillar, like we looked a lot into
what it was intended to do. So like you
know the original intent was search and
rescue and then we started looking at
some of the other ones like the other
variants which you know we were like the
possibility of variants were the marine
the merchant marine and then the small
scale salvage. So we started looking at,
okay, well, what does a search and
rescue need, right? So search and
rescue, you need like a medical bay. So
boom, we got a medical bay check. We
need a place to house the crew as well
as the medical crew. So bam, now that's
like an extra personnel one right there.
And then, you know, you need cargo just
in case. You also need launch bays so
that way you can get people launched out
to go save people and stuff, you know,
like it's like kind of like this like
the dive rescues, right? Sure. I think
what you're describing is like the whole
top down approach though you first the
ship function itself is determined and
then once we determine the particular
type of function then we design the
module so that it'll serve that function
and what um those needs are for that
particular module. And so, um, we keep
diving down deeper to try to figure out,
um, you know, because for us as
designers, we're determining what the
player interaction with the ships are.
And therefore to uh accomplish those
particular tasks that the ship is suited
for, what works best as far as uh the
components, in this case, the modules uh
on that ship. The important thing is
also feasibility. Like because we had
some I made a couple modules or designed
inspect some couple modules and people
were like I don't know if that would
work or they needed we need to tone that
down a little bit just to make sure it
wasn't you know crazy over overpowered.
Yeah. But can you talk about some of the
examples of the ones that have been
designed out so far? Um so yeah. Yeah.
Like we have like the medical bay and we
have the cargo bay. We have some of the
personnel bays and we have multiple
variants um even different of the
different modules themselves. So like we
have two different cargo modules, right?
So what are the differences in those? So
like one of the cargo ones we have is
where one has like a catwalk. So that
way people you lose about like 15 to 20
SCU I think with a catwalk. But then
it's basically it's a catwalk. So you
can actually go through and walk through
the cargo and get through the entire
ship cuz if you fill up an entire bay of
cargo then you can't walk through it. So
if you wanted to get to the other side
of the ship, basically you either have
to like exit the ship to go back in
through a different docking port and
something like that. So the player can
set up the ship however they want. And
based on what modules they choose for
their ship, they have to deal with the
consequences of okay, this is what's
this is what this one has the strengths.
This is what the weaknesses of this one
and this module does this. That's good.
Uh so that there's um there are
positives and negatives to each type and
then the player is able to determine
what works best for them. you know, one
of the ones we're playing with. So,
like, um, everybody's always talking
about like the pirate stuff. So, we're
talking about like, you know, some more
attack, more aggressive type modules to
add to it. And also the ones like people
are like, "Oh, it's useless." But cargo
is kind of, you know, still has like
still has hard points on it. So, like
each side of the bay has like tractor
beam hard points, right? Like size ones.
So, if you wanted to, you could put swap
those tractor bum beams out for like two
size ones, right? Ship. So you can kind
of like I wouldn't I know I I keep the
tractor beans but you never know people
want to put like you know guns on the
bay cargo bay. Let them do it. Have fun.
Good luck. If you can come up you guys
come up with other ways to use this
stuff. Awesome. Cuz emergent gameplay is
something that we're really trying to
just let them have the toy and then let
them see what they do with it. Cool. So
cool. Um I think that's our 10
questions. Yeah, I think that's it. Uh
