## Transcript

hey everyone welcome back to an all new
exciting episode of bug Smashers uh
before we
begin you know what's happening this
week is going to have an awesome new
sequel I know I've been waiting a while
for it I know you guys have been too
it's going to be some amazing stuff
coming up this Friday oh yeah some
family drama some action a little bit of
Darkness probably but you know what
we've been waiting this for a while I'm
I'm ready for that emotional road trip
are you cuz I know I'm ready for those
little chipmunks oh yeah you know what
I'm talking about Alvin and the
Chipmunks for the road trip oh oh we got
it oh hope you guys see it let's
begin bug
[Music]
bishes hey everyone I'm here to show you
some bugs that we have fixed for 2.0
thanks to you guys submitting those
awesome bug reports so I have couple
bugs here I'm going to show you um what
they were and how they were fixed so
this guy is um the Quantum Drive um I'm
sure you guys have seen the video if not
um there's a video going around where uh
some guy was in I think it was a
constellation and there was a space
station and he was right here he spooled
up his Quantum Drive went into the
station and then it de um spooled and
then now he was stuck inside and it was
kind of like wigg wiling around cuzz
physics was like oh my God I'm
penetrating an object and then he slowly
got released out so um Craig in the UK
he wrote uh the quantum drive system so
he was like hm that's not right what's
going on so um apparently um the code
that he's written and he actually did
this fix uh he would actually do a trace
to make sure that you're not doing uh
you're not you're not going to hit
anything but there was a moment in a
time when uh it was called the spooling
up phase that he wouldn't actually do a
ray trace and it was during that time
since it didn't do a trace it allowed
you to for a moment go into that object
until it went oh my God you're in
something abort but by then it was too
late so what Craig did is he basically
added a ray Trace in the spool up phase
so if you try to spool up and there's an
object in the way it's going to be like
whoa whoa whoa no
and he also um increased the maximum Ray
casting so that it's based before it was
based on your maximum speed but for
sanity and safety checks he also
increased um it based on I think he said
yeah right here 3.5 km so it will do an
extra check even if your ship is a
little bit slow just to make sure that
you're not going to penetrate an object
so go Craig all right next one save this
bad boy
[Music]
should I keep going all right I got a
moment so uh this next crash is our
local data store um this is basically
our code that was written by uh Paul
where it figures out all the items that
you currently have from like your hanger
when you move stuff around and then when
you join a game this bad boy will
basically go okay you have all these
items spawn them stuff and then if your
ship dies it will actually hit this um
little block and it tries to clean up
all the items so if you spawned in with
a hornet with a couple Gatling guns and
the ship dies at the moment it it will
remove all those items so they're not
just left into the world and
unfortunately there was a small U boo
boo where you heard me right Boo Boo
where uh this list would actually erase
the item and then access it so we would
delete the item and then access and then
crash um
unfortunately that sucks so um what Rob
Johnson UK did was like hm that should
not happen we should access it then
delete so that was the simple fix and
now when we delete items it won't crash
the server
randomly all
right and we have another fix by um Rob
Johnson and this is deals with the man
turrets or the constellation turrets or
the uh Retaliator turrets uh when you
get inside you'll notice sometimes on
certain angles uh your ship will rotate
or or I'm sorry not your ship your
turret will rotate a little bit weird
that's because of this little math right
here where
um it was believed at the time that we
would rotate from 0 to 360 but in
reality we're actually doing um 180
negative 180 so if this little code was
the original 360 we were trying to say
all right if we're here snap the CH
instantly this way instead of doing full
rotation since we're just um doing a
little bit of turn but because we're
doing 180 to 180 this little bit of code
will actually cause some bad Jitter
and since we're doing a little bit you
know 180 difference um we have to do a
different trick and that's what Rob did
here so instead of you know going back
to zero we just if we're on this side
but the goal's here we don't want to go
all the way this way we want to go back
here so we do a little bit of math to
say all right if we're here but the
goals here just go this and so it's a
nice little smooth
blend so that one's done next one
one all right so we have um this vehicle
destruction and what happens is when you
die um you know by hitting alt backspace
um it causes an explosion and basically
your ship goes into
bits we'll do it in increments and then
edit
[Laughter]
it I think there's going to be moments
when he stops look
just comment on it yeah and so Dam and
so what happens is um because we're a
random um explosion type The Shield is
actually taking the explosion absorbing
it and not actually causing damage to
the ship which I thought was pretty
funny so um what I had to do was set the
damage type to vehicle destruction so
that the vehicle code knows that when
this happens we're destroying the
vehicle and do not do anything to the
shield and then for another sanity check
um this little bit of code will say
should I process the shield well if I'm
Splash damaged which is explosive radius
damage and I am not the vehicle
destruction do not do a shield unless
I'm a direct hit to the shield so now
when I do self-destruct the The Shield
won't absorb anything and the vehicle
will just
go as expected uh that was a little
funny boo boo uh because um I think it
was on the cutless black uh the
designers increased the shields quite a
bit and it just absorbed all of the
destruction damage I thought that was a
little fun um and there you have it all
right so hope you guys enjoyed this
week's episode of Bug
Smasher just do it all right
no hope you guys enjoyed this week's
episode of bug Smashers I'm sorry for
the noise as you can tell we're doing
construction still in the new office um
we're still smashing those bugs for
2.0 uh thanks to you guys you know
submitting those bugs we've been trying
to pick out which ones hurt your play
experience you know crashes or maybe
someone's exploiting you know trying to
narrow down what makes the game unfun to
make it fun um hope you guys enjoyed and
in case you guys can't see you know that
awesome movie album in the
Chipmunks well as Harry Potter once said
May the force be with
you this video made possible by the ICC
Stellar surveyors and subscribers like
