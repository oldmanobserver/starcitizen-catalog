## Transcript

hey everyone welcome back to another
episode of bug Smashers U before we
begin I have some good
news hey everyone welcome back to
another episode of bug Smashers um
before we begin I got some good news I'm
want to let you guys know that in this
election I'm going to be running for a
president of the United States you know
I smashed the bugs in the games and I
think it's time to smash the bugs in
Congress we got it we got it
bux
[Music]
bashes hey everyone we are here in my
fun little test level again and we got a
bug um that the
thrusters on these little guys and the
turrets aren't
working and so what I'm going to do is I
created a little flow graph I can show
you
guys got to move this over um whenever
the AI pops in I put him directly into
the seat and there's our little AI guy
right here so when we hop in the game he
should sit down so then he'll
automatically use the turret but since
there's no enemies around the turret
won't move so what I'm going to do is go
in the fancy Dancy code comment out the
uh some the code that calculates where
the vehicle TCH look because we want to
do some debug and we're going to
manually set the goal
to always move just so we could debug
this that way we could see if it's a
gameplay issue or a something deeper so
let's get the current
angle and we'll add it by I know say an
arbitrary speed of
10
radians a
second I can't hit space cuz it's too
early in the morning there we
go and so we're going to update the Y to
go 10
seconds around or 10 um not 10 seconds
10 radians around so let's tell recode
to do its
thing and if all one well this thing
should start rotating around wait for
recode wait for
recode come on recode there go so recode
popped up and we're gonna hop in the
game and as you can see it's h asn't
moving and our gu
inside that's not good so lucky for you
guys I was able to debug this problem
and track it down to this bit of code
before we get to there let's see what
the turret's actually doing so the
turret in this block of code is trying
to find a new angle to where the turret
should move to and if it finds
that it updates the angle and and in
this bit of code it will try
to figure out where it should move so
it's going to go all right here's where
I'm going to
go um based on the speed of the turret
so the goal could be here and the turret
could be here but um maybe it only moves
so slowly or so fast and that's what
this bit does so it sets the
current um goal or current angles to
snap to now
all right so and this is the final bit
of code that actually takes the angle um
puts it in querian and then writes that
information directly into the bone so we
have the virtual angle and now we tell
the bone the snap here and we tell the
skeleton information to snap to this
rotation um it's called postprocess qu
uh set postprocess quat because after
the thing has done animating if it has
animations then we do the rotation
and this bit of code makes sure that we
actually do an update for at least one
frame so even if we're not animating we
want the skeleton to update that bone
position at least for a
frame and that's what these two lovely
functions do and we eventually get to
here the skeleton um process um so this
will get called whenever we have
animations or if we're doing an update
so in this this case since we're doing a
um force update for one
frame this little bull will be true so
the only other thing is um this will
never be true so we'll never actually
get into this block where we'll actually
take our joint information which we have
set um right here in the
postprocess that's um basically this
part right here and it never gets to
this block so you never see the turret
running because when we did an
integration somehow this got mangled in
where it's looking for facial
morphs and if it doesn't have it it
won't run this bit of code and since
obviously our turret's not going to have
facial morphs we need this bit of code
to run at least of this part but this
section we don't need so what I'm going
to do is format this a little
bit uh so if we have an animation
playing or if we're
forced then we will
do um let's see we want to
do an
update we'll do has
update so if we have a forced
update oops we want
zero then we write directly to the Bone
and if we have facial
information there we
go then we'll also
update so now this split of code works
if we set um the post um quum
or if there's facial information and
then it will make sure to update if we
have either one of these when we get
into this block so
hopefully I have no compile errors and
once recode kicks
in you should see the turret start
spinning so let's wait for that turet oh
there it goes so now we have it so we
set the information um now the turret
sends it to the skeleton the skeleton
will do the proper update and this will
also fix the the turrets that we have on
the
bottom
voila rotate and let's remove our debug
code because we don't want to commit
this and there we go now we're all set
for
commit and the whole thing rotates
turrets rotate and everything yay as you
guys saw we had a little bit of an
integration problem we hit a few of
those once in a while and in this case
um some new facial morphing stuff for
the skeleton managed to mangle some old
logic that allowed us to rotate Bones on
demand uh it took a little bit to track
down but once we had a little debug way
of testing the turrets and all that fun
uh I was able to track it down get it to
go and as you saw everything works just
as good hope you guys like that and
remember vote for me
