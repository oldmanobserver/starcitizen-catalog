## Transcript

hey everyone welcome back to another
episode of bug Smashers uh got some good
news I got myself a whole brand new
office it's pretty nice here in the
corner as he pans around looks at my
awesome
monitors oh yeah and I got my free pack
of gum my ammo and my disco Lando
signature
bug
[Music]
bashes hey everyone so we are here in
our
fabulous little test level and I have ai
ship and I'm going to go into AI physics
mode and we should be seeing some
Thruster effects but we're not so I'm
going to turn on these little uh Debo
command to force thr to turn on since
our AI is not flying and the bug that we
have is not only is our main engine not
working but if we move this guy far away
and
back move him far away and we'll just
teleport to him you'll notice that all
the um engines have stopped working but
if I look at them a certain way they
kind of turn on and the problem gets
worse and worse the further away I am
from the z00
origin so what's happening well
unfortunately these
particles um are having a fun time
because we go into our code right here
uh this bit determines whether or not we
should see the thing and it's trying to
figure out you know how close we the
camera is
to uh the center of the ship however
this bit of fun little code is actually
taking the camera position and doing the
difference between the origin of the
level and this is because of the way
that this code is treating our Zone
space code um these sections of the code
are in World space and when we're
telling it to get this um
transformation we're that's we're taking
a world space um bound
getting a world space Matrix and trying
to compute a world space AB out of that
we're getting some weird numbers because
you're supposed to for this function
pass in the world transformation matrix
and a local space and it will trans it
will make a world space transform or B
bounding box but if we're pass in a
world space one we're going to get some
weird stuff as you can see
here
so going back into the code um have to
clean up uh pretty much this bit so if I
undo these
fixes or undo the Break um I changed the
code here it used to create a um
transformation based on the um world
bounding box but what I have done is our
Nifty little zone system I just said hey
give me your current world space
position because the zone system
automatically figures that stuff out you
know if I'm in a Zone within a Zone
within a Zone this will tell me the
world space calculation so why do all
that necessary work when we could just
ask the zone system and now we could get
the correct distance from the camera and
make sure that we are you know in fact
from the camera to the vehicle and not
from the camera to the center of the map
and I actually had to do some more
Cleanup in some other
areas as you can
see uh this was a little clean up
because it was uh uh this was a fun one
um so when I was cleaning this up before
I found this little bit and since this
is a world Matrix and this is a local it
was basically downcasting and we were
losing Precision so I had to undo that
and make sure that we pass in the full
world
transformation then
finally uh this bit of code is where we
pass in the information where we are
into the zone so if we go back to the
broken code if you notice here we're
taking the world space and telling the
zone system that we're sending you a
Zone space
transformation which is completely wrong
so we're giving it World coordinates and
treating it like we're in a local or
Zone space
so had to clean that up and now we say
all
right um here's our normal
transformation and we're going to update
this into Zone space because this
actually is Zone space uh these two
functions here will actually take the
world um this will take the world bounds
and actually move it into the local or
Zone space and the same thing goes
for this function it will Bas this is
basically in zone space or local
space so now with those two changes we
are updating correctly and making sure
that you know we're updating the Zone
into the Zone the world into the
world when we come back into here and we
grab our world absolute bounds we should
be
good so let's give that a
compile and to as this goes on um you
can think of this little piece of paper
in this whole room its coordinates in
this 0 is in World space and its bounds
could be the this whole big box and this
is all in World space but say do I have
a pen I have a pen I draw a little thing
right
here this is now in local space or Zone
space of this little object
and if we want to get this position in
World space we have to compute the
location of it relative to this object
and then U from that we could compute
where it is in the world but if we
compute its World space against its
World space we're going to get some
weird number like we're seeing here so
we have to go local then to
world so let's see what happens when we
load up the map
all right so we are back in the test
level and let's turn on AI
physics let's turn on our fancy
Dancy I copied and pasted the wrong
thing turn on my fancy Dancy debug
console variable that will force the
Thruster effects to
Fire and we'll move the vehicle way out
into Oblivion and we'll teleport to himo
as you can see the thrusters are still
on including the back
Thruster and there we have it now the
particles are actually checking the
distance between you know the eye and
the Thruster or the where the particle
origin is instead of the particle um I'm
sorry the eye to the origin of the
map and there we have it we now have
pretty particles working again
yay teach me how to
particle all right so as you guys saw we
had a fun little um issue with our
particles where they were not taking in
count the Zone space and they were in
fact taking in account the world space
when it tried to compute where it was in
World space so we took our world space
and said hey we're going to compute our
position in World space and it just
messed up um our calculations instead it
should have said all right here's my
zone space now we're going to transform
to World space and then here's our
particle and with that we were able to
say hey here's the camera to the
particle position yep we could see it
show it instead of hey here's the the
position of the eyes to the origin of
the map yeah that thing's far away even
though it's right here so that was fixed
up and now we can see our pretty little
particles in the world and even inside
of the ships so hope you guys enjoyed
till next
