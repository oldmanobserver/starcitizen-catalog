There's no more coffee. The coffee is
gone. Tom, why is there no coffee? I
need
coffee.
Coffee. Now for
Miami. Bug
smashes. Hey everyone. Uh we're here in
a fun little test level with an upside
down buggy. Uh, the reason is because if
I move this little image here from
QA, when the buggy dies, apparently its
wheels detach from the the buggy. So,
and it looks a little funky. So, let's
test that right now. Hop into the
game. Take a little
lag and let's kill the
[Laughter]
buggy. Ah.
We got to do that again cuz that was
awesome. All right, let's kill the
buggies. Ah, his wheels just fall
down. Oh, that's great. Oh, we have to
do it one more
time. Let's do it in slow
motion. Oh, yeah. Slow motion. Watch
those wheels fall. So real. Such
physics. All right, let's fix that. So,
oh, what's happening? Well, as our
vehicle slowly sinks down into the
Nether, uh, when a vehicle dies, that
little piece that's slowly sinking into
the ground, uh, turns into a debris
item, and all the geometry is supposed
to go with that, and then the vehicle
could die. However, what we're seeing
here is the vehicle's still sticking
around with geometry, and the little
debris piece is not getting the wheels
or the
suspension. So, let's fix that.
Uh, so prior to
this I
did quite Oh, no things popping up. You
can't see it, but I can. So many things.
All right, there we go. So, before I
came here, I had to do a little bit of
reformatting
of this little uh vehicle part. Uh
basically if I go into my little subp
part I reformatted uh this little in it
geometry so that we could swap geometry
from this particular part to a dam
damage part and I needed a way to reset
the geometry on the physics part or on
the vehicle part so that it could have
nothing there while in the breeze we
have something. So I basically
reformatted this so that I can now allow
a null geometry and I went through the
correct path. So if I have something I
load it into the correct entity slot
otherwise I free it. And then I set up
the correct transforms and particular
vehicle stuff that you would need. And
so now that we have all that fun stuff
um anytime we want to detach from the
vehicle we now want to remove our
geometry.
So, we'll do that a little bit. And now
we have the ability to remove bits from
the um the vehicle. We now got to move
that piece onto the brief piece. So, and
this little guy um I should go right
here. Where is it?
So when our part is actually going to
get detached,
uh we call this function which gathers
all the geometry from the part and any
associated extra geometry that it knows
of. Also gets all the items and any
attached geometry that we add in like
the landing gear. And as you can see
here, here it is.
If currently we only take geometry that
has um we call it a a skeleton or a CGA
where you have one piece of uh you have
the skeleton it has multiple geometry
bits and that's what this little uh what
do you call it stat object is each
little bone has these little bits of
geometry. Unfortunately the wheels and
suspension just have geometry. they
don't have these skins or these um
skeletons. They actually are just pieces
of geometry that go into that slot. So,
we have to allow support
uh for just geometry into those areas.
So, we're going to get rid of this check
to see if we have a character, which we
don't.
And we're going to run a bit of extra
code that I have right here that says,
hey, if we are um, you know, a
character, we're going to do as we did
before. But if we're not a character,
we're just some piece of geometry. We're
going to still add it to the list, but
we're going to let um the higher up part
know that we're coming from, you know,
no, not from a skeleton. So we're going
to set our bone index to negative one
saying hey we're free range geometry we
don't come from this particular
skeleton. So now that we built that list
up we got to handle the case that we are
not uh you know part of that skeleton.
So we go back down to
here and here we are. So now we go
through our list of geometry and um the
OB since we're going through each of the
bones um we're going to take all the
geometry from those parts and snap it
into the degrees piece. Um but we got to
make sure that um if this part is part
of a skeleton that and we had that ID,
we need to clean it up and we got to
make sure that we have the ID now that
we could have, you know, one So, this
will protect this area of code. And
let's see what we get
now. Building, building, building. Get
those buildings.
Building
and
action. Let's see. Wait for the recode
to pop
up. All right. So, we're back in our
fancy dancy level. Let's see what
happens when we kill the vehicle. So,
turn it
on console. Kill it. Hey, the wheels are
with it.
Yay. Let's try one more
time for
science.
Woo! All right, let's check out physics.
Oh,
no. All the fancy wheel stuff is at the
center of the debris item. So, or
physics wheels are all in the center.
All right, let's fix that real quick.
So, lucky for you, I have code prepared
for you. Um, what's happening is we're
moving this geometry into a particular
slot, but this phys physics doesn't
still thinks it's at the this particular
origin, and it doesn't have the offset
that it would that if it was on like a a
skele, you know, actual origin of the
skeleton position. So, we need to move
physics to the correct location just
like where the geometry bit is. And
that's what we're going to do here. We
only kn need to do it for uh these subp
parts because they're just those extra
geometry that don't have those
offsets. So, we're going to save this.
We're going to basically get the offset
that we already have, tell Physics about
it, and the renderer knows about it so
that we're all in happy golucky same
spot. Let's compile that. See how we
go. This guy has awesome
physics. Look at that. Oh yeah, physics.
There goes recode. So, let's kill the
vehicle one more
time.
Ha. All the wheels and suspension
physics are all the correct spot. So,
now our debris item is actual
debris.
Excellent. Woo.
Hope you guys enjoyed. Hope you guys
enjoyed the buggies bug. That thing
always loves to buggy around. Haha, pun
intended, I guess. I don't know. Hope
you guys enjoyed that bug of crazy
physics. Um, we'll have some more
probably in the future. The buggy. That
seems to be the one vehicle that always
escapes
our clutches. Well, see you guys next
time and hope you enjoyed it.
