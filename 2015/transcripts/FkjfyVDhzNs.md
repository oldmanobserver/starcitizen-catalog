hello everyone welcome to another
episode for temp for the chairman uh for
those of you who haven't watched this
before this is where I take 10 questions
from our subscribers and answer them to
the best of my ability our subscribers
are the subset of our community that
contribute money every month to support
our ongoing Community engagement uh uh
and sort of community
um relations that we do every day
essentially and you know we I think it's
one of the reasons why Star Citizen is
so successful is because we really
concentrate on trying to inform and
share uh and communicate with everybody
that is back the game and uh we we
really couldn't do it to the level we do
it without the money the subscribers
contribute because it sort of pays for
uh you know the video team fair amount
of our community team and also
generation of uh sort of content for
people to consume so jump Point magazine
which we do every month is you know 50
to 70 80 pages each month and it has
behind the scenes articles on how we
make a certain ship or how he made a
certain weapon or how we built a
character or what a certain game design
mechanic we were working on or what
happened behind the scenes going to a
show or also has sort of background
information on parts of the Star Citizen
universe and uh and fiction set in the
Star Citizen universe and it's a really
good read I would recommend checking it
out if you get a chance and then on top
of that we do quite a few sort of video
shows obviously this is one of them
around the verse is sort of the main
stay which is sort of the basically the
news of what's happening in Star Citizen
um and then we have additional shows
like bug Smashers and ship shape and uh
you know those kind of things that uh
provide additional information so thank
you subscribers for allowing us to um do
a you know probably more sort of
community facing information and content
than I think I've seen any other game do
and it's I think one of our largest uh
it's one of the largest reasons why we
we've been doing as well and you guys
have been an incredible uh you know
great loyal uh and uh you know
supportive community so thank you
subscribers um and you know speaking of
a great Community uh we had a few
backers coming by visit the office today
so this came from down in Switzerland
and uh he gave me of course a Swiss army
knife uh great for me and it says pocket
plasma torch update soon he missing the
TM on it but um it's very cool uh so
it's pretty nice uh I'm actually flying
to the UK tonight because I'm going to
be there for the next uh we go look so
KN we I won't be taking this with me on
the flight by the way um but uh I'm
flying to the UK uh tonight because I'm
going to spend the next two weeks in the
um Manchester office in the lead up to
Citizen con which is going to be in
Manchester and then uh uh right after
I'll be locking down some of the the
some of more of the scenes that we shot
and performance capture for squadron 42
kind of finish the select to finish to
sort of digitize motion capture uh you
know uh process where we sort of Select
these are the performances the parts of
the scene we want and then they gets all
the magic and it gets built into 3D and
then we can animate it uh inside 3D
environment um so I'm doing that tonight
and then the other gift I have here on
the thing is this is from operation
pitchf it's one of their challenge coins
in there um and it says for the defense
of life and Liberty we the free and
independent Citizens of Humanity declare
our intent to carry out operation
Pitchfork a coordinated strike to end
the unwarranted Vandal Slaughter of the
colony of Armitage and every human s
Anonymous 17 October
2943 so that's very cool we'll go in my
little back uh area there with all the
other really cool stuff uh which of I
have a few from the operation Pitchfork
folks and I think you guys will
actually um be quite happy at citizen
con because uh we we have uh something
that kind of speaks to this and uh uh we
be kind of a rallying cry for all you
guys um so there you go all right let's
get to the questions first one comes
from Dex who asks it's been a while
since we've heard anything about ship
armor can you tell us where it is in
development and when we'll be able to
see it implemented in the game well it's
actually implemented in the game right
now so it's been in um uh Arena
Commander for quite a while um the the
big issue is you really don't see it
because um it's sort of an invisible
item but it's an attached Von item
import to the ship um ships like um the
Hornets that have armor have the armor
item attached to them and essentially
the current implementation it's a
modifier on Damages you take so it
modifies the energy damage it modifies
the ballistic damage in the same way
that a shield a shield does except for
armor uh you know is built to sort of
absorb ballistic damage but not be very
good against absorbing energy damage and
then a shield is the exact opposite case
uh so we actually have armor Implement
in the game you don't visually see it um
we do have plans to uh add sort of the
visual representation part of it would
actually be quite easy because it's an
item that gets attached so therefore um
that will be just adding go in and the
item system already supports that we
just haven't built sort of you know like
whatever you want to call it armor um
you know reflective armor pieces that
you would now see on your your ship and
then the other thing that we've been
talking out that hasn't been fully
implemented is sort of a material swaer
change so when you change the armor on
your you can actually see a difference
in the surface quality of the places
that are armored um that's actually not
that difficult to do but it's sort of
going to be wrapped up into our
physicalized uh sort of um damage system
work that we're we're planning to do so
uh you know that's actually on Mark aent
list of two dos um but we we've got some
pretty deep um item system refactoring
for the greater good of the game uh with
him and Paul are doing right now but uh
the armor armor is actually already in
there and uh so really the key is to
make it more visible and then I think it
will also become uh more apparent and uh
uh you know more have more Nuance when
the the fully physicalized damage
systems in all right next question comes
from Doc tari who asks could you briefly
go over how coordinate spaces work in
the verse P system coordinates and
Galaxy wide coordinates so in terms of
how things work in the setup we have
right now in the system uh we consider
sort of the center of the star system to
be the origin 0000 in X Y and Z uh our
unit space in uh the engine is set up on
meters so one unit is one meter uh and
um you know the center of the solar
system would be where the the star that
everything would orbit around or the
multiple stars that people would would
orbit around uh and so right now in
terms of flying around that like
locations uh we you know kind of have a
debate about whether we give you P you
know sort of set now points like okay
here's uh arriving at this planet or
here's arriving at this asteroid field
um so there sort of navigation points
that you can enter and then also whether
you could just enter a random um sort of
XYZ position to uh Quantum to or would
we make you sort of fly to it Cruise
speed first uh basically enter that
location into your nav computer and then
you could broadcast it to your friends
and it would be a entry which is kind of
one of sort of the Explorer developer
options so we're sort of playing around
with that that concept but you you know
we are going to allow you to sort of uh
set or explore a Define off the beaten
path uh places but you know have uh
pre-done navigation points uh so you
know it's almost like you would on a GPS
I guess uh then on the Galaxy wide
coordinates um you know we would
basically specify what so system you're
in so you're in Stanton system you're in
Soul system you're in Terra system so
then you know it would potentially would
be uh you know uh you know Sol system uh
Earth or you know Sol system at this XYZ
location uh and that will potentially
you know we'll we'll we'll see how it
works because we've also had some
debates about actually having uh orbital
um mechanics so obviously an XYZ
position doesn't really work unless it's
relative uh because you know if you want
to go to Earth and it's you know at a
different point in its orbit um it won't
be there right so um so those are kind
of the things we still uh need to uh you
know flesh out um right now in the large
world map and multi crew it's XYZ in
meters uh and we give you predetermined
nav points uh and you can sort of unlock
more and more of them by exploring
around and doing stuff like that uh okay
next question comes from Monkey Time who
asks it's been said that there will be
levels of controlled and uncontrolled
space and those wishing to avoid combat
with other players should stick to the
more controlled areas does this mean
that certain career paths exploration
for example that necessitate travel into
uncontrolled or Uncharted space will be
impossible to pursue without possibility
of PVP uh that's a good question um you
know there is a certain amount if you're
traveling into Uncharted space then
there's probably not likely to be other
players out there CU you know you're one
of the first people out there so even if
there was PVP out there you probably not
likely to engage in it I mean one of the
bigger points of exploration is that uh
you know you're going to go to areas
that people haven't gone before you'll
sort of chart off the BM path as I was
mentioning just before on sort of the
coordinate space uh navigation points um
so uh it's a pretty good question I
would say that you know the PVP slider
would also come into effect there where
uh that would reduce the chance of you
having an enounter with someone that
would be hostile uh but you know if it's
totally uncontrolled and it's out there
then there would be a you know a small
remote possibility of uh PVP out there
um sort of depending so we'll see how it
goes I mean that's kind of part of
getting all up and running and see how
it works for for folks uh which is what
I would recommend doing because I know
lot of people are worried about oh there
isn't going to be enough PVP or oh my
God I'll be forced into PVP and I think
we've got a pretty good answer in the
way we set it up um that we'll have
stuff that will uh be good for both uh
both parties both groups um so uh let's
wait till we get there and if it's not
working perfectly we'll try our best to
to balance and and and fix things okay
next question comes from Dex again which
I think Dex may have sneak two questions
onto this list uh they were both heavily
uploaded I think is why apparently they
were both heavily upvoted well done
Dex I thought there was favoritism
happening here over the past few years a
lot of us have accumulated a number of
large multi crew ships can you give us
an update on your vision for NPC Crews
and what limitations if any we are
likely to see uh well you're definitely
going to uh you know need to have MPCs
uh for some of the larger ships because
they're big and uh it probably will not
be a case you'll be able to get enough
of your friends to to manage a ship with
you I mean obviously not in a
constellation but when we start to get
up to an Idris you probably would want
to have uh some NPC crew members um they
will be running just like AI the same
way we would run AI in Squadron 42 or
run AI running a big sort of MPC or AI
ship um and uh you know they they won't
be obviously as uh I you know self-aware
as as a real player would be uh and you
know you would have to be more specific
in tasking them okay you're now the
Gunner you need to go this so they won't
be sort of thinking ahead the same way
that a real person would uh but you know
they'll be they'll fill uh the various
roles um you know effectively uh
depending on kind of their rating so if
you have an experienced crew member then
they'll be able to you know be much
better at doing some of the jobs than a
rookie Junior one but of course the more
experienced folks will cost you some
more money to pay because you know none
of these NPCs are going to be working
for free so you have to you know pay uh
you know your crew and make sure they're
taken care of um and so you know they'll
be just sort of like ing folks to to you
know help whether it's run the ship
you're flying or fly escort with you um
that's actually going to be a large part
of the game I mean I've think I've
mentioned before that we have um you
know sort of a kind of goal of a 9010
ratio between Ai and uh real live
players in the in the world that will
scale that way um so you know just in
general nine out of 10 people that you
will meet will probably be in Ai and the
other one person will be a real person
um so therefore we have to make them
believe and go about their daily
activities and perform their jobs pretty
well which is sort of one of the big
focuses Tony's making with uh his
subsumption system uh for the Phan
Universe all right next question comes
from wlb who says or doesn't say ask
will orgs be able to engage in Guild
Wars against other ORS enter alliances
that give us some kind of bonus or
benefits and could an entire or become
blacklisted by law enforcement groups
like The uee advocacy similar to how in
real life a person can be arrested for
being involved with known criminal
organization like a gang Syndicate or
violent extremist group so yes
definitely you'll be able to avoid
engage in Guild Wars in fact I'm pretty
confident that there will be some Guild
Wars considering uh the amount of
different organizations that I've seen
that we have and the fact that quite a
few of them are diametrically opposed to
each other um so uh definitely and we
are building uh you know we sort of have
uh kind of three levels of uh gameplay
that we're focusing on one is the sort
of solo gameplay which is more akin to
the private of the freelancer gameplay
where you go and do your own stuff uh
you could potentially do work for bigger
organizations or other other people then
we've got the sort of uh group of
friends uh set up so think of that like
a I don't know a rating party or
something in World of Warcraft and uh
you know you and uh three or four of
your friends are flying a constellation
and you're going off on missions and
then we have sort of the big level
organization stuff where you know we're
deliberately going to have some areas
that the organizations would want to
fight over or control our own uh and uh
that would involve you know lots of
people not just three four people and
you know hundreds of people maybe not
all hundreds of people in exactly the
same instance at the same time but um
you know a bigger scale conflict where
you know people are U you know bringing
you know bigger ships uh to the fight uh
and you know working with cross per you
know sort of um various you know like
Fighters and mediumsized ships and big
cap ships and combined arms and all that
kind of stuff so we're definitely trying
to create that um level of gameplay uh
and I think it would be cool um I also
think that if an organization sort of
persists in uh attacking you know sort
of the institutions whether it's the uee
or whatever then yes at that point that
organization itself will become um you
know sort of the Enemy of the State and
will'll have ai you know say advocacy
agencies go after members of that
organization if they know or can detect
their members of that organization um so
we haven't finalized sort of the
reputation system that would go with
that and how that sort of gets
transmitted a broadcast and how you
could spoof it or hide it from people
but that would all be sort of plugged
into that and I think it should make it
a pretty interesting game dyamic and
we'll see what happens I know we've got
plenty of pirate Orcs for instance so
they'll probably be on the other side of
the law um so there you go all right
hope that answers the question all right
next question comes from weborg 1978 who
says how will trading in SC work will
there be some kind of auction house like
in MMOs will it be possible not only to
sell Goods EG data for rare oil fields
uh or can I make something like a profit
sharing for the or but I think what's
asking here is um can you
know can I sell no can I not only sell
something for money uh but could I
perhaps say hey here is information on
an or field uh but instead of you know
giving me ueec I want to take 30% of
whatever money you make from my it um so
that's a good question we're definitely
going to have the ability to do some
trading uh there will be you know kind
of the you know whatever the to do the
trade there'll be some kind of cost to
do the trade um and you know depending
on where it is or depending on like how
safe it is then the that cost would be a
larger amount than if it was sort of a
kind of no hold SP you know dodgy pirate
deal um I don't know about the profit
sharing uh giving someone saying and
give me 20 or 30% I think definitely in
the first stage of the implementation of
the game that would be a deal that you
would have to do personally and the
other player would have to sort of honor
the contract he had with you uh versus
it' be automatic in the system longer
term you never know but um you know
certainly not in the short term because
there's quite a few other things to to
get done first um so anyway there you go
I hope that helps next question comes
from Capstone who asks from a design
perspective do you see inflation or
deflation as the biggest threat to in an
MMO's economy and is one of the many
aims of this policy of setting a real
world price in U to combat gold farmer
induced inflation two real question so
you know obviously inflation and
deflation is uh kind of a threat to most
economies um you know we on our side
because you know I've mentioned the sort
of 9010 ratio of players to AI uh so 90%
of the Universe um is AI that obviously
us as the sort of game Masters um have
have an influence over um you know they
trade they go about their daily lives
they earn money um do all these things
uh so so it's actually a pretty good
tool to make sure that if a player finds
an exploit or does all this other stuff
um it won't totally creater the economy
because 90% of the Commerce is happening
inside the AI world and and we sort of
have control over that so you know if we
see something spinning out of control on
the player side we could potentially
counter it um on the AI side uh so
that's kind of one of the ideas to try
to sort of you know not be too beholden
to um you know say price fixing or any
kind of you know machinations that sort
of players could get together and do
they'll have the ability to affect some
form of the economy uh in a more
localized fashion but because there'll
only be 10% of players in the overall
Universe they won't have the ability to
affect um you know the com the economy
on sort of a more sort of um overbearing
or you know Global basis you know as far
as a real world price on U I mean you
know that's kind of our you know we're
not doing a subscription fee uh so kind
of uh you know where we think we'll be
earning money longterm to pay for the
servers and adding new content and
carrying to go and besides you know new
people joining and buying their game
package is uh you know for the people
that like love the game and but they
just don't have 30 hours a week to be
flying around doing stuff but they
really want to you know get that cool
ship or that cool weapon so they you
know they'll be able to buy some ueec
and that will sort of get them there uh
CU you know that sort of Falls to the
whole sort of Time Versus money argument
um so it's not so much to um combat gold
Farmers it's more just um to be one of
the ways it will financially support the
game going forward once it's live um we
will definitely put some things in there
to make it difficult for say a bunch of
gold Farmers to go and um you know sell
people ueec I mean there's it's almost
impossible to fully stop stuff because
people can like build up an account and
then just transfer the account and sell
it uh but we'll you know have a fair
number of uh you know you won't just be
able to wire people money um you know
with no uh at no cost and no checks and
stuff like that so so we'll see how it
goes I mean it's still early days um and
I'm sure we'll uh you know there'll be
plenty of things that we haven't
realized that we'll have to adjust um
but that's part of the point of you know
getting you guys in early next question
comes from Alan Parsons will NPCs work
for a player even when the player will
go offline or can I hire NPCs to do
missions mining hauling and myself
uh is sitting in the hanger or bar and
waiting for the NPC to finish the
mission by themselves so I definitely
don't think you're going to have NPCs
doing stuff for you when you're offline
um you you probably would be able to
hire some NPCs to go and do a mission
while you're down on Planet Side say
sitting in a bar and say here I'll pay
you this to deliver this um cargo to
this planet or this other U player and
that definitely will happen you s of
game time will tick by while you're on
your planet uh waiting for them to
finish that mission and when they do it
happen so uh so I guess you could run
sort of NPCs um just from a static
location if that was uh if that was what
you wanted to do that's kind of how um
the Design's uh set up okay next
question comes from blood prooof who
asks will there be trade Lanes similar
to the game freelancer or will Star
Citizen have open space travel only so
we're not going to have trade Lanes in
terms of any sort of mechanical trade
Lane there will be by default areas that
are sort of the trade paths because
they'll be nav boyed out and it'll be
sort of the main trade kind of routes
that various size ships will take um but
you'll also have open space travel so
you'll be able to fly anywhere in any
direction we're actually adding uh you
know additional flight modes which I've
talked about before but uh in The multic
Crew release there's going to be
Precision which is sort of the low speed
uh flying for like Landing taking off
maneuvering close to other ships or uh
structures then there's SCM space combat
maneuvering which is basically what
everyone knows from um Arena command
which is sort of the low sort of speed
um kind of space combat um uh kind of
velocity range and that's that so you
can do you know pretty drastic Maneuvers
and not uh be pulling too many G's and
then we have Cruise which is between
semm and Quantum and Cru is going a lot
faster but then you can't really turn
very fast uh and if you did you would be
sliding quite a bit uh but that's really
for sort of getting to places quickly
when you don't want to jump drive or
maybe you don't have a nav point for
them um and then beyond that would be
Quantum Drive um okay so there you go
hopefully that answer the question okay
next question comes from eshat who asks
will players traveling in fleets be able
to send out ships to scout the route
ahead how do you envision this working
with instances and the matchmaking
system yeah if you're traveling in a
fleet and you uh you know send a friend
of yours out on a ship ahead uh they can
go to uh you know another area and you
know the way the system is going to work
is that we only spin you will only hand
you off to another server um if there's
too many people um in this area space in
your server so like you know at the very
beginning if there's only two people in
the star
system um you know and say you can have
50 people in maximum in any one server
right these I'm just giving example of
numbers that's not necessarily the what
the final numbers will be um those two
people will be on the same server and
that will that will continue uh if there
was 10 there would still be those 10
people be on the same server server now
once we get over the server maximum say
50 and we move to 60 at that point we
can't fit 60 people in a in one server
so we would basically say okay let's
look at the locations and say okay well
you know here's an area that's fairly
dense say it's a planet say it's Earth
so uh in Earth that will be its own sort
of separate server Zone uh and then
people near around Earth will be talking
to the server that's controlling that
and then people on the other side of the
solar system say around Pluto or flying
around out in space would be talking to
another server and so you sort of you
sort of split out players to additional
servers as more people come into the
solar system uh and then when we have
quite a few servers running that's when
you sort of have to deal with the
instancing of like okay well we want to
keep people together if they're part of
the same sort of organization or party
or they're friendly or they've you know
noted each other as a person of interest
um so in most cases unless there's you
know you're getting into like huge
battles and loads amounts of people you
could send someone ahead to say Scout an
asteroid field and you come back and say
yeah it's fine or oh you know what
there's a couple of pirates out here and
the rest of your Fleet would come to
where you were you'd still all be in the
same server and um you know you would
have an encounter and then even if there
was you on separate servers because
there were too many people in the solar
system and the asteroid field was
handled by a different server than say
where the rest of the fleet is um we
always try to keep slots open on servers
for sort of friends to join basically
and so you know the message would go out
from your scout saying hey join me and
there'll be a certain number of slots
available for the fleet and the ones
that would be available would be filled
and if um there was too many people then
we would just have to make a decision of
do we keep the fleet together put in
another instance or do we split it up um
and we haven't really decided how that
would work yet um on that it's you know
you can have an argument for both ways
so we may make it use definable or we
may try it one way and see how it plays
um so there you go that's it that is the
10 questions and 10 for the
chairman um this is uh I think I
mentioned uh my uh well actually I time
you see this I will actually be in
England um but um I will be over in
England for about the next four weeks um
spending time in Manchester working with
a team there especially leading up to
Citizen con uh so uh next week uh you
won't have my face nice face you may we
may film one uh because Tom and the team
are coming over for citizen con so we
may film out at 10 for the chair while
I'm there you'll definitely be seeing me
on citizen Con on the live stream and
I'm really really really excited to show
you a bunch of stuff we're going to show
you I think uh you guys hopefully will
be very excited um you know it's it's uh
some cool stuff um I mean obviously we
still got loads of stuff to be doing on
all levels but um it's going to be an
awesome ride and uh anyway there you go
all right uh talk to you I'll see you in
the verse in the next few weeks
