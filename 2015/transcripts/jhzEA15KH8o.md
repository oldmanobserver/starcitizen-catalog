Hey everyone, welcome back to a new episode
of Bug Smashers. Were pretty much in a brand
new office, smashing the same old bugs. Well
new bugs, same bugs, old, eh! New bugs.
Today I wanted to show you some of the bugs
we have fixed thanks to you guys submitting
those issues into the issue council so let's
get started!
Hey everyone, welcome to visual studio. I’m
going to show you guys a couple crashes that
we have resolved thanks to you guys reporting
them in the issue council. So this first crash
that we got is anytime you shoot a gun and
it doesn’t have a particle effect or I should
say it doesn’t have a barrel assigned to
it. So on our guns we have one barrel guns,
like a standard weapon and then we have other
weapons such as one where it has a triangle,
where it shoots the top one then the bottom
one and then the right one. Basically designers
will go crazy with these weapons and you can
just assign multiple barrels and how they
shoot and interact, it’s pretty cool.
Unfortunately we have weapons that don’t
have barrels and when they try to pick an
effect off a barrel the game crashes. We’ll
probably have to fix that in the design XML
so that we have a barrel on the weapon but
for now we can at least prevent this crash
from happening. It’s actually really simple,
we just take this bit of a code and plop it
down in a nice safe area that checks to make
sure that well, we actually have barrels.
This was a code change done by jesse in the
UK and it has resolved our dedicated servers
from crashing, [Wooo!] Go jesse!
I’m going to show you guys the next guy.
So here we are in our lovely landing gear
system. We have our ship and it has little,
pretend this is a landing [Holds up a pen],
little landing things where when I land down
it might deploy out and if I go away it might
deploy back. These are not entities, but just
pure geometry that gets controlled by one
master entity.
So we can have a bunch of geometry everywhere
and they don’t have be a bunch of entities,
it’s just one that controls them all. If
we ever break the ship and split it, at the
moment we used to just hide the geometry,
but unfortunately those pieces of geometry
are still bound to the vehicle animation.
So if sometime later they would get removed
because that debris piece, we stick those
things on the debris piece, it will crash
because the vehicle still thinks it owns them
in the animation and it still tries to access
them and it goes BOOM!
So by using this little bit of code, this
new code done by steven in the UK, he’ll
actually get the vehicle and the action controller
which is basically the thing that controls
the animations for the vehicle and if we basically
remove this bit of attachment, we make sure
to clear any animations that are tied to this
thing on the vehicle. Once that’s done we
remove the attachment and this thing can be
attached to other things, removed or do whatever
we want and we won’t crash. That was a pretty
cool little crash thing there.
Finally we have a fun little crash that Paul
Rendell has done. Well this one is a little
tricky. We have our vehicle and he moves and
he sends information to the server and the
server sends information to the clients and
we keep track of the history so that we can
send basically snapshots. So I can send information
here and information here and maybe information
over here and as the other client moves he
will interpolate between those points to simulate
him moving. We don’t want to send too many
snapshots because that would introduce lag,
so we introduce just enough that they’re
far away that we can interpolate between them.
Now in this interpolation we are sending pure
world space coordinates and then we’re assigning
the position based off that directly in the
physics. The problem is if I’m in world
space here and over here I am now in a local
entity grid, like say a retaliator or constellation
and the hornet decides to smack into it, he
may enter that grid or if the ship explodes
and splits in half, the grid of that ship
might enter the grid now because the grid
has become separated.
There are all sorts of funness but basically
a vehicle can enter a grid and when that happens
we’re still sending world space coordinates,
but physics is thinking that is local space.
So when you send that big, gigantic, huge
position into this grid, it’s thinking it’s
relative to that space. So the world space
might be 2000x2000x2000, but we’re doing
it local to the grid and it’s position might
be 2000x2000x2000, but it’s going to be
relative to this so it’s going to get to
the position here and then move it 2000x2000
way over there even though it should be here.
If you get it big enough, you’ll actually
crash inside because in our local grid we
only capture 32-bit precision because don’t
need that much in a local space and if you’re
sending in this huge big number you’ll overflow
it and then you get some naughty numbers and
physics goes OMG and then [Makes a fart sound]
Explodes. So what Paul has done is if we are
sending a snapshot, recording a snapshot,
we make sure we are recording the grid we
are in and anytime we set or get positions
it will be now relative to that grid. So if
I have a world space and I have a world space
here, it will get transformed to the entity
grid here and it will be in a position that’s
not world space but relative to that grid.
So this new world, this will be to the grid
and now we can interpolate between those points
and everything will work fancy dancy.
That was actually a pretty naughty crash and
there were a couple things going back and
forth, but it seems to be doing okay. Finally
there were some good crashes fixes getting
done by Chris Rain in the Frankfurt office.
He’s been going up and down, chasing physics
trying to find all these naughty dangling
pointers, thread issues, allocation things,
you know if a thread here and a thread here
decide to access the same thing and thread
A is like: “I’m going to remake all the
memory”, and B is like: “I’m going to
touch that, KABOOM”. We have a lot of crashes
going on and a lot of guys working on some
fixes, but thanks to you guys posting on the
issue council we’ve been able to track those
down and get them fixed. Hope you guys enjoyed,
till next time?
Hope you guys enjoyed this episode of BugSmashers.
Thanks to you guys for posting those issues
on the issue council we’re able to track
down some problems, fix a bunch of crashes.
I mean all those studios, the LA studio, the
UK studio, the Austin studio, even the frankfurt
studio were all looking for these bugs that
you guys have been reporting. Fix after fix
after fix. Just today I saw a bunch from the
UK and frankfurt office and a whole bunch
of crash fixes so keep it up! We’re going
to make this build stable and we’ll see
you next time!
