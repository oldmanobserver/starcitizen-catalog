## Transcript

hey everyone welcome back to another
episode of bug Smashers uh fortunately I
didn't win one of those Emmys whatever
they be but but I did meet my one number
one
fan bug
[Music]
bashes hey everyone we're here in my
good old test level again and we have
reports of a crash when specifically the
we have some pilot or or even yourself
goes into um The Hornet and then goes
out of game mode and then back in so
let's see if we could replicate
that so we have our AI actor just going
to wait for this to and then he'll go
in ignore the lad part I broke that on
purpose doing something else so
um let's try this again
then we got the crash we are trying to
enter let's see what's
happening all right so the game is in
the process of shutting down so that we
can go back into editing mode and it's
going through all of the entities and
basically calling this event reset so
that all the entities can go back to the
default state in this case the vehicle
is
resetting and it's clearing all of its
animations and unfortunately
when it clears these animations we have
this call back here in the vehicle seat
so once the um canopy gets done opening
or the player is done walking up he sits
inside so the callbacks are still
getting set um so we're closing on the
animations they're getting done now it's
doing all these call backs and those
callbacks put the player into the seat
but unfortunately the player entity no
longer exist or that pilot I should say
that AI no longer exist so when we get
that entity ID let's see where' it
go we have well it's giving us an
invalid entity ID because that guy
doesn't exist and then we're accessing a
raw pointer here and basically the whole
game goes Kuts because we're trying to
tell someone that doesn't exist to sit
down on that seat so what we're going to
do is go into our seat reset
code and as you can see see here we're
already um canceling out some of our
animation handlings for when you're
waiting for like the can Beed open but
now we need to wait for the ones that
like the can closed after you sit down
so we're going to make sure that we
cancel all of our animation
callbacks and let's try this
[Music]
again if Visual Studio doesn't freeze
there we
go and as this loads up funny enough the
only re reason why this started popping
up was due to another
crash's see if we go to
handle start the
game so yeah the only reason this guy
started popping up is because of another
crash where
this delete action controller was
removed from uh the vehicle's Destructor
and moved into this event called done uh
the problem with having this in a
Destructor is when you're destructing
the object and you're calling all things
if they were to call back with virtual
functions you're going to start getting
into weird undefined behavior and you
will crash not all the time but
sometimes and actually depends on the
compiler and a whole bunch of other fun
things so to prevent that from happening
we basically move this delete action
controller to happen in this thing
called entity event done uh this event
done will get called out onto the entity
getting removed prior to getting it
delete so it could do some cleanup so it
doesn't have to worry about all those
funny virtual function calls but
unfortunately because of the weird
ordering of things
um that
introduced this issue right
here so we just had to make sure that we
tell all of our all of our call
animation callbacks to close up and get
done so let's let this load and try it
again all right so we're back in our fun
little test
level and look let's go back
into the game mode let our guy walk up
the stairs or the invisible
stairs and then we'll stop
it then we start it
again and Wham no
crash so now designers can get in and
out of the game mode or in between
editor and game mode oh no
and of course I crash on a completely
unrelated
issue ah the beauty of game
design so I am going to forward this to
our lovely Graphics
programmers actually yeah so hope you
guys enjoyed that fix and looks like
there'll be another one coming
soon cheers hope you guys enjoyed this
episode of bug Smashers uh we had a
little fun incident with the the
vehicles not resetting all their
animation call backs and then you know
clear it up and there then once it
clears up it goes back and then oh my
God I'm not there anymore crash so we
fixed that bad boy and then we're off to
the next bug as you see we still got a
couple more cuz I crashed right after
fixing that one so hope you guys enjoyed
and see you next
