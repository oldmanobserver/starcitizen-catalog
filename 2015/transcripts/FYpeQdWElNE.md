Intro
Hey everyone, welcome back to an exciting
new episode of BugSmashers.
Before we begin I heard some exciting news.
We’re getting a new Star Trek!
It’s going to be on CBS on-demand but it’s
a new Star Trek!
Hopefully, you know, the reboots all coming
out and about, you know Star Wars and all
that fun stuff, probably never going to get
a Firefly but, we might get another seaQuest
- ahhh yeah, that’s gonna be good.
Don’t judge me Randy.
seaQuest, out!
Eh?
Eh?
No?
Come on?
Aw...
*Bugsmashers*
Hey everyone, we are here in our fancy-dancy...
Mark’s test level, yay!
So I’m in a Retaliator and I am looking
at a optimization that we can do with the
HUD raytrace.
Pretty much all the raytraces we’re doing
with our ships.
So let's step into our fancy-dancy visor code,
depending on where the player is looking,
it will send out a trace to kind of see where
to try to converge all your weapons all onto
that point.
That’s if they have gimbals and this is
our beautiful ray world intersection or raytrace
test and we basically shoot it out every frame,
like I said, to try to hit this little point
with all your big-ass guns.
Now unfortunately, when I do this trace...
so let's hop back into the game.
We have to send in something called a skip
list.
So what the skip list is, is basically we
want to ignore certain physical things.
So if this is my beautiful ship, and I’m
a little sticky note of a player, when I’m
shooting out my ray, I might be intersecting
the ship a little bit and now my guns are
going to try to point at the ship.
We don’t want that, so instead, we have
to send in that little skip list to say “hey,
skip my vehicle and continue on.”
So that’s what this beautiful little thing
does right here is we send in a bunch of physical
entities to say “hey, skip this when you
perform the trace and find other things,”
and unfortunately our skip list has 121 things
inside of it, which is not pretty good to
do every frame since we have to rebuild the
skip list, so let's go...
here we are.
So every frame we’re adding the ship’s
physics, every actor, and every children.
And these children are basically inside our
Retaliator - we have, like, dozens of entities
that control the doors opening, some brushes,
a bunch of things to make it look beautiful
and interact-able inside.
Unfortunately, we're adding all those, plus
all the players, and as you saw, we’re at
121.
Unfortunately our limit is 128, and we don’t
want to be sending all this stuff every frame
where there’s dozens of other places that
do the same test; it’s very, very expensive.
So, what I have done, and what I’m going
to do now, is we basically don’t need to
skip these things; goodbye!
And the player is another one, so we’re
gonna get rid of that and the vehicle, and
the player is actually going through all his
item ports and adding his weapons and gear
all into the skip list.
Thing is, those items don’t have physics,
or if they do have physics, they’re part
of the player physics, so we’re basically
adding the player physics multiple times.
So we don’t really need this part, and this
is the only exception that we’ll need to
have *burps* oh, excuse me.
This is for if the player picks up something,
we don’t want, you know, that thing to be
in the test, so we'll skip whatever he’s
picking up.
So the player should just skip his physics
- so an actor, it will skip his physics and
his ragdoll physics - that’s what both of
these guys are - and ideally, the vehicle
will just skip itself.
So let's go back to our lovely visor code,
and lucky for us, we already have this global
grid setting on here.
What this means is, we're going to do the
global grids, so here's my ship, and out here
is the global grid.
So we're going to ignore basically the innards
of the ship, and we don’t care about its
door inside because we said this is the global
grid, we’re going to trace against the outside.
In that case, we only need to trace against
- er, I’m sorry - send in the skip list
of the vehicle and the actor himself and nothing
really else, and then now, we still get the
same result.
So if I hit re-code... oh no!
Re-code has failed us, so we have to do a
regular code, compile, yay!
Alright, there so that magical re-code button
worked, so now I’m going to put my breakpoint
on, and as you can see, we only have three
things to skip: We have the vehicle physics,
and my physics, and the ragdoll physics.
So we have basically optimized a fun little
raytrace - awesome!
There were some other things that I have done
as well, which I can show you real quick.
So that’s well and good, but there maybe
some times where we have to trace for certain
things, or if we want to skip certain things
while we're still in the grid.
So we have that global grid setting which
means we’ll just ignore everything but the
-- we’ll ignore the insides but we’ll
get the outside.
And what I have done too is, in the interiors
and on the vehicles, I have added, basically...
actually, where is it?
I think I put it... let's look for that bad
boy.
There you are.
So in some instances, we still wanna do the
trace but we wanna do it locally to the grid
and... but we may want to still ignore the
inner collision, but we want to get things
like, I don’t know, maybe another ship and
a ship.
So we could say, “hey we're the vehicle
perform in this trace, but I want to ignore
the insides and all the players.”
Or you could just say “I want to ignore
- I’m the vehicle and I’ll ignore all
the players.”
Or maybe you want to keep all of them.
The next thing you could do, is you could
actually put in which grid you want to specify.
So If I’m inside of here, we don’t need
to necessarily test everything out here if
I have, say, a weapon.
I just want to test the insides so I can tell
the ray world, “hey, just test for this
grid.”
So we’ve done a lot of optimizations to
our traces so it’s not all general - it’s
more “what do you want to do, how do you
want to do it” - work for that problem.
If we make it too general, you’re going
to have a problem, like, we're adding everything
into this big skip list, when we don’t need
to do that.
And, you know, performance-intense when we're
performing some of these rays per frame.
So hope you guys enjoyed my fun little spaceship,
and... cool!
So as you can see in this episode of Bugsmashers,
we’re doing some optimization where raytraces
finally got around to doing some of that stuff
and this was pretty much what we call “Code
Cleanup Fridays” where alright, we have
some fun little code that’s not as good
as it should be, so on Fridays, we’re tasked
to go and clean up those little bits, and
it comes into a little fun thing cause it’s
like, “hey, I got this thing running for
production, it’s not as best as I want,
but on Code Cleanup Friday, I’m going to
make it better because I get to have that
time to do what I need to do.”
I hope you guys enjoyed, and I’ll see you
guys next time!
