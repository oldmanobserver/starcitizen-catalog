## Transcript

hey everyone welcome back to all new
exciting bug Smashers uh we're going to
do things a little bit differently we're
going to do things in
3D right no mark That's not how 3D works
damn it Randy
no all right back to
Wy bug
[Music]
species hey everyone we're here in a fun
little test level um actually this is
going to be the next uh what do you call
it SC
2.000 fun map that you guys will get to
play and we have a fun bug where the
thrusters stop working after you get in
the ship fly it for a bit and then get
out of the seat and go back into the
seat so we are going to try to replicate
that bad boy right
now and we are in a local multiplayer
server so as as I get into my seat I can
see my fun dedicated server I'll hide
him off to the
side grabs his little
joystick wait for all the fun little
sequences so much cooler in
3D Randy was wrong
so all right we're going to fly up a bit
move
forward as you can see I could move all
way around all right let's hop back out
of the seat and see what
[Music]
happens we need like a super hyper State
animation for that oh crap Pirates are
coming we got to get in the seat fast
one
day oh no I'm getting shot but I got to
turn on all this stuff first and grab my
joystick all right so now as you can see
trying to move around I know my ship
doesn't work
no so if I actually turn
on mystical pipe
system let's this a little bit more
readable you'll notice that um all these
green things in the power none of them
well I should say there's a bunch of
items turned on but none of them are in
my thrusters so what's happening is when
I get into the seat the first time I'm
able to use the thrusters and it'll
actually show up in this thing and then
when I get out of the seat and back into
the seat I no longer am able to use the
item and as such you don't see them in
the um the power request so if I turn
off I'll leave that on and we'll go into
we call it the shared item
manager this bad boy is in charge of
saying hey if you sit down in this seat
you're going to get access to this item
this item this item and this item and
it's all controlled by the server so if
a sneaky client's like I should get this
server will be like nope so when we get
a packet from the the server um we'll
run through this bit of logic and this
is the information we get from the
server what's our Authority do we have
authority were we denied were we given
it was cancelled and the mystical is
selected um this selection is basically
all right I have the authority now I
could actually use the item so if I have
ownership of the Thruster I used the
Thruster now the Thruster is on and if
you you could toggle the Thruster on and
off by using it or selection so uh I can
turn off the Thruster turn on the
Thruster so the selection is basically
onof um and when we get or change our
Authority or if we change change our
selection it will deselect it change the
authority and reselect the item if it
needs to be and what's happening is when
we get out of the seat um we'll get a
packet saying hey we're no longer
selected and we were selected so we're
going to do our deselection cool and it
changes the authority getting lost and
we don't select it again because well we
lost it when we finally get out of the
seat The Authority now goes back to
um no longer the the owner or the actor
it goes back to just being the default
thing and what happens is the selection
gets stuck it gets set to turn on by
default and because it was off and now
it's on it gets turned off but then
since I left it it still set it's turned
on so the selection is still stuck so
when I sit back in and this is set the
true I never get my selection the client
is effectively stuck and where the
selection is set the true so what we
have to
do is instead of
serializing the
selection cuz yes it may have changed on
the server but the client we have we
don't want to change it until we have
done our selection process so I am going
to say hey we're going to store
off um we're going to go hey server
instead of writing directly into the
variable we are going to store it for
now and that way we could say hey we
were selected and if the server changes
it we're not going to change our client
state yet until after we have done the
thing so that way if the server changes
it we we could call the thing correct IR
ly so we get changed or anything the
client could replicate things so if we
don't have an authority so this would
mean like uh if we have a turret and
we're connecting and for some reason we
got our lasers before our turret and
it's not in yet we have to put in kind
of in a pending list that's what this
guy is and fortunately for us the
pending stuff will directly cost the
selection or not based on this variable
so we could just assign it to whatever
the server has told
us basically it works as what it what
has been doing before now um if we're
going to do a d selection we want to
check what the server is telling us
instead of our own
State and if we have changed now we
change our client
State
bam we have deselected now we have to do
the same thing for the server woo
up and we'll change this to our fancy
Dancy level or our
variable bam so now um when the client
gets the server information it won't
directly write into that variable
instead we will
check to see what the client has done
assuming we actually have um an
basically an authority The Authority is
you know the actual um the play player
you know sitting down in the seat it's
like he you sit here you get this this
and this so now that we have the
selection and we're making sure that we
only set the selection when we have an
authority we are going to compile and
see what
happens recode all right so as you can
see in our green little um output that
we have here we have no
thrusters and when I get off the seat it
removed all the pipes because we're not
using the thing anymore
cool up he'll get up from the
seat and then we'll sit down
again and once he has seated down we
should get all the fun
stuff bam I have gotten all the
things and
now I could
fly
whoa let my ship figure itself
out there we go actually funny
enough we only
have oh we have quite a few thrusters
you can see them here popping in and out
as you use the thrusters they'll make
heat in this case I'm looking at the
heat pipe so but you can see I'm
actually flying and everything is
connected so we are good to go woo all
right uh to recap uh we had a little
problem with our item system Authority
where the client would get locked into a
state of hey you use this item and it
would never change it so then when a new
guy popped in it wouldn't give you
access to you know your thrusters
because it was still in the selected
state and what I had to do was clean
that up a bit so when you get out of the
seat it makes sure to set the selection
the false and then when you get back
into the seat it actually now populates
it as true and allows you to do the
selection
deselection and unfortunately this has
never popped up until we got into these
bigger maps and we're starting to see
some fun little things because we're
networking a lot of stuff in these huge
Maps so we're getting all these fun
little issues that have been around but
they're more dominant in these big mapss
which is kind of cool because we get to
actually fix these things rather than
them being you know minute instances
that one guy gets but no one else gets
so it's pretty cool a little frustrating
but we're getting there hope you guys
enjoyed till next
