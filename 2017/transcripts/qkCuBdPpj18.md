Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hello and welcome to
Around the Verse, our weekly look at the development
of Star Citizen.
I’m Sandi Gardiner.
Eric Kieron Davis (EKD): And I’m Eric Kieron
Davis.
SG: While there are a lot of features planned
for the upcoming 3.0 release, one that's been
affecting just about every department is item
2.0.
EKD: Yeah that’s right and migration every
ship to this new system is an enormous task.
So today we’re going to dive in and explore
this new system and the wide ranging effects
it will have on all of our ships and vehicles.
SG: But first let's go to Austin and Turbulent
for their Studio Updates.
[0:46]Studio Update
Jake Ross (JR): Hey guys, Jake Ross here,
Producer in Austin.
The wheels are in motion on several features
here in Austin, let's dive right in and see
what’s been going on this month.
Right now the Austin design team is completely
focused on things related to 3.0 or near term
goals.
The core tasks we’ve been working on mostly
are state machines for the first few NPCs
we’ll be implementing, state machines in
organization of animation assets for the mission
givers like Miles Eckhart, and the nav beacon
system.
The state machines are how we not only visualize
how the NPC will behave, but also informs
the animation team when and where our animation
need to transition between each other.
We hand off the state machines to the animators
who then approve the behavior or give it back
with feedback.
Not only does this dreive the animations we
need, but also guides our NPC behavior setup
in subsumption.
The nav beacon system will allow players to
create their own roads throughout a given
star system.
These can be used both in the vastness of
space as well as on planetary surfaces.
Beacons are physicalized objects that are
deployed from ships and give players visual
markers to lock onto for quantum travel, they
also point to and fly towards when used on
a planetoid surface.
Players will be able to grant use access to
others as well as hack another persons beacon.
Both allows you to use someone else's nav
beacon.
Over time, beacons need to be serviced by
the owner, restoring their energy source.
Finally because they’re a physical object,
you’ll not only be able to find them and
destroy someone else's beacon if you so desire.
It should make for some fun gameplay decisions.
Do I hack it and use it myself?
Do I destroy it so others can’t travel?
Do I sell it to pirates as a potential ambush
point?
There are lots of opportunities for this new
system, we’re excited to work on and see
it progress in the future.
Finally Miles Eckhart development is in progress.
We’ve been organizing this mission givers
assets which are being polished by the animation
team in our Derby office.
Creating his state machine and getting his
initial behavior setup and running in subsumption.
Eckhart will be unlocked to the players by
accumulating reputation with him, earned by
completing other available missions.
Once unlocked, you can visit him for a wide
variety of missions.
The new mission manager will drive his selection
that you will be able to choose from anything
he currently has available.
We’re really looking forward to getting
Eckhart into your hands in the 3.0 release.
The PU Game Director, Tony Zurovec has had
his hands full with several things this month.
A major part of which is subsumption.
As a reminder, subsumption is the data driven
and highly abstracted foundation on which
all the AI and mission logic in Star Citizen
is constructed.
Tony’s finished conversion of the subsumption
tech to Linux for integration with our backend
services and completed the shopping service
for game code to start hooking the new shopping
tech into.
He’s reviewed and directed mission scenarios
for 3.0 as well.
Ship Artist, Josh Coons has been working on
the ship lods for the Cutlass Black.
It’s a very consuming task since our LODs
our mostly handmade and the ship he’s working
on is quite large with many pieces that have
to be optimized.
In addition to optimizing the mesh, he also
reduces the material IDs as he goes down to
LOD chain.
This way the mesh will have less draw calls
from a distance and be more efficient.
Our server engineers have been working very
hard since our last update.
We’ve been providing support for the shopping
service which is a non Diffusion service.
This service communicates with Diffusion and
the game systems through our Diffusion gateway.
The gateway allows external and non Diffusion
services to communicate with the game as if
they were internal Diffusion services.
Recently we’ve been focused on integration
of the Diffusion code into the primary game
development stream.
This will be deployed with 3.0.
This was a massive integration with a lot
of moving parts and has required a large amount
of collaboration between our server engineering
team and DevOps.
The effort has taken a few weeks to get everything
moved over, tested, and in a state where it
can be deployed.
From an internal perspective, we have been
working on a service creation tool.
This tool provides a simple to use UI allowing
engineers to create new services: Add, remove,
or modify components and management resource
control.
The output of the tool is a basic service
shell and set of source files that are customized
for the new service.
This is a huge time saver and allows new engineers
to create services without having to worry
about any boilerplate work and thus allowing
for rapid service development.
We’ve started to add Star Citizen specific
extensions to Ooze.
For those who don’t know, Ooze is the language
written by Lead Server Engineer, Jason Ealy.
It’s the scripting language that drives
Diffusion.
These extensions expose Star Citizen's specific
constructs to Diffusion, allowing services
to provide more intricate support for gameplay
features, helping to move the game into a
more distributed architecture.
Finally there’s been work on the router
mesh functionality.
The router mesh distributes services over
multiple router endpoints, improvised redundant
communication paths between other services.
The mesh will use a technique to isolate high
bandwidth services away from lower bandwidth
or more critical services.
The primary responsibility of the router mesh
is to provide a high level service availability
and performance.
This month on the Persistent Universe animation
team, we finished up the two handed carry
animations.
This includes standing, crouching, and for
zero g.
Standing we can pick up 25cm, 50cm, and 75cm
crates.
That is the new standard metric for crates
in game that you can pick up.
You can pick them up from the floor all the
way to a shelf that’s 175cm high.
Crouching we will be able to pick up 25, and
50cm crates from the floor all the way to
a ledge that is a 175cm high.
In zero g we will be able to grab 25, 50,
and 75cm crates floating around in space.
Code and tech has hooked it up so you can
retrieve cargo in zero g, EVA back to your
ship, stow your acquired loot in your cargo
bay.
We also did a last minute mocap shoot in our
office when Animation Director, Steve Bender
stopped by our Austin Studio for a visit.
Steve put on the mocap suit and ran around
like a crazy person capturing all of our fps
starts and stops for stock rifle locomotion
set.
We also took this opportunity to take Sandi
Gardiner in the suit and capture some exercise
motion for our female characters when they
decide to do a workout on our exercise useable.
In this mocap we stuffed our Lead Animator,
Bryan Brewer in the suit as well because we
just about killed Steve Bender on the first
day and captured needed animations for the
crouching carry animations.
We are starting work on some specific NPCs
so that you can go into a pub, get a drink
from an NPC bartender or go into a shop and
buy things from an NPC shopkeeper.
Animation is working closely with design to
make this experience a fun experience for
all.
On the ship animation team we have been continuing
our improvements with the cockpit experience.
Working with the U.K.
Studio’s design and programming team, we
are in the midst of updating our Gforce blendspace
poses, utilizing a low pass filter for smoother,
smarter camera motion as well as adjusting
the cockpit geometry to allow for button presses.
In addition to this, we are creating the system
that will allow us to make coms calls within
the ships during flight.
This month the DevOps team has been busy optimizing
the build and publishing systems.
The game builds are growing rapidly as content
continues to pour in for 3.0 sp we’re constantly
tweaking and tuning to keep up with the demands
of the dev team.
Ahmed and his team have been collecting team
feedback on network performance from our three
locations and comparing that to internal data
so we can optimize network performance wherever
possible.
This is an ongoing task, but we’ve also
found some good opportunities for improvement
in this area.
For May, the Austin QA has been working heavily
on regression of bugs, particularly on a massive
sweep through our open bugs to see what items
are still valid given the new systems and
tech coming online for both the PU and Squadron
42.
This allowed us to eliminate a considerable
number of bugs before they ever reached development,
saving our busy developer cohorts time they
would have spent investigating issues that
no longer were occurring on the latest build.
Major testing items for our groups including
actor serialization, multithreaded resource
containers and network transport queue for
the engineering teams.
We continue testing the moons in the Stanton
system for any potential issues such as collision
and performance testing.
New vehicles, ships, and FPS items came online
throughout the month including the Behring
P8SC SMG that we were very excited to play
with.
In addition to testing the continued item
2.0 implementation all of which have kept
our Arena Commander and Star Marine testers
busy.
On the new system front we’ve been working
very hard testing the new procedural breathing
and stamina system as well as a new air traffic
controller.
Other projects we’ve been assisting with
have included testing some updates to our
current game launcher.
Primarily bugfixes to our players, but also
a few quality of life fixes.
We continue providing additional support for
the animation groups here in Austin.
Including mocap file cleanup, supporting setup
and teardown for pickup shoots and ingame
video captures for final reviews.
Regular editor and engine testing has continued
as well with Austin QA completing regular
smokes in the subsumption editor, procedural
planet tools as well as our normal editor
testing.
Player relations team has been extremely busy
preparing for upcoming 3.0 work as well.
The biggest item that players will see is
the new player experience that will ultimately
go on the website and will match the new content
coming up in the game.
They’ll also be adding to the Evocati ranks
in the upcoming weeks and are excited to announce
that they’ll be adding headcount in Austin,
Manchester, and Frankfurt.
We’re getting more and more excited the
closer we get to 3.0 release.
We have a ton of new content we’re pumped
to show off and get into your hands.
Thanks for everything you do, keep it up,
we’ll see you around.
Benoit Beausejour (BB): Hi guys, here’s
your Star Citizen platform update, but to
start somebody you haven’t seen in awhile,
We’ll see Benjamin Fardel to talk to us
about other projects here at Turbulent.
Benjamin Fardel (BF): Hi I’m Benjamin Fardel
and this is the Turbulent monthly update for
the month of May.
This month we’ve been working really hard
on redesigning a huge section of the RSI website.
What we’re designing now is a consolidated
view of everything that’s currently playable,
what you can currently do in the game and
that will hopefully make it more understandable
and more useable for any newcomers and existing
players too.
Our US and content teams came forward to us
with a lot of examples that we took great
inspirations from about websites that felt
particularly immersive of games that were
making it easy to get into the universe, their
backstory and get involved into what the game
is without actually having played it yuet
and that’s what we’re going for now so
that people can come in and know what Star
Citizen is about even before engaging the
rest of the community, but what those websites
have in common is they make high use of a
clean streamlined design and images and videos
that make you feel like you’re becoming
into the game as you watch them.
So that’s the inspiration we took from there
is we’re making it all about making Star
Citizen shine in the website by showing and
showcasing what it has accomplished so far
which is fantastic.
We felt that we have more than enough material
to make a compelling view of what Star Citizen
is now even that far into the process.
We also took a lot of inspiration from what
the community has been producing.
We have witnessed a lot of incredible production
from members of the community, videos produced
in the director mode, but also tutorial videos
and streams, the whole setups that people
have when they broadcast about Star Citizen
and that became a great input in the design
that we put for Star Citizen.
A new module we’re implementing for this
new release of RSI is a new play guide which
is going to be a new module that covers all
the bases you need to know, not necessarily
if you want to get good at Star Citizen from
the get go, but if you just want to learn
how you start playing the game.
So we’re working really closely with all
of the CIG teams in player relations, QA,
and marketing so that we can cover all the
bases of everything that new players need
to know when they want to start playing the
game and we’re designing this as a modular
interface that we can make evolve as new patches
come in and new features come in so that it
can become a staple feature of the website
when you want to point to something that’s
currently playable in the game.
So keep your eyes open for this new and redesigned
Star Citizen website coming in this summer.
BB: So in the past few weeks we’ve been
hard at work reviewing the first two months
of live operations for our Spectrum Alpha.
We’ve been reading all of your feedback
and compiling all of it.
We’ve already begun some work, but in this
release that we’re preparing now called
0.3.5.
We’ve got major updates and major changes
to the system which I think you guys will
like.
The first one is we’re transferring the
view preference for threads.
So instead of somebody creating a new thread
and choosing which type of discussion, is
going to be fully managed by a view mode which
the viewer can decide so you’ll be able
to set a global setting to decide if you want
to see threads as nested or chronological
or we call them classic now, or you can also
per thread decide that you want to see this
thread that’s chronological, but this one
is nested.
So we’re going to persist your choice across
sessions and so this basically becomes a completely
user preference is hopefully…
guys who prefer chronological threads versus
nested will be able to just see chronological
across the board and hopefully you guys will
like that.
We’ve also done major work in this release
to try and unify what we call the read state
which is if you’ve read a thread or a reply
already and so now we’ve changed the UI
so that we display a yellow dot for items
you have no read.
So this will reflect in your sidebar on the
left, but also on threads and on every reply
within a thread.
So this will help nested thread users who
want to know if they have read a reply or
not through the tree, even if it’s not chronological
you will be able to see, haven’t this reply
or have seen it before.
One major change that we’re also implementing
is related to tags.
So we’re changing the way we’re now surfacing
tags on the community index so that you’ll
be able to jump directly from the list of
channels to a tag straight up which is basically
much more functional as a subforum.
The tags are also now can be set to mandatory
so now when you create a channel you can say:
“this channel requires tags or not.”
They’re browsable from the community index
and the channel directly.
They’re also bookmarkable so you can bookmark
a tag within a channel if that’s what you’re
interested in and they’re also now these
bookmarks which are now and this applies for
every bookmark, every bookmark are now renamable
so you can go in your managed bookmarks and
change the name of your bookmarks to something
that you want, organize your sidebar the way
you want.
So this applies to tags, but also to every
other type of bookmarks that you’ll store
in the sidebar.
0.3.5 also comes with major changes to search.
We’re adding new filters that will allow
you to filter by author and by role.
So you’ll be able to search by for all staff
posts for example or search for every post
from this user within the community or all
communities you have access too.
So this will make search more viable.
It’s also now accessible on mobile which
it wasn’t before so now if you’re on a
mobile screen, the search options will display
and you’ll be able to use them.
0.3.5 also comes with a lot of work behind
the scenes where we’ve been looking at usage
patterns over the past few weeks and there’s
a lot of performance updates we’ve done
so Spectrum should load faster for you guys.
The thread listing should be at least 10 times
faster than it was before.
We’ve added a lot of server side reporting
so we can track client crashes and basically
try to preempt fixing stuff without having
you guys report them, it’s all automated
for us so that’s really great.
So this is it for 0.3.5 so a lot of changes
coming up.
We’re hoping that by the time you see this
it's already live.
It’ll be a matter of day if that’s not
the case so see you guys on zero 0.3.5.
In terms of 0.3.6.
Which is our next shorter term version.
We’re working on revamping the mini profiles
to display more information about you guys.
Have a bunch of actions available on the mini
profiles.
We’re going to more of a calmer display,
they’ll be able to jump from the miniprofile
to a user's post and take action specifically
on that user.
This is where we’re going to add later on,
not in this release, but later on all the
functions for friends lists, friend system,
blocking will go in that area.
The major feature for 0.3.6.
is the availability of custom roles and so
we want orgs to be able to add additional
roles to their org, assign roles to their
members, all done through the mini profile
directly on Spectrum so that’s going to
be a big thing for 0.3.6.
There’s also work going on in the editor
for the forums to allow endline images, linked
formatting and more formatting options.
This is tuning out to be a bigger project
than we thought, but we’re hoping that it’s
going to be ready in 0.3.6 for you guys to
use straight on the live site.
There’s also group private messaging that
we’re trying to achieve in 0.3.6, though
this is more looking like a 3.7 feature, but
we’re still working on it and of course
all the background work related to voice transmission
and game integration is ongoing, but you know
this is basically what we’re looking for
in Spectrum for 0.3.6
[17:22] Back to Studio
SG: and it’s great to see subsumption taking
another step forward.
The system is the bedrock for so much of the
game so it’s exciting to see it all coming
online.
EKD: Yeah and the PU Game Director, Tony Zurovec
who is creating the tech is in Los Angeles
this week working with the team on subsumption
and many other important features.
SG: Another new system that you’ve heard
mentioned in previous studio updates is Item
2.0.
It lays the groundwork for swappable ship
component and so much more.
Once fully implemented Item 2.0 will provide
the framework for many cool features to come.
EKD: Yeah and although converting ships to
this technology is well underway, we thought
it would be good to explain the facets of
this system and highlight just how important
Item 2.0 will be to improving the overall
Star Citizen experience.
[18:08] Ship Migration Part 1
Kirk Tome (KT): Hi.
I'm Kirk Tome, and I'm the lead technical
designer here at Cloud Imperium Games.
Mark Abent (MA): My name's Mark Abent.
I'm a senior game-play programmer here, and
I'm also known as the Bugsmasher … -ish
[Chuckles] Yes it's that tacky, but it's great.
[Laughs]
Ashram Kain (AK) Hi.
My name's Ashram Kain.
I'm a producer here in Los Angeles working
primarily with the engineering and tech design
team.
So part of my job is working with engineering
and tech design to get all of our ships converted
over to a new framework, our Item 2.0 Framework,
which is going to support all of the multitude
of features that we want to have in our ships
moving forward in the game.
The reason we had to do this conversion to
get all of these ships into this new framework
was to support the kind of features we wanted
in the long term.
KT: In the case of ships that already existed
we do need to update various components, the
seats, the way we enter the ships and the
way we interact with the items and the various
systems on the ships so we can make them work
with the new interaction system.
In the cases of new systems we need to implement
them in accordance of the new architecture.
AK: It's easy enough to make a spaceship and
put it in the game … not that easy, but
compared to what we're trying to do it's a
walk in the park.
But when you want to have a spaceship with
modular components that's upgradable, swappable,
changeable, damageable … when you want to
have ships that die, because components fail
inside or ships that explode, because of damage
done to important internal pieces.
That's not something you can do with a out-of-the-box
system.
That's something you have to build from scratch.
Honestly this conversion is involving every
single team in the entire studio.
There is not a team that is not part of this,
and I mean everybody from marketing all the
way to the physics guys in Germany who are
having to be part of this, because this conversion
touches everything.
It's primarily being driven by LA Engineering
and LA Tech Design through Mark Abent and
Kirk Tome.
MA: So as you guys know now the current release
we're using the 1.0 infrastructure, and we've
used that since basically we released the
dogfight module way back in … during the
dinosaur era.
That system worked really, really great for
our single shooter ships where you just have
a guy sitting here maybe one copilot, but
when you started having these much more big
complex ships and you're just adding a bunch
of items onto there it became a big gigantic
behemoth to maintain our item infrastructure.
The biggest issue we had is we have our ship
he knows all of the items that are attached
onto here, and when you have a guy right here
he gets all of these callbacks and events
saying, “Hey this was added”; “this
was added” and “you have control”; “you
have control”, but we have another seat,
since that event system was basically on the
main route of the ship he would get those
same events.
So if you had five seats, they would get events
from everybody else and then every other seat
had to figure out who had what control and
where, and then you had a more complex thing
because then you had the visor or the HUD
or the UI, you had the AI, you had the different
modules all listening for these events trying
to figure out who had control when/how, and
then when you add in multiplayer where this
seat could come before the vehicle, and then
this item could come, and then we had to reconnect
this here.
Anything could come in any order.
It just became pure chaos trying to make sure
everything worked in a nice coherent manner.
As you can tell we had a lot of fun bugs and
it's also not maintainable, especially since
each of those items were their very own special
cupcakes where we had all this logic built
in for the weapons, and if we want to use
a single part of it like say we had another
type of weapon that didn't shoot projectiles
it shot some … We want to shoot M50s out.
You had to basically copy/pasta that logic
into that other item and then you have another
set of bugs, because you have to maintain
two sets of logics blocks and this was the
whole Item 1.0 infrastructure, so it just
became a mess.
Going back to that big logical block we want
to take each of those bits of logic and turn
them into these bits of … what we call them
components.
This thing handles geometry.
We take it out.
Stick it in a component that handles geometry.
This thing handles physics.
Take that out and stick it into a component
that has physics.
The idea was we shrink this item into nothing
but it's bare bones and it's just a list of
logical blocks or bare components that defined
what the item actually did.
So in theory I could take this piece; put
it here.
Take this piece; put it here, and now I have
a whole new weapon or I have a whole new logical
item that we wanted to do, and that was the
very bare bones Item 2.0 or infrastructure.
KT: So the Item 2.0 System comes as a lot
of different components to make ships fit
within our new architecture.
The items that we're improving the game-play
functionality on are systems like power, cooling,
the shield system, utilizing our new room
system when you turn power off to a particular
room all the lights that are in there will
automatically turn off, or when you open up
a door that's connected to that room entity
we can suck the atmosphere out.
Being able to do things like set a door lock
in between those two rooms so that we can
simply connect those two rooms utilizing that
airlock, and it knows the states of the atmospheric
conditions within their zones and can react
accordingly when you open that airlock implementing
new ways in which atmospheric flight affects
your fuel consumption, how those thrusters
actually utilize power and fuel to fly, better
systems for functionality such as quantum
drives.
We're able to balance the fuel consumption
that ships will take to go from one nav-point
to another, therefore we can make some other
ships that are larger and perhaps have a larger
quantum fuel tank be able to traverse the
… make those trips without running out of
fuel whereas some of the smaller ships maybe
they can't, and they must refuel before they
can take that next jump.
These are all parameters that we are updating
and making it a little bit more transparent
for the player to understand what's going
on with them.
MA: So now that you have this control, it's
cool and the problem is how do you interact
with this control?
And that's where we bring in this other set
of technology that we have which is the Interaction
System.
We had an old interaction system that hit
a button and it did something, but now we
have a much more contextual system where you
can register these things called interactions
on interaction points, and what that allows
us to do is we can build a list of these things
and then the code gets some callbacks and
if I look at say a door I could get two interactions
maybe open and close, and then code could
get those and figure out what to do with them.
Using this thing with the control thing is
basically we have this thing called a seat
access at what seats.
Before we have this ship called a Constellation,
and we have these two turrets, and the thing
about the turrets is that when one came down
it had to block the other one, but we couldn't
do that on the old one.
So we kind of had to … you can actually
do this now with the existing system.
If you use the top turret you can use the
bottom turret, and you can see the animations
messing with each other, because these two
seats don't know about each other.
But now we have this thing called a seat access
that is aware of these two.
It's basically the state machine for these
two things.
So if you want to get into either one, it
will block the other one.
And we do that by using the Interactions System.
The top one has an interaction to enter/exit.
The bottom one has an interaction to enter/exit,
and there's an invisible physics box, but
you'll just see a glowing thing saying that
I can enter this turret or enter this turret.
You walk up to it and you see the actual floating
text saying, “I want to enter the top”/”I
want to enter the bottom”, so when I enter
the top the code will get the callback saying
that I should begin to move this one down,
and the seat access will be, “Alright since
this one is moving down I can block this one”.
So now if someone walks up as you are entering
this guy, he won't get any interactions, because
he can't enter this one because he was blocked
until this guy goes up to the top, and then
now that interaction will pop up saying, “Hey,
you can enter now”.
AK: This isn't simply an engineering task
or a design task.
We're having to revisit animations.
We're trying to revisit entire structures
inside how ships are built from the ground
up which means we are trying to reconsider
how doors, simple doors, are implemented on
the interior and exterior of the ship, and
that's art time.
That's time that the artists and modelers
have to be involved in, and part of that means
we're also having to do rework on some of
the damage materials, the UV2s that we use
for our damage states ... literally every
team.
One of the biggest impacts is things you wouldn't
think about like the prop team, because we're
having to do things like build our power components
and our modular power supplies.
That means we need a prop for that, and that
prop needs to be built by somebody.
So, all of the sudden things you never really
saw on the ships but we're kinda there, I
mean they were a little bit hidden, they're
suddenly going to be there, and as we start
rolling out this technology more and more
and implementing it through later iterations
in the ships you're going to be able to see
these components inside the ships, and that
means we need to have those components to
show.
Mark Abent(MA): One awesome example of moving
one of the items to this whole new Item 2.0
centric system on the vehicles is we have
these lights on your spaceship, and with our
1.0 or legacy ships, we had an item that attached
to an item port and it would create these
things called…
basically rendered out all along the ship.
It would look cool and I could see the lights
on, problem is I get out of the ship or the
wing blows off, lights are technically still
there.
We did cheat and listen for when something
blew off but power doesn’t do anything,
can’t control them, they’re always kinda
on.
So what we did for 2.0 is we have this technology
called an Object Container in the inside of
our ships it’s basically a mini level we
can insert into our ships.
So we already have that, we’re using it
for Item 1.0 and what we want to do is since
designers are placing a bunch of stuff like
beds and all that stuff in there, we wanted
them to use that same technology to move…
have lights, the same lights that were defined
before.
So we basically tossed the old system, allowed
designers to create lights and using this
thing called light groups you can designate
that these lights are basically, you know,
the interior.
These lights are the exterior and a way of
grouping them.
When you export that level it creates these
things calls item ports but we attach these
lights on the item ports and since they’re
on item ports, the control manager now knows
about them.
Since they’re an item and they have an item
port, they can get power, they can get control.
So now they register to this thing called
the control manager and they register to the
item ports and they can actually request to
get power, they can request to get heat and
if they don’t get it… we can turn off
the lights.
We could do anything we want and we took it
a step further, we have this thing called
a light controller, it registers to the control
manager and those lights register to that
and if the user sits down in the seat, and
get into the control manager I get a button
to turn off those lights that are inside of
the ship that normally don’t spawn in.
AK: It’s not something you can just sit
down and say, ‘we’re going to do this
ship, the this ship, then this ship’, cause
it doesn’t work like that.
Each of these systems is so deeply interconnected
that when we encounter a bug on one ship,
we just can’t stop and wait for that bug
to be fixed.
We have to move onto another ship that we
can work on, we’re having to work so quickly
on so many different complicated pieces and
track all of the bugs that the real challenge
is being able to predict where we’re going
to be.
The whole point of scheduling isn’t to make
a plan on how to get some place, that’s
the easy part.
It’s being able to show where we think we’re
going to be based on the work that we’re
doing and the work that we’ve done.
This work has never been done before, nothing
like this has ever been done before.
KT: The other difficult issue is that we do
need to go in and do an entire retrofit of
every single ship from step one.
Some of the steps include converting the ship’s
seats to the new system, creating a new dashboard
element which is the part of the ship when
you’re seated in the cockpit that you interact
with so that we can have visual interactions
that allow you to turn power on, engine on
and off, set the ship to flight ready.
These are interactions that occur automatically
before, now we’re going to give the player
a little bit more control to give them a more
visceral feel when they’re in the cockpit.
This can also be true for other stations when
you’re seated, get an engineering station
going will allow you to aim in a certain direction,
hit a button this does a particular task.
Then utilize the screen so that you can divert
power to repairing, swap out individual items
on the ship, etc.
So in some cases we take the old assets and
then update the code we use to implement them,
in other cases we update the assets themselves
so that it’ll adhere to the new code standard
that we need but in most cases we’ll do
both.
So, we’ll take the dashboard out of the
ship geometry, make it its own item and then
set up the interaction points so that when
the player does get seated in the seat…
they’ll have an indication of where to look
at to do these interactions.
AK: Coordinating all of these teams is a real
challenge because we’re talking about 400
people who need to be aware of what’s happening
and the hardest part in coordinating all these
teams isn’t necessarily tracking the tasks
or the individual work on any given person.
Making sure that all the teams are aware of
what’s happening and what’s coming down
the pipeline, we don’t want to break something
that’s going to then prevent one of the
teams from being able to work.
A good example of this I can give is AI team,
we’re having to be very conscious of delivering
components and pieces of this feature in time
for AI to have the opportunity to implement
and integrate that with their system.
So that, you know, we can have people inside
these ships and they can fly around and interact
in all the different game worlds.
This is particularly vexing when it gets to
more complicated parts of the interaction
system because these ships have a lot of interactions,
so making sure that all the interactions are
functioning is sort of the key point to making
sure we can interface with these ships as
we change and integrate them into Item System
2.0.
Then there’s the tertiary stuff that you
don’t really think about when you’re considering
doing all of this stuff.
How does this interface with stations?
How is this going to work when you go buy,
sell and be cognizant of all of the items
inside your ship inventory, your personal
inventory, your player inventory and then
where do we want to go with that.
How does the economy interface with all these
other pieces.
So, maybe you should let everyone who’s
cognizant of the long term goals as well as
present in what we’re trying to achieve
for 3.0 and 3.1, that’s the biggest challenge.
KT: There will be some balance tweaks that
the player will notice which will incentivize
the player to explore upgraded items for example,
especially ships, because we are utilizing
the new interaction system.
It’s the first thing that they’ll notice
when they walk up to a ship and when they
get sat down and look at the cockpit there
will be a noticeable difference.
AK: Game play is one of the most interesting
challenges in this conversion because at once
we need to maintain game play that the community
loves and the balance and the hard work that
the balanced designers implemented on these
ships.
So on the other hand we have a to implement
a whole new way of thinking about the ships
and the ship balance.
We have to implement new ways for the thrusters
to function, we’re rebuilding parts of IFCS
and integrating IFCS into the Item Component
System.
That means that we have to reconsider that
balance as well.
Suddenly a fighter is no longer just a fighter
when you have to worry about managing your
shields and your power supply and your weapon
group, really… in real time.
With Item System 2.0 we’re going to have
a lot more capacity for multicrew ships as
well.
It’s no longer going to be, ‘oh I’m
riding around in your Caterpillar’, it’s
going to be, ‘I need somebody on the shields
and the power at the engineering station to
manage this as I’m in a heavy fight’.
MA: One of the big things is probably performance.
With this componentized system, each of these
components…
so if we have a seat, we can have geometry,
we can have physics, we can have a bunch of
other logic.
Each one can have their own update but they
can update on this thing called a batch update
which means during a specific time in the
frame, we can basically spawn a bunch of threads
and say, ‘you’re updating, you’re updating,
you’re updating, you’re updating and you’re
updating’.
We may do like a couple thousand at one go
and then do another thousand and then do another
thousand so that frame update from like this
to like this, and we can do a lot more.
One of the biggest improvements we’re hoping
is going to be with John Pritchett’s physics
flight controller, the IFCS.
We just actually recently moved his update
block from kinda main thread physics call
and it was stalling physics and taking that
out and moving it to these batch updates and
it will still act the same, it’s now just
spawned off into one of those threads.
So we’re pretty much utilizing multicore
systems at this point.
AK: This is one of the largest things I’ve
ever worked on and it singularly can be considered
one of the largest things that I think has
ever been done in a game, particularly a multiplayer
game.
This is a system that…
I mean think about the multiplayer games that
are out there, I mean you might have a mount
in World of Warcraft or Elder Scrolls Online
or a house but you don’t fly your house
around.
You don’t have twenty houses that you fly
around and you have to worry about them being
damaged and the states they’re all going
to be in and how other players are going to
interface with them, that’s something we’re
having to consider.
When we talk about Item System…
Item System is more than just the things in
the ship or the things on the space station
or the things on the planet.
Its an entire framework for objects and entities
in game persistence being persisted and having
actual relevant information to be part of
that player experience.
I think players are going to start seeing
an incredible versatility and power to this
technology.
MA: So that was some of the big architectural
changes we wanted to do but of course changing
something huge is going to have some big repercussions.
Stay tuned next time where we’ll tell you
about some horrible, horrible fun that we
had to do when transitioning from A to B.
[37:09] Outro
EKD: Thanks guys.
Converting the game to Item 2.0 is really
no small task, but it’s an essential one
to building the Best Damn Space Sim Ever.
SG: Yes and it will add a lot of versatility
to ships and let players interact with them
like never before.
It should have a significant impact on gameplay.
EKD: And that’s it for today’s episode.
Please join us tomorrow for Happy Hour Friday
at 12pm Pacific as Mark Abent and Ashram Kain
join us to talk more about Item 2.0.
SG: And thanks to all of our subscribers who
make shows like ATV, and Happy Hour possible.
EKD: And thank you to all of our backers.
We really couldn’t build a game with hundreds
of swappable ship components without your
support.
SG: And that’s all for this week.
We will see you…
SG/EKD: Around the Verse.
