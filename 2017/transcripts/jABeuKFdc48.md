hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers I'm
your host Mark aent I'm a gameplay
programmer here at caga and I'm here to
show you the
bugs bug bashes
hey everyone uh we have quite of an
interesting bug today um I am going to
actually show you guys the video before
I even get into the game I think you
guys might like this
one
so let's pause it what's happening is in
Star Marine if you have all your weapons
fully loaded out so you have no more
slots and then you zoom in you watch
walk up to another weapon and you hit
the use key to pick it up this is what
happens
Wham he's going up to it use it and zoom
now he has an out-of- Body Experience
apparently using the weapon takes you
out of the universe let's do that again
cuz that is awesome
play going to use that weapon going to
use the weapon and I'm out of
[Laughter]
here ah good fun time times now let's
start up the editor and
unfortunately uh this bug really depends
on your CPU and whether or not um you
hit it it'll either get this crazy out
of body experience or your helmet will
just get really close and it looks kind
of weird uh as the editor loads I can
show you the offending bits of code uh
so in the actor or the player we have
this view component which is charge of
how the camera is affecting him fov
distance location and Etc and when it
comes into this little beauty it's
supposed to take the fov and move the
camera back a certain distance based on
that and when you have zero fov it's
supposed to just have no offset it's
just where you are um but as you get
closer and closer to
zero it's going to you just radically go
insane because of this beautiful bit
right here
um actually I'm sorry this beautiful bit
right here a little combination of these
two so we take our FV we do a tangent
and tangent of zero is going to give it
zero but as you get closer and closer to
zero it's going to get zero but this is
basically going to be a really really
small number um something larger than
zero but less than one and when you
divide by a number it's just going to
grow and I could prove that for
you I have that value 13 if I divide by
one I get one I divide by um really
small value I get a huge huge value and
as you can tell the the smaller and
smaller I
get the larger the value I'm going to
get and so when we have our fov and our
iron site and all that fun stuff what's
going to happen is we're going to alert
between the value you want to and the
value we want to go to so if we have 55
and we want to go to zero it's going to
lurp in between that so between one and
zero you're going to get this exploding
value that just goes Bonkers and if you
have a fast CPU you might go from 1 to
zero instantly if you have a slow CPU
might go from
1.8.5 3 3.2 and Etc so unfortunately
this bit of code right here will just
explode and with iron sight oh beautiful
iron sight we have an end Zoom fov scale
which ass sets it by default zero uh so
when you're in Iron site and you get out
it transitions to zero and if you're on
um an fov that you want to get to I
don't know you're on 55 and then now
this thing's telling you to go to zero
you're going to do do that lurp and then
it's going to be big
expansion um so let's hop into the fancy
Dancy test level of mine uh we're going
to pop down some beautiful
weapons we'll plop
[Music]
down where did it
go give ourselves a rifle
ah give this energy
weapon do two of
those change our
Loadout so we already have
weapons so now we have some
weapons we're going to zoom in and grab
something
then let's try grabbing another
guy come on you know you want to break
no so as you can see I'm not able to
really get the issue because my machine
just so happens to be special um but if
I were to have the
issue he' be this beautiful longevity
thing all right so what is the fix
simple um our V scale should actually
default to one
and in here we should really be checking
to see if we are um less than
one
because um anything less than one F A
doesn't really make sense here if we're
one we should
just um return as might want this 13
offset because that looks like the
theault N we'll just keep it as zero
offset I mean if we ever get to
one we should not be exploding the
camera so we'll hit recode and Theory we
should never have that fov but because
of this end Zoom scale it was modifying
the fov we wanted with zero and that
caused everything to go Bonkers and if
you
recode um everything will work out fine
and H we have to watch it again I'm
sorry but this is just
great it's one of those bugs you just
don't want to fix but you have to all
right so now we have a safety check so
if we're less than one it will just keep
the camera there and you won't zoom out
uh the FV will still be a little bit
Bonkers um if anything we should
probably add an assert and the iron
sight will no longer cause the fov to be
zero because we Now default the scale
hope you guys enjoyed until next time so
as you guys saw we had a pretty crazy
bug there where you go pick up a weapon
and the player just shoots off in the
space because his fov goes to near zero
and everything just goes
Bonkers um it was a pretty easy change
to make sure that the fov um if it gets
too low we don't run some code to
stretch out the length of the camera and
everything worked out too good and I
hope you guys enjoyed till next time
thank you for watching so if you want to
keep it with the latest and greatest in
