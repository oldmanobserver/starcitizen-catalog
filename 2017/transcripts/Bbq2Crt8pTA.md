## Transcript

hello and welcome to around the verse
our weekly look at the development of
Star Citizen I'm Eric Kiren Davis Senior
producer and I'm Steve Bender animation
director over here at cig so Eric I
heard you be on a WonderCon panel this
hour yeah I'll be joining narrative
designer Chris Avalon uh author Janice
Davis screenwriter Adam G Simon and
composer Shawn pack to discuss how to
make a career as a creative professional
well very cool and that's for WonderCon
attendees yes if you have a badge you
can attend and I'd love to see anyone
who can make it there on Saturday event
details can be found online in your
Wonder con program awesome well we have
a great episode today to celebrate its
reveal in the 262 patch we can finally
share share part two of the ship
pipeline video that follows the
completion of the Drake Buccaneer but
first let's go to Brian Chambers in
Germany for their Studio
update hi everyone I am Brian Chambers
the development director here at Foundry
42 Frankfurt uh we started Foundry 42
Frankfurt a little over two years ago
with six employees this past month we
just signed our 7eventh member of the
team 70 we've come a long way in a short
time from an office mostly filled with
empty desks to now in almost full full
office working across most all
disciplines this past month has been
busy as usual at one point we had I
believe 15 visitors here from other
offices working across various
disciplines we occasionally travel to
the other offices to meet and discuss
future plans review progress in certain
areas uh kickoff large tasks Etc so
let's jump right into it see what the
team's been working on over the past few
weeks starting off with the weapons team
the FPS weapon artist finished a second
art path on the Clauson verer arkite 2
the gallant and the arrowhead these now
include new venting mechanisms which add
much more visual interest when you're
doing things such as reloads and so on
uh they also completed the first art
pass on the cak Arms ravager 22 and a
second art pass on the CAC arms
Devastator with an additional layer of
detail for the ship weapons we completed
all the rockets and Rocket pods ranging
from size one all the way to three as
well as the first art pass for the
nightsbridge arms ballistic cannons we
can now use those various sizes to test
out the new modularity system and
various upgrade levels and combinations
to see what we can come up with in the
office here in Frankfurt we recently
hired a lead lighting artist uh to work
with a global lighting team one of his
first tasks was modular surface Outpost
and determining how we'll integrate
Lighting in such a way that it feels
coherent across potentially countless
permutations of The Outpost layout every
single room could have a different
arrangement of props and objects which
then dictates where lights would
logically be placed as well as the
specific theme or mood for that room
that we're after for example crew
sleeping quarters need to have a
different mood than a hydroponic slab
Etc our first step though is to
integrate simple lighting variations
into the procedural system so we can
discover and solve any issues that may
arise such as light leaking through
walls or certain lighting variations
looking incorrect when placed next to
each other and so on see really see what
conflicts at the same time these
technical challenges we're also focusing
on creating a visual Target for our main
room types habitation Hydroponics
engineering storage see how far we can
push the lighting to match our Concepts
and goals for the interior look of our
surface
outposts when these are finished we can
then determine how to break the lighting
down into modular components that can
then be fed all the way back into the
procedural system and be applied to all
the other procedural bits we
have uh the tech Guard team here in
Frankfurt worked on multiple skinning
tasks this month including clothing for
both the Pu and Squadron 42 to widen the
range of customer uh character
customization and a skinny pass on the
final vanuel mesh so the animators can
work across on their animations they
worked on a tool for the animators to
redirect their walking animations to
turn animations it's a fairly simple
tool uh but ultimately it reduce the
time that the animators need to spend on
creating those specific animations in a
sense it allows us to to reuse and cycle
uh they also created a tool to allow the
team to quickly update the exact grip
placements of individual weapons artists
can now use a reference mesh create an
offset hit export and immediately see
the changes live in engine uh this
things makes things much more efficient
allows them to iterate much more quicker
than they did
before the level design team here in
frankfurt's busy working on the
modularity of space stations and surface
Outpost as seen in a recent ATV episode
as an initial proof of concept we have
five versions of The Outpost that we're
moving forward with in the future we'll
be able to create a large number of
outposts with different layouts and
purpose but as an initial step we focus
on just a few to ensure that the systems
props placement of planets blah blah
blah blah all working together as we
intend uh the truck stop is our first
test of modularity in space stations
we've been working on customizable hubs
to be able to create variations using
add-ons and procedural plot placement to
add flavor to various
rooms the modularity of space stations
also extends to how the rooms connect to
one another following pre-made
flowcharts we're currently working with
Engineers to get it functioning in game
and get it all going the way we actually
intended to be
the system design team has been
continuing their work on the usable
system as we've also recently discussed
uh they've also been working with the
cinematics team and helping to establish
the final look and feel that we'll have
for the conversation system and the
progress is going
good uh for the engine team we generally
discuss what they've been doing for the
procedural Tech and they've continued to
make great progress there but I thought
I'd dig a little bit deeper into a
couple areas this month so uh yeah here
goes we finally finished the physics
grid refactoring which is used to store
each individual physical object in the
world and to allow for fast neighbor
queries such as give me all the objects
within 10 m and it has all the bells and
whistles now active the old Legacy cry
physics grid system worked by projecting
the entire world onto a fixed 2D array
of Cs of uniform dimension for memory
reason the old system was configured to
huge cell sizes to allow for our massive
worlds which led to severe performance
problems when dealing with lots of small
objects as well as lots of entities
returned due to the fact that the grid
would wrap around every few thousand
kilometers uh to address these issues
the new grid system was designed to have
a sparse and fixed hierarchy of nested
3D grid cells of various sizes where
objects would get inserted into
different levels of the fixed hierarchy
depending on their size we can therefore
efficiently handle objects of the size
of a planet several thousand kilometers
in radius down to small Pebbles just a
few centimeters across initial
performance tests once it was in in the
Crusader have proven the new grid to be
vastly more efficient 10 times less
entities return for small queries and
queries in general faster in the
magnitude of 1.2 to few times while
using slightly more memory than our
Legacy
system on the animation front our lead
animation engineer Evo hereg has been
quizy busy for quite some time um he's
been building the core Foundation of our
AI movement I want to give you some
insight into his progress and give you
some examples of what he's been working
on most of our animations were motion
captured which is a perfect for perfect
solution for cutcenes and all types of
linear animations where things are fixed
and predictable but you can't use mocap
data directly for animations that need
to be truly
interactive uh like we'll have for both
the player and the AI to use the map
data in interactive situations we must
break down the longer motion clips into
shorter clips and generate multiple
variations of the same motion style as
an example for a simple walk cycle we
need walking at different speeds walking
in circles walking on slopes and walking
in different directions such as strafing
Etc a typical AI character in Squadron
might have about a thousand of these
small little motion Clips it's
impossible to create unique animation
clips for every single given situation
that's why we developed a blending
technique that we call parametric
blending which enables all these clips
to be controlled at
runtime parametric blending takes the
concept of simple animation blending and
moves it to the next level the goal is
to make the outcome of the transitions
or an interpolation predictable for an
undefined number of assets each motion
clip contains a combination of physical
and stylistic properties um we call
those the natural motion parameters
because they're inherently part of the
motion itself to control a character in
a game we want to pass these natural
motion parameters to the animation
system and let it generate the motion we
need itself once we have enough
animation Clips we put them into what we
call a blend
space the most important aspect of a
blend space is that each animation clip
represents a point in a coordinate
system and all points are connected by
an index list in a blend space we treat
blending as a geometrical problem the
geometrical relationship between the
animation clips
is extremely important for the blending
to work correctly and the placement of
these assets into the blend space is set
up so it's fully automatic due to how
the animators set up their locators
before they export their
animations in a single blend space we
can have more than a hundred unique
animation clips and we can control all
of them like a single
animation what you see here is an
example of a 2d blend space in this case
we put the travel speed on the X and the
turn speed on the Y we can move the red
cursor over the plane and for each
coordinate we get a blended motion with
the correct parameters this means we can
generate all motions between a slow walk
and a fast walk while maintaining the
correct turn
speeds in this test area we can move the
cursor in any place or Direction and
always get the correct Blended motions
back here's an example Le of parametric
starts and stops that lead in and out of
the Walk cycle you can see how a
character starts to walk in the
direction we select and then he walks it
at different speeds with different turn
angles and stops to the left right right
foot left foot
Etc uh blend spaces are not only limited
to simple motion Cycles uh they can be
used for most AI motions in our vast
Universe enabling our a AI characters to
move fluidly and realistically
throughout the entire world it's great
to see Evo's progress and it's
definitely going to have a strong impact
on our how our AI navigate around the
world the engine team also did
improvements uh to the objects blending
with terrain the underlying terrain and
object shapes are now taken into account
to blend procedurally distributed
objects more naturally with the
planetary generated environment and hope
to show you those improvements soon the
QA team here in Frankfurt grew by one
member this past month James Stevens our
new senior QA tester he immediately
stepped up and took charge of pioneering
the testing of the loadout editor the
load out editor is heavily used by our
devs across all four locations so it
only made sense for us to increase the
depth of testing we do for it on a daily
basis Melissa strata also spent some
time testing the first version of the
solar system editor also known as soled
the engineers went over Sol Ed's
functionality we gathered initial
feedback from the team uh QA was there
they documented all the feedback and now
they'll work closely with the engineers
to find the best way to address each
item um and how to test it and work with
them in the future to get all those
resolved they also supported the engine
team with testing of a few separate
things such as up ated Planet physics
grid and refactoring of the texture
streamer Logic the AI team this month
completed some work on Mission related
functionalities for both the Pu and
Squadron 42
designers they also worked on improving
the setup for complex conversation
scenarios where multiple characters need
to interact with one another the first
step to achieve this was to allow the
subsumption logic to run on top of the
players this allows us to execute some
Logic on the players on predefined story
scenes but also make sure that the AI
system can fully communicate with the
player and interact with them the
subsumption tool which you've heard a
lot about has also had some improvements
on the conversation setup and kicked off
work on what we call the conversation
sub activities the sub activities
describe the logic for multiple
characters in one view to make it easier
for designers to synchronize
interactions between the characters and
the
environment under the hood these
conversations will still result in
unique sub activities that will run on
different characters so that we can
still guarantee that each individual
entity can still handle further events
and situations uh on their own they also
completed the first pass on refactoring
of the perception for
spaceships we currently have a general
perception component on characters that
can handle several types of Senses
normal human will obviously have things
such as vision and hearing but once
sitting down inside a spaceship they'll
also be able to interface with that
spaceship's radar and the group
information about the different Senses
Into its perception component this will
now allow us uh allow us to progress
easily towards more character control
behaviors on spaceships since we're
moving strict dependencies between the
game code and specific behaviors running
on the vehicles
themselves cinematics team as always is
making steady progress uh across
multiple chapters this month uh some
implementing brand new scenes some
they're polishing existing ones as I
previously mentioned I unfortunately
can't show anything specific at the
moment without spoiling anything and
they'll all yell at me uh in the coming
months though we're hoping to show you a
few bits uh to really give you an idea
on the quality bar that we've Set uh
We've set the bar high for ourselves and
it'd be good to uh show that off and the
work that we're proud
of VFX team here in Frankford is
continued working on planetary effects
the systems for implementation have been
progressing nicely thanks to the close
collaboration between the VFX artists
and our Engineers here they started
implementing some of the new effects on
the planets including various atmosphere
and weather effects as well as more
specific effects for VAR types of assets
that will be distributed with the object
scattering system the Frankfurt
environment team has been primarily
focused on finalizing the
moons the procedural asset distribution
system has seen a lot of progress and is
still improving all the separate pieces
that make up our procedural planets and
moons
are truly starting to fall in place you
could say and things are looking great
so that wraps us up for Frankfurt thank
you for all the support that everyone
gives us on a daily basis the team
honestly truly really appreciates it and
I'll see you again
soon that look at parametric blending
really shows how creating something like
walking animation which sounds really
very simple is actually difficult to do
in an interactive Universe yes there is
a a lot of inovation involved in
developing new gaming tools but it's
worth it especially when you want to
create a detailed and realistic final
product as you may have heard the 262
update was released to the PTU we've
been receiving helpful feedback from
players which the team is using to fix
as many bugs as possible before it goes
live and as you probably saw in the
forums the latest patch includes an
addition to the Drake interplanetary
lineup the buccaneer we decided not to
announce the inclusion of the buccaneer
before the evocati release because we
weren't quite sure how the untested ship
would fly fortunately the Buccaneers
surpassed our expectations to celebrate
we're having a drake sale for the next
10 days you can get the buccaneer
dragonfly caterpillar and more speaking
of the buccaneer a while back Sandy
Gardner and Forest stefen premiered part
one of the ship pipeline featurette in
it the team followed the ship through
the first half of its production
pipeline to showcase the process each of
our ships takes to become flight ready
yeah and if you haven't seen it I highly
recommend going back and watching that
feature at to see how the buccaneer went
from concept art to basic white box
model and then back to the ship artist
for the gray box
phase well with the ship flight ready we
can now share the second part of the
ship pipeline feature app we're picking
up right where we left off with the gray
boxing and the buccaneer completed take
a
look last time we spoke about the white
box stage and the gray box stage since
then we've moved on to doing the final
art stage and what we call flight ready
stage and that's really where it's just
putting the extra polish into the ship
uh making sure not just that it flies
but that it flies how we want it to uh
not just that you can blow it up and
that takes damage but that it looks
fantastic when you do that it has the
right amount of Health uh its Shields
are working and soaking the amount of
damage that we're intending them to and
really just putting all the final
touches on the ship what we essentially
do is we finish off the surface of the
ship so we decide what materials uh any
of the geometry is going to be so if
we're going to go with a raw metal or a
painted metal we'll uh make sure we
create all the textures necessary for
each material so you know we have wire
textures um we'll go ahead and use uh
Palms which is a parallax occlusion
mapping texture it's basically a decal
which makes the surface looks like it
has a lot more detail geometry wise than
it actually does um and we'll use that
in order to add rivets to the surface
cut lines um onto the wings as an
example where no actual geometry exists
so it looks far more detailed geometry
wise than it actually is which makes it
more efficient to run an engine it uses
less resources but it looks great it
ends up looking like there's tons of
detail on the ship uh and it's actually
one of our favorite parts to start
working on once we get to that stage it
really is about detailing it and sort of
bringing the ship to life in terms of
the way it looks uh because we have a
lot of freedom as to how we make these
cut lines you know start dancing across
the ship without actually having to
affect the geometry in any significant
way we'll make sure during that stage
also to finalize all the animations so
we'll bring in Jay Brushwood in Texas in
order to finalize all that change the
timing on the animations if we need to
finally get to give my hands in and get
nitty-gritty in terms of setting up
pivots the hierarchy structure of the
ship and for those that you don't know
the hierarchy is basically a parent
child relationship uh for instance it's
like your hand being a child of your
forearm your forearm being a child of
your upper arm same thing deal on the
ship we've got all sorts of hierarchy
structures where things can Branch out
and do their own thing for instance with
the landing gear the foot of the landing
gear is going to be attached to the
ankle of the landing gear and then we
might have Pistons that you know uh go
in and out of each other and and that
allow the landing gear to fully retract
in and so anyway after setting up all
that uh I get the opportunity to go
ahead and work on the timing of the
animations and this is where you know
you actually add the bit of you know
flare with overlapping action and uh a
lot of other principles of animation of
of how things you know uh deploy and uh
the various parts of the ship that that
we end up uh setting up animations for
are things like the landing gear the
ladder entry the canopy opening and
closing all sorts of this stuff needs to
be worked out and then we export that
all to game and once it's exported to
game the next thing we do is we set up
the character interactions and this
would be the character climbing in and
out of the cockpit opening up a drawer
you know opening up a hatch uh all the
various things for me the whole process
is kind of building up puppet that I
then get to play with and the animation
part is where it comes to life and
that's where the illusion sort of comes
together this is also the stage when we
allow the VFX team to come in and start
doing all of their effects for thrusters
as an example so the difference between
the effects that you'll see on the the
buccaneer compared to other uh Drake
ships would be pretty much driven by
what that ship looks like and what the
function of that ship is compared to the
other ships uh I suppose the best
example is the the thrusters so the the
color scheme and the style of the
Thruster effects for the bucaneer
they're going to be sharing similarities
with the other Drake ships however the
thrusters are a specific shape on that
ship and the the thrusters actually
animate in a specific way to that ship
so that's going to drive what our
effects look like compared to the other
ones so the VFX pipeline itself um we
will have we will go to from the uh the
R&D to the blockout we then have the the
first pass which is the the artist's
first attempt to getting that effect as
as kind of good as it can get it and
then that will get reviewed uh we will
provide feedback from that review and
then it goes into the Polish pass so the
Polish pass is is once that's done and
once that's signed off and it's been
optimized as well um because that's a
big part of the getting the effects
finished in the game um then that's it
then the effects are done for that ship
and we consider it flight ready UI likes
to be involved with with kind of all
Milestones of of the pipeline from from
the gray box and the white box um Al B A
lot of the ships use the same UI style
um there's there's definitely quite a
few that uh will require unique screen
shapes and sizes we have a lot of great
upcoming ships that have very unique
bespoke uh designs on them so the
earlier we know about those designs that
the quicker we can start working on the
visual side of things um but as as for
the buccaneer and a lot of other ships
they uh quite a lot of them use the same
template system so UI can be kind of
hands off until the very end when it
when it came to doing the buccaneer
thankfully we had a very clean and
smooth pipeline introduced already so
plugging the new screens in was
instantaneous basically after after the
3D modelers came in um there's very few
customization that need to be done
eventually we want to have the Drake
ships have their own looking feel the
the Anvil ships everything kind of um
while they might have the same screen
sizes and Screen ratios we want them to
have their own unique colors and feel
and and different shape language our
audio production Nicola gr um takes care
of communication between our discipline
and the other disciplines we can see
that sort of large ships are coming down
the pipeline we can allocate time to
work on those smaller ships are going to
be going to require less time so the
smaller ships tend to wait until more
towards the end before we start working
on them but they all need to have the
same amount of emotional connection with
the
player um so for example with the Drake
craft we're looking at um you know the
lineage the The Herald the caterpillar
these other ships what they sounded like
and what they felt like to fly it's
quite different from the buccaneer the
buccaneer is far more kind of finessed
than say the herald the Herald's like a
can with the rocket strap to it I mean
it's it's like it's going to explode any
second and that's part of its charm you
know it's sort of agricultural and this
is a feeling we get from it but we can
only really tell that when the ship's
got all its decals and detail
and and stuff in situ and we can decide
what that that should sound
like here's the herald thrusters for a
quick
comparison so you can hear that engine
there it's Roar your strap to a rocket
and here's our
Buccaneer that's the Drake
sound
yeah the thrusters are made up of lots
and lots of layers and here's one of
them that gives it a very distinctive
tone as we Traverse the thrust range
here moving up towards maximum
thrust he the sound morphing and
changing in character right up to the
top and then back down again
that's kind of a synth layer in the
background giving it some
character so this synth element is just
one element of many that make up the
compound Thruster sound but look how
many real-time parameters are bound to
this single synth sound all of these
here are going to react to the player's
input to the ship controls and they all
change the pitch and the filtering and
the volume of the various Elements which
gives it a very organic feel you know as
one element rises in tone with a strain
on the ship another electronic Buzz
might fall in tone in a sympathetic way
and in turn that provides a very natural
interaction within the sounds and that's
exactly how we um give the ships more of
a voice a realistic flexible character
and this extends to even the ambient
sounds in the ship as well they all have
these real time parameters assigned to
them
taking the the lineage from the other
Drake ships and bringing it across to
the new ship is what we're trying to do
but also create something unique in the
new
ship it's not like a kit bash it's not
the sort of copy paste from an old ship
to a new ship it's about taking ideas
from those uh other Drake ships and
bringing them across into the new sound
design sessions for the for the
buccaneer but creating something um
unique in the process as well then the
last stage in the process for us on the
art side is the flight ready stage and
during this stage we are we are not
really focusing on what the ship looks
like anymore we've already sort of
finalize that but we are filling in some
of the gaps that are necessary for for a
game play to be fully fledged on the
ship so what that means is we need to
build damage I am involved in every ship
in the pipeline and and I get I jump in
about white box stage after concept's
done the modeling gets laid out design
has put some uh features in I'll go in
and I'll look at the what the design is
what's been done so far and uh start to
uh think about destruction very early on
we start to think about how the ship
will break apart so we'll talk about how
the meshes uh get divided very early and
in the case of the buccaneer uh Pat
handled the damage and the lighting
and I handled some of the optimization
work and what we did for optimization
was we uh do a process called skinning
and it's like rigging a character um
where you make several meshes a single
mesh which reduces draw calls which R
which improves performance and uh that
also needs to be hooked up through our
mannequin animation platform and driven
through uh say the thrust of the the
engine needs to dilate the nozzle of the
engine so I had to hook that up and um
the landing gear of the ship needs to uh
deploy and allow you to rest on a
platform and have proper collision and
materials and so I handle all that when
I get the ship from an artist the first
things I do are I start to set it up for
detachability um what that usually
entails is going to Max and the XML
setting up the variety of components
like the wings detaching and normally uh
in this stage we're getting this done so
design can start to Iron Out Health
values and how Parts break off and how
it affects the flyability of the ship so
before I even get into doing shaders and
effects and making it uh look pretty
just got to get it to work after I do
all the detachments I set off how the
pieces fly off the ship and those are
called vectors so when you blow off a
piece of Geo it's going to spin around
right and that's based on its pivot
point and then that's going to rotate
and then it's just going to go flying
off into space so I set up how that
works uh after that I also go into the
XML and I set up pieces that will detach
with other pieces so say for example you
blow off a big huge engine on the
buccaneer right but there's a Wing
attached to that there's also a Thruster
and maybe there's a little wing flap
behind it you ask yourself if the
explosion was big enough would it take
off these other pieces surrounding it so
shoot that and then you can have extra
pieces fly off with actual probability
so it's kind of random whether the
pieces fly off or not
uh that's actually just the sort of
damage setup phase I want to get into
making sure everything starts to look
appropriate when it breaks off uh that
involves getting ready for Shader damage
that we've added um we've talked about
that where we have the procedural damage
Shader which melts across the surface um
for that we needed to do what's called
uv2 setup and now um if you know UVS are
how your texture gets mapped onto the
surface of an object so in our game we
have two sets of UVS we have one set of
UV for the basic texture on your surface
of your ship and we have another set of
UVS for your damage map to melt and wear
across you're creating like a mesh that
closely resembles the shape of the
actual ship and from there it's kind of
trial and error actually there's really
no tried andrue methodology for it and
uh kind of working it out as we go
quality gets better as we keep going
through but that's a basic setup so now
what I'm doing is once I get into the
editor I've start to shoot the ship
right and I'm testing and I'm making
sure that there's two types of damage
happening there's a decal happening when
you shoot so a bullet hole will leave a
burn or a bullet ding but there's also
the Shader damage which should happen
around it now the Shader damage is works
for different weapon types so laser will
leave like a melty wear and a bullet
will leave an actual indent that has
metal as you keep shooting shooting
shooting you can tear a hole um as you
tear a hold the modelers have prepped it
so that there's internal damage before
Tech art can Implement any of the
damage we have to build it so we need to
actually generate the content that gets
revealed in in the damage process the
actual setup of it so we'll do internal
damage structure so this is like I
mentioned before this is where we build
the internal structure for the wings and
the body so that there's something there
to show and we will also do an initial
pass on what we call UV 2s essentially
it's just a second UV Channel which we
use to generate um procedurally on the
Fly um an alpha map which then tells the
engine where to reveal the damage on a
ship after I've done the UV 2s and I've
tweaked and it looks good and there's
lots of melting metal and all sorts of
fun stuff going on I move on to the
VFX um now there's multiple people
working on VFX I'm doing more
Preparatory VFX since I do the Shader
damage there's two parts to it there's
what's called squibs which are little
kind of explosive charges that create
Shader damage and radius I set the
radius and Max and then there's actual
particles like fire electricity smoke
explosions you name it right
now I don't actually build the particles
but what I do is I go into a library
where all the particles are held and I
start to set up all the pieces and I
pick effects and I put them where I
think things are exploding are there
tubes here maybe there should be gas is
there you know something like that um
after I set all that up and it looks
great and there's Parts flying around
and fire you know and smoke and stuff
then I send it to the actual particle
guys who then do an optimization pass
make sure that I'm using the correct
libraries and the very last final bit is
actually making sure that everything
detaches correctly right so when a piece
blows off does the gun go flying off
with it um artists will generally do the
lights on their ships so they'll do that
as part of the art pass and then um
we'll have the components so if a wing
flies off and there's lights on the wing
the lights should fly off with the wing
that's part of the setup pass right a
common sense but usually there's a bit
more set up to it than that so with
lighting there's two things we have
what's called prefabs for multi-light
which means that when a player gets in a
cockpit seat it then powers on all the
lights around him then we have what are
called object container lights which are
slightly different object containers in
new tech someone else will talk about
but uh basically when we have lights in
an object container they're always on so
we use these mainly for more interior
sometimes aesthetic lights that always
just need to maybe be on anything needs
power fits in a multilight I do all that
in the ship's setup level so that's kind
of post phase but that's the final phas
and from there it's polish right you
just shoot it make sure everything looks
good there's no bad UVS no parts hanging
on etc etc but for the most part that's
the tech art pass and then it goes off
to all the Departments for finalization
yeah one of the the interesting
challenges that always pops up as we're
finishing off a ship are sort of the the
random things it's like oh crap I can't
believe I forgot that or uh just chasing
down why something doesn't work for no
reason uh one of the more notorious
aspects of that is usually our Collision
um so we we're actually just getting the
landing gear in it all functions and
looks proper now but occasionally it
doesn't want to act like it's turned on
and so the ship can fall through the
ground and just blow itself up for no
reason right now I'm uh chasing up
several Loose Ends we've got some Shader
issues we got some texture issues so I'm
also chasing up issues with the Thruster
not delivering uh parameterized values
to our nozzle correctly and the glow on
the material that's inside the engine uh
these things will all be solved before
the the public finally sees it and it's
just getting those little Parts lined up
where it's like okay do we do we have to
adjust this helper to get that cleaned
up or do we have to adjust the landing
gear itself uh and sort of chasing down
almost to which discipline it's like
okay th this is going to be the cleanest
fix for our problem uh this is going to
be the best fix almost longterm for
making sure that uh if we have to do
something similar again it's like oh we
can refren or refer to this ship because
we fix that really clean there this way
and we can apply that to what ever other
ship you want to so I'm probably the
last step the last person to get hands
on with the ship um and that's kind of
an overlapping stage where test and
myself have a little back back and forth
when the ship comes to us and it's about
tweaking and taking what's already been
designed for and making sure that that's
the way it it is in game the process of
balancing it it's kind of you need to be
able to see how
um it's kind of like ranking it in in
with all the other ships really so being
able to see how all the other ships
compare to each other that's kind of my
job to make sure that nothing comes in
with with fly tuning in particular this
ship does not help perform where it
should be it doesn't it's not too fast
it's not too
maneuverable where it should sit right
where it should sit that's a it's a
difficult thing to get right and it's
often a lot of back and forth even now
with um with testers internally and
externally where they point out mistakes
or imperfections in the flight model of
the ship you know the sorry the flight
tuning of the ship it's um when it comes
to weapons it's kind of the same you
know you've got you we need to make sure
that the the ship load out isn't too
powerful when it comes to um dog
fighting against each other when it
comes to finding problems with imbalance
like with weapon Loadout for instance
it's up to me to to point that out to
the designer in charge of the ship see
if there's any leeway um the buccaneer
being another example of that with it
having a very large load out for weapons
you know it's it hits it hits really
hard it packs a punch I was concerned
about that that it may be overstepping
its um bounds a little bit in terms of
wider balance so that conversation we
had had it's um it's all about the
tradeoffs so if we can ensure that that
ship is weak but still hits hard and
that that's that's fine that's that's
[Music]
balanced I'm really not sure I'm
supposed to be talking to you guys about
this stuff uh we're not really going
into all the details of the company
right
now well there's something Shady
happening at Drake Enterprises that you
won't want to miss and that's it for
this episode of ATV we want to thank all
