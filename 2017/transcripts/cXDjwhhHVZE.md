hello and welcome to this week's episode
of bug slashers whoa
slashers yeah slashers when I run the
show its bug slasher smart
I don't think so
[Music]
welcome to bug smashers Spence what kind
of bug did you fix for me today so today
we're gonna be looking at a shopping bug
part of what I've been working on in the
last month is adding the new interaction
system to our shopping experience so you
can look at the shopping racks and buy
your clothing buy your ship items and
get the new highlighting and
interactions
however intentionally not all of these
interactions work to begin with ship
items worked but clothing and armor are
entirely different beast and so today we
talked about the physics of why that
isn't working
sounds like a fun little thing let's
take a look hello people of the internet
we've got a shopping bug today that I'd
like to walk you through so let me start
by showing it off if you've been
watching any of our recent ATVs and you
see me on here talking about shopping
we've gotten a new shopping interaction
system here so same old interaction
system we've had for some of the things
we've been introducing like carry ball
crates and stuff we are now putting in
shops so you can walk up to these
weapons on this play rack and you can
inspect them and you can buy them so
bring up over glass and i5u HD it sounds
like a realistic price for this gun
definitely not a test number or anything
cool so you could buy these feature I've
been working on recently but there has
been a bug that we have just washed
recently and I'd like to show you it so
if we leave this shop and we're gonna go
head over to casaba don't mind the guy
in the floor there he's doing just fine
okay so we're here in cassava and it
should be immediately obvious that we're
not getting the interaction highlighting
in items we can't even bring up the
different by or in Tryon prompts so this
may be one of the rare or depending on
who you ask not so rare occasions of an
intentional bug and I checked this code
in knowing that the shirts and any of
these clothing items were not going to
work with the interactions to begin with
there's a series of complicated reasons
why that is the case and I'd like to
start to break those down so I'm just
gonna hop over into our test map real
quickly so here we are in the code this
little bit here is entity component shop
so this is all of the stuff that exists
on our actual shopping entity in the
level and that's one function we're
looking here spawn item on first
available rack is where our issues begin
so there are two reasons why we're
having this no interaction bug here the
the first and broader reason is all of
the items on our racks all of the guns
all of the shirts and shoes anything you
go into a physical store and you see on
the rack is the actual item there so the
gun that you see on the wall you could
theoretically actually pick up and take
up off the wall and start shooting it
and this is very intentional because in
the future if we ever want to add like
stealing weapons off shop shelves and
stuff like that it's really cool to have
the actual weapon there whereas maybe in
a different game you might see that
there dummy items on the rack they're
not really you know the actual item they
just look like it that would simplify
some things but all our designers have
to go in and make dummy items for all
the things you actually want to sell so
we've chosen the route of using the
actual items there on the shelves cool
right so problem number two these items
were not built by the designers intended
to be used as we're using them now on
the shop shelves so they did not have
not all of them's had a physics setup
and not all of them had interaction
points setup now the reason the weapons
already worked with little to no effort
is they hand both of those already
but these shirts do not sow in our code
here you see this one little bit here
we're checking to see if this has an
interaction component if it doesn't the
item we're about to spawn we add an
interaction component so what we
actually need to do is do the same thing
for the physics controller so I've
already got a little bit of code here
that I'm just gonna paste in I'm gonna
uncomment this right so this is doing
the same thing as this but we're
checking to see if there's an
initializer for the physics controller
now there's a set of complicated reasons
why we need to do it this way but it's
important that we set the parameters to
have a physics controller initializer
before we even spawn the object which is
why we need to do it here right okay so
this is the first bit here we've got
physics great no problem right well now
we run into another issue which you see
in game development a lot because we're
adding the physics before the object is
actually spawned and we're doing it
through code we run into a problem
normally when the designer sets up
physics and data Forge there is this
physics component here and we choose
what kind of physics that would have so
rigid dummy static rigid to be like a
soccer ball static could be like a shelf
something that doesn't move we select
this as a way of sort of gating what
kind of interactions you could have with
this thing we want you to push it around
it needs to be rigid if we don't it
needs to be static the problem is this
is sort of locked in data Forge these
specific parameters for rigidness or
static Ness is something we don't
directly have access to in the code so
we have a problem if we look in our
entity physics controller there is
something important going on here every
physics controller has a physical Iser
the the physics system is a very
complicated system built on many
different layers and several different
moving parts working at the same time
but a physical Iser is just a small key
part of this and basically what it does
is you have a physics controller on the
game code side of things and it uses a
physical Iser
to set up the physical entity in the
physics side of the game code so we
don't need to go into the details of why
this happens like this but the short of
it is until now we've always needed a
physical Iser on objects and so you'll
see bits of the code where if we don't
have a physical Iser here if it's a null
then we're just gonna fatal error just
stop the game like we could never have
gotten here and funnily enough mark
abent happens to be the one who wrote
this code so it's funny that I'm doing
the bug smashers for it but we've
decided that we're going to get rid of
this we're still using the physical
answer but we're going to get rid of the
requirement that it is not null because
in actuality there's only one really
specific point where it definitely needs
to not be null and in the case here of
the shop items we can ignore that so
there's a couple lines of code that
we're going to change here scroll up
here
okay so in the beginning in the
initialization of our physics controller
we check to see if we've got this
physical either we know here that we
don't have it so we would hit this code
path where we fatal error we don't want
that we're going to turn that off and
one other small change that we're going
to do in the event that we did have no
physical Iser
we are just going to set our physical
ization mode to none just to be sure
because as I said the code can cope with
not having the physical Iser in most
cases so long as it knows your physical
ization modes not and then we're just
gonna hop over to one other file here so
now let's build these changes we made
and while we're waiting for the build to
happen when you just put this on screen
this is printing out status of our build
and while we're waiting for that to
happen let me recap what we've just done
I know I thrown a lot of at you of
physical eyes ears and physical ization
modes and it's all really nonsense here
but remember the reason we're doing this
is because these shop items that don't
have interactions and the reason they
don't have interactions because they
don't have physics you need physics for
the player to interact with things so
what we did was we ensured that if these
shop items got spawned without these
physics parameters that from dataforge
because remember their spawn through
code now if their responder code they
don't have these physics data for its
parameters that's okay they won't have a
physical Iser we'll just ignore that and
keep right on truckin and now we should
be able to get interactions on these
topics you know while we're waiting for
this build I think I'm gonna help myself
to some delicious snacks here don't
don't mind me
you deserve this mark abandoning bug
smashers mmm delicious
all right so we just got back on our
test map here and let's go see if the
changes we made are gonna work maybe you
try and buy some pants and hey all right
we got some highlighting there we can
buy we could try on whole nine yards and
it's gonna work for clothing too so
goodbye you can try on for our shirts
over here
anything anything except armor mm-hmm
now there's a whole different reason why
armor actually isn't working right now
but that's a bug for a separate day you
know what maybe I should go talk to mark
about this one so today we saw how the
physical eyes were can give the objects
in star citizen physics and further how
the shop needs to override this so the
shop items don't have a physical eyes
err that way you can properly interact
with them that was the way I slashed
this book anyways hope you guys enjoyed
this week's bug smashers until next time
thank you for watching I'm out I'm gonna
get some lunch
it took forever Oh kind of filled up on
snacks earlier but thank you for
watching so if you want to keep up with
the latest and greatest in star citizen
and squadron 42 development please

see you soon
you
