hello and welcome to round the verse our
weekly look at star citizens development
I'm Sean Tracy and I'm Josh Herman in
this episode we have a shipshape focus
on Aegis eclipse the newly Declassified
stealth bomber unveiled by the uee last
week but before that let's go to
Frankfurt for a studio
update hello everyone my name is Brian
Chambers and I'm the development
director of Frankfurt office of Foundry
42 this past month the team welcomed a
few new members bringing us up to a
total of now 74
employees we routinely have visitors to
the office and this month was no
exception with people here from both our
us and UK offices most of the senior
production staff uh from across all the
offices came together in one place for
their annual Summit had some intensive
meetings and discuss both ongoing and
upcoming plans and we found that a few
days face to face without distraction it
can actually go a long way so let's kick
off this month with checking in with the
AI team the AI team has worked on
numerous items uh over the past few
weeks and I'll just mention a few and
show you a few things uh they started a
Sprint focused on human combat with the
end goal of improving all the combat
work done in the previous months into
something that represents our final
quality they're initially focusing on
all the shooting functionalities making
sure the basic controls for accuracy and
friendly fire implemented correctly
they're also diving into uh the
improving the behaviors related to the
first initial reactions of something
non-friendly seen or heard from a wide
range of
distances they also finished converting
the ship AI to a newer updated version
meaning that weapons Shields and counter
measures now work with the new SC item
2.0 system for now it also supports the
old ships to avoid any compatibility
issues that may creep up this is part of
an ongoing effort to move ships away
from kythera AI Control and brings us
one step closer to fully switching to
subsumption based AI for all the shifts
both ship and vehicle seats can be
controlled by either players NPCs or an
AI module the past month the AI team did
some work on the AI modules uh the AI
module represents an item that can be
attached to a seat any seat of a
spaceship or tourret and execute a
behavior logic defined with a
subsumption editor you might think of it
as a piece of custom software that can
be instructed to take control of the
same items that are available to player
sitting in the same seat it might work
for example as an autopilot or
autonomously take control of a turret
and fired an enemy Target this features
crucial and multi- Cru ships where the
pilot might assign specific activities
to the AI modules instead of another
player
NPC the system design guys have been
pushing forward with the air traffic
control system adding conversations with
the traffic controller and a smart
system for allocating landing pads for
Pilots wanting to land or take off they
also updated all doors to version 2.0
which now makes them modular and a lot
easier to implement each door having
switchable loadouts ability to connect
two rooms so air can travel between them
and generally a lot more functionality
needed for new systems that are already
in the works such as breaching and and
hacking they also started reworking
locks so they can work better with the
room and Atmospheric
systems they did some rough prototyping
work on Dynamic Advertising which will
contextually fill in the in-game panels
and Screen throughout stations with
content that's reflecting the interests
of the player that enters its proximity
the same system could be used for
showing large scale broadcasts and
warnings throughout the Universe based
on what's happening in the game at that
specific moment moment either globally
or
locally our lead lighting artist Chris
has been continuing work on the surface
outposts particularly on the habitation
sets as well as keeping in sync with the
UK environment art team with all their
updates to assets and dressing one issue
lighting has been trying to solve for
3.0 is how to improve the amount of
visibility On the Dark Side of moons
previously without any interest objects
in the sky relying solely on Cube Maps
would mean that the planet's surface
would be visibly too dark and the player
really wouldn't be able to see any
detail in the environment around them so
Chris worked with the engineers to add
another layer of atmospheric glow in a
Radiance the glow allows us to brighten
the atmosphere given a nice gradient
that shows the shape of the Horizon and
gives some depth in front of the player
and the radiance uh gives us a base
level of brightness on the actual
surface geometry so the player can
faintly see themselves as well as the
surface around them finally he's also Al
been providing support for s42
environment lighting and helping set
visual benchmarks for each of the levels
the engine team recently implemented the
initial version of our new IO scheduler
this system will improve streaming
performance as textures meshes sounds
Etc are constantly being streamed in and
evicted based on what's being used to
stay within a certain memory budget
eventually it'll also allow the job
manager to better utilize CP U cores in
cases where streaming jobs are waiting
for Io moreover it lays the groundwork
for a version of the scheduler
specifically D designed for SSD drives
to exploit their Superior random dis
access properties that will allow for
multiple concurrent data streams with
high throughput all in all this ensures
all data is available in time for
complex scene surrender without having
to wait for lods and all the related
artifacts uh meanwhile the incremental
Patcher moved into an internal phase of
QA testing as previously discussed the
system is designed to deliver builds
incrementally to devs and Gamers alike
so every time you update the game you'll
only need to download what has actually
changed or been added since the last
time and this update process will
therefore be a lot lot faster we also
revived our internal memory analysis
tool for Linux uh called memory play
this was to help us find out and fix
memory leaks on server instances much
faster memory leaks are one of the
contributing factors for Server
stability and we want fixed as quick as
possible to make sure our servers can
run for a long long time without any
issues on the rendering side several
improvements have been made to the
atmosphere and night skies as I
mentioned in the lighting update the
night side of the planets and moons now
exhibit more details due to in scattered
Moonlight and a visible Sky gradient in
the distance when close to the terrain
surface we're also looking into
additional improvements for stronger
groundbased Haze to further increase
visual cues for scene readability and to
make our lighting artist happy they also
continued working on the object
container streaming Soul Ed as well as
plan Ed and rewrite of the living entity
code AS previously mentioned is on track
the environment our team continue to
work on the Leb ski exterior in
combination with the level designers
both Art and Design regularly work
closely together to verify that the art
that's being created is made in a way
that doesn't break any portion of the
design the last layout changes for left
ski are coming in and the set dressing
pass is close to being complete
[Music]
the area around leki is also being
populated with slightly larger mining
structures than what we previously had
since the lefki exterior is grown a lot
over the past few weeks it's also going
through an optimization pass with the
artists looking into reducing memory
consumption wherever applicable and
making each individual asset as
efficient as
[Music]
possible the terrain of Delmar is
getting polished up and both the assets
and rocks are all being finalized we're
also setting up the specific asset
scattering presets for the different
ecosystem systems to populate the
asteroids with defined
[Music]
objects the planet Tech has gotten a
couple of new features recently the
overall amount of materials that can be
used on the Trin has increased
significantly therefore new materials
are being created for the moons to make
the surfaces even more diverse from one
another along with that the moons also
got a performance boost by optimizing
which assets are being drawn in the
surface of the procedure entities at any
given time
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the tech art team worked on multiple
mannequin tasks including animations for
both usables and the cinematics team
mannequin is a tool within lumber yard
that allows us to construct complex
interactive character animations fairly
easy the they also refined some of the
earlier shown pipeline tools by adding
new features and fixing bugs to make
them easier to use and more dependable
they did a handful of additional things
such as prototyping Vandal weapon some
physical simulation R&D for weapons and
Bug fixes to name a few the VFX team in
Frankfurt has been continuing to work on
particles for the planet effects one of
the new features we recently implemented
are animated decals
this now allows us to project certain
animated textures on objects so it'll
follow the Contours of those objects
instead of having them on a flat plane
that is roughly aligned to the surface
this helps to integrate a certain
effects into the world a lot more
efficiently and with much better results
than what we could do previously the VFX
team in Frankfurt also grew by one
member this month he'll primarily be
focused on the large amount of
cinematics work that needs to be done
for squadron 42 including soft and rigid
body simulations as well as destruction
particle effects and the scene setups to
go along with those the QA team this
month grew by one member John Lang he
got up to speed fast and soon became a
primary point of contact for any Game
Dev client issues in Frankfurt ensuring
that he knows the current state of Game
Dev at any given time he's also been
heavily involved in various system
testing this month such such as a new
stamina system currently being worked on
in both Frankfurt and UK
offices together with Glenn Neil they
were able to begin the initial testing
pass in an effort to gather data for our
game programmers to use for bug fixes
and overall improvements to the
system QA teams also been working on
testing the Patcher itself the editor
server connections and the Star Citizen
client using the new pack system in
order to catch crashes and differences
between builds pulled with the old
Patcher versus the new Patcher it's an
ongoing test that they perform daily to
stay on top of any potential issues that
arise from build to build additionally
they also spent time testing various
multiplayer issues for the Stanton
system which included Moon Collision
testing they work extremely close with
the engineers and test very specific
things in a very specific way to get the
data that the engineers are after the
engineers then take those findings to
work out fixes for issues and to also
improve things such as stability and
potential memory issue this month the
FPS weapons team was primarily focused
on R&D efforts for weapon skins they
spent time prototyping camouflage
patterns decals and material
variations this will set us up for
future weapon customization and allow us
to quickly and easily create special
one-off variants when we
want the ship weapons artists are
currently working on the preacher armant
Distortion scatter gun S1 to S3 and
started work on the apocalypse arms
ballistic scatter gun S1 to S3 this past
month the cinematics team focused on
previous Pipeline with the goal of
getting most of the cinematics into the
game regardless of their current state
either polished or rough this will help
designers and director alike get a
better idea of the overall flow and
pacing for the full playthrough of
Squadron 42 within the next few weeks
they'll be working closely with facial
and audio team to get a full
representation of performances working
in engine they also spent some time
getting a small motion capture system
set up in one of our common areas with
help from Kyle Moody from the UK for
those that don't know motion capture or
map allows us to capture an actor's MO
itions then map them to a digital
character it's a way for us to quickly
generate a Bas animation for the
animators to then modify if they need we
set up 11 optit Track cameras in total
which gave us a small capture volume of
roughly 3 m squared the cinematics team
will primary primarily use it to capture
background characters for individual
scenes as well as transition animations
to help link animations that are not
quite aligning can also be used to
capture quick animations that we can use
for outstanding R&D tasks from our
animation engineers and save the
animator some time the system won't be
set up permanently but once we have a
small list of animations that we want
the team can set it up in about an hour
and quickly get what we need the game
programming team in Frankfurt has grown
over the past few months team is
currently at three people with one lead
and two
regulars this month they did a pass on
improving the functionality of doors
then started working on air locks both
the doors and air locks need to be set
up as simplified as much as possible and
integrated with the latest changes of
item 2.0 system they also added a few
small features to the weapons such as
the ability to have different muzzle
flash effects or different vent effects
based on the current fire mode as well
as fixed numerous bugs they also started
planning the work needed for the
improved weapons system this new system
is based on the item 2.0 system and will
allow the designers to create a wider
variety of weapons more easily it'll
also address technical issues such as
client side prediction and server
Authority it's still in the research
phase and it is a long-term effort
however we're confident that we're on
the right track and implementation can
begin within the next few
weeks so that wraps it up for Frankfurt
this month appreciate all the support
you enable us to do what we love to do
and I will be back next month with
another update see in the
verse a lot of interesting stuff in that
update imagine being stuck on the dark
side of a moon when they didn't add that
atmospheric glow uh it might be pretty
pretty realistic but not very good for
visibility yeah and that's a good
example of how game design works we
figure out a way for one sun to light an
entire system only to create this new
problem so considering how our the
environment and art teams work to make
this game look beautiful it' be a shame
if you couldn't see any of the textures
in that yeah exactly uh but let's talk
about something that's supposed to be
hard to see the agis eclipse mhm this
new stealth bomber has several great
features including different Wing
positions for atmospheric and space
flight here's a ship shape for more
details on this exciting new
ship my name is Paul Jones uh I'm one of
the art directors here at Foundry 42 I'm
Jeff from Tech design technical designer
that made the eclipse or made the spec
for the eclipse AES is meant to be one
of the older companies you know sort of
law basically generally sort of long
long sweeping lines you know quite clean
sort of body you know always well
thought out not gbly not like it's not
industrial you know there's a certain
level of clean industrial design that
have gone into these the eclipse was the
first chip I got to actually create in
Tech design so been in Tech design for
about a year now and I've picked up a
lot of other people's ships like the
Argo and the Idis but this was the first
ship I was given the design brief of we
want to make um a stealth bomber it
needs to like have Echoes of other ships
like the B2 bomber and then I just got
to sort of to run with it most people
have a certain idea in the head of what
a stealth bomber is and we haven't
really strayed far from that you know we
you know that's always the sort of way
in Star CTI and you know you often deal
with things that people familiar with
and then you advance it basically
originally sort of started with the
Avenger sort of sweeping lines basically
and then as we've developed kind of we
kind of shifted away from that and went
more towards a sort of you know saber
styling basically initially we I kind of
envisaged it being um a descendant of
the Avenger so it would have lots of the
similar tellings the Avenger the smooth
shape the um like the long profile but
as the the ship design went along the
ship became a bit more angular much like
the likes of the saber you know in the
sort of in the uh concept process you
know we we're starting with will we
start with a rough shape we then started
pushing towards uh sabber
styling and then it was you know it's
always really about that top profile
that sort of Delta cockpit and then your
intakes and so we've you know we started
off with the traditional two intakes and
then we sort of decided to sort of BCT
them and then have two intakes on the
top two intakes on the bottom see what
that does and then I was like okay I
don't like that so let's try four on the
four on the top which make you know a
real sort of striking feature of the
ship and then that was that was pretty
much it that was it that was kind of
like okay that's that's the one we're
going for cuz this is meant to be
stealth bomber of the future kind of
sort of felt it worked it worked better
to sort of push in that direction so
this even more so than the saber is
going to be a very stealthy vessel but
unlike the saber it's no dog fighter you
know we stuck fairly close to the brief
and you know we gave Chris's option of
you know slightly Wilder ones you know
ones that were sort of entering probably
more into Batman territory maybe
basically Chris is like oh know I like
you know like this one from there off we
go basically it's uh how can we take
something familiar how can we advance it
but still keep it recognizable the
eclipse is uh it's very much a military
ship I was looking at a lot of the
stealth Fighters obviously that exist uh
the B2 was a very heavy inspiration for
the design of the ship uh look just
looking at the the ship from the front
you have this clean profile where you've
got the wings and it just kind of bulbs
out of the body a bit and that's kind of
what I wanted to worko with the eclipse
cuz having it loaded with loads of bombs
and loads of guns dangling off it all
over the place it it wouldn't look
stealthy and in a way that minimalist
design is kind of menacing you know
you'll see the shape coming and you'll
know immediately what it is currently
the way stealth works is your ship has a
cross-section and that's kind of how
easy you are to detect and basically
yeah a lot of that's radar one of the
one of the guys in QA actually used to
play with the uh the Hornet ghost where
you could turn off load your systems
like you know your engines and you can
turn off your Shield generators and it
reduces loads of your signatures so much
that you can only detect it when you're
looking basically directly at it and
that was one of his favorite strategies
in Arena commander and that that's kind
of the sort of thing I was kind of
thinking of with with the eclipse is
when you're flying towards a Target if
you knowly where they are you fly
towards them and you go dark a bit you
know you'll turn off any systems you
don't need right now and then when you
get closer light everything up and try
and get them you know we've got a Bombay
that holds three torpedos their size N9
is the same as the
Retaliator um and while a lot of the
space on the interior Retaliator uh
occupied with its torpedo vaye in the
eclipse we had to kind of tone it down a
bit keep it a lot more compact so we've
uh We've created a new uh torpedo firing
mechanism basically which is just like a
it's like a tube inside the ship which
will have three Torpedoes inside it and
it'll fire one torpedo and then rotate
and you can fire another one and then
sort of also featuring in sort of
functionality adding to the ship partway
through the process so it's got multiple
configurations basically of the Wings
when the ship is uh um in atmosphere the
wings the wings actually sort of fall
back a bit and when it's in atmosphere
they'll fold out fully so it's got the
full flat profile and it's got a handful
of little fins to on the nose and
towards the back and they'll be popping
out basically and to give the guys that
it it flies better in atmosphere and if
we can we we'll definitely be giving it
that kind of um that kind of profile and
update but in space all this stuff's
going to pop back in and the wing is
going to tuck back a little bit um and
which should make its profile just
slightly smaller so it'll be slightly
harder to shoot slightly harder to
detect you know and then the other
defining feature was basically its
Landing State so it's very you know
we've it's quite a wide ship and so it
wasn't going to work for a lot of
Landing areas and so this basically kind
of riffs off a lot of what of the
military do anyway on like aircraft
carriers so we've got folding Wings it
isn't you know it isn't quite they don't
fold over as far as military we've kept
you know we've gone for a very certain
sort of graphic style cuts a very
noticeable sort of silhouette and then
the landing gear is sort of part of the
folded Wings it's one of those that like
it's going to have a niche it's
definitely not going to be you know
you're not going to you're not going to
have it like a hornet and take it
basically anywhere and see what you can
do if you take this off fighting regular
Pirates near a station you wasting your
time cuz those size n Torpedoes are
going to take forever in a day to hit
they're going to take forever to lock on
you've only got two size two guns and
this ship doesn't it doesn't like it can
dog fight at a pinch but it's no dog
fighter it's one of the key things I
kind of wanted to stress is it's kind of
not so much ponderous but definitely
it's not agile but then if you do know
where a big Target is if you can get a
constellation on its own you can kill it
it's going to be a really cool ship to
watch sort of just come in and then
Wings fold up and then it sit on the
ground so looks really intimidating
which is kind of what we were driving
for what you want is a stealth bomber
isn't it you want something that's going
to cause trouble and look like it
too great work guys if you want to add
this stealth ship to your Fleet the agis
eclipse is on sale until Friday June 2nd
