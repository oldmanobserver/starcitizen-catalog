## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
gardner and i'm chris roberts yes and on
today's show we open the canopy and
climb into the pilot seat to check out
all the changes being made to cockpits
so stick around to see the latest
enhancements to the flying experience
yes but first as you all know the ever
cuts you got their hands on 3-0 last
week and ever since they've been busy
reporting issues and helping us track
down various blockers as well as
allowing us to focus on areas to
optimize so the team has been poring
over their feedback and thanks to our
new Delta patch oh we've been able to
easily release fixes an issue of data
builds almost every single day which is
pretty cool thing so let's see how this
expanded team of testers as affected
this week's burn down welcome back to
burn down our weekly show dedicated to
reviewing progress on issues blocking
the release of star citizen alpha 3.0
we've not only been delivering updated
3.0 builds almost daily to our evocati
testers we've also begun closing down
necessary bugs and tests to improve our
cargo and shopping experience so let's
see how the team is progressing
mccartey on Thursday for the first
portraits is really really good so thank
you to everyone that was involved with
making that what it was we also put out
another update on Friday as well with
some further vital fixes the main ones
being there was a a physics fix to try
and help the performance and also an
update to the crash handler so to
actually start getting crashing the
reports back because it wasn't working
previously the new patch er meant that
people were getting their their update
anywhere between like 30 seconds five
minutes depending on internet connection
so they need patter is really really
going down well with the community they
are loving not having to download 20 gig
at a time every single time one of the
reasons that we've been able to push
every day and it's been so successful is
because of the Delta patcher and what
that means is that instead of having to
redownload entire pack files we can just
download what's changed and so this has
brought the patching time down from
hours in some cases to minutes one of
the other advantages of the Delta
patcher is that we can actually
downgrade builds as quickly as we
upgrade to them so if we put out a build
and there's something spectacularly
wrong we didn't catch in testing we can
just roll back to the previous version
and then find out what what was what was
wrong
the main focus lately has been on
performance bushings specifically
requests from Chris Bolton usually what
all happened is we will be getting a QA
TR or a test request from Chris to say
he's putting some new code or he's
changed some things up to help improve
the performance of staunton system and
what we'll do is we'll grab his latest
binaries and put those into the latest
build we have and start doing usually a
full-blown barrage of tests on
everything
so that being like Stanton that'll be in
the other sections as well but
specifically statins which has been
struggling lately especially with the
Rings and paralysis the performance when
24 players go crazy on the server
this is something
which internally we have struggled to
always reproduce the reload of Soviet
system and then exactly this feedback
loop I think and a finger player we had
like 200 entities active and 16 players
just joined so all of our players we had
like 500 entities active now I looked at
the server from a vacati he was 24
players playing for some time we have
5000 entities active residing in a not
optimized friend rate and this is
basically is a fun for the next few
weeks to actually figure out why we
update so many entities do we need to
update them what is actually necessary
and we need to do more testing with 24
actually players but it's not really
practical to have 24 players constantly
testing all the game when especially if
you want to have more players in a
server just in much number if you
actually managed to get thousand players
and a server we cannot have thought 1000
craigers playing the game 8 hours a day
this it's not really reasonable
once we figured out the last 10,001
disconnect issue we've got a build here
from the UK that just deployed from that
was kicked off earlier this afternoon
that should the fixes for the
disconnects seem like they've taken we
could get another code build done or a
full build if we absolutely needed to go
through the process of putting out to
the evocati so that we can get them
those fixes rolled out to them today
which is good but it's important to
feedback is filtered through Todd and
we'll make priority calls ahead because
there's some stuff like you know ten
thousand and one error codes yes we're
definitely fit with definitely fixing
but then you know there's some
subjective feedback there like I don't
like this so I do like this or whatever
now some of those issues that calling
out we already know about already
working at addressing I always get a bit
worried because first of all we're
getting kind of subjective feedback that
sort of anecdotal and so you know
someone can have a strong opinion but
you know that could be their opinion and
it may be different someone else's
opinion else was broken up so it needs
to go through the filter of us on the
very high level of the kind of design
side to make sure that you know it's
something that we want to agree because
a lot of times people can't see the big
picture when they're making you know
feedback because they don't know whether
you know what it's missing I need this
and we're like yeah no we know it's
missing it's kind of like on our task
list we're working on it right now and
we understand that yeah it hurts your
ability is don't fight if you can't see
the status of your target or the status
of your so so I just want to make
sure we do that I'm a little worried
that like we automated suddenly these
subjective feedback get written up as a
JIRA to get put in someone's book here
maybe they get assigned and you know
it's like we'll spend some time working
on stuff that needs to have kind of
direction and
or priority called out and sometimes
what people want to get fixed the
solution is somewhere else
to fix the issue that complaining about
so on the subjective stuff I kind of
want to make sure that so one of the
best things about having their vacati
testing the bills with us is that
suddenly we have this testbed of 800
people on top of the people that we
employ here and it means that the number
of issues that we can test and the
stress that we can put on the servers
goes through the roof and that really
helps putting the pressure on the
servers that needs to be done and also
if when we get to the stage where we are
you're looking at where they were going
to go I'll be nice and there what stuff
is fixed today today as well yeah when
they produc new features would that be
good and then capacity will in those
guys because they needed to tell people
though I have no idea
yep I think it's Tuesday's basically I
think moving forward um Tuesday's will
incorporate the live sink within the
director sink and P will have to go
first
and people lastly listening to that kind
of stuff and then that will be the way
that Tuesday's has to kind of run
and test is instead of 70 testers and we
should be looking to deliver a build
every day if we can to them because we
have a delta function but the key is not
so much about oh we've got this one
blocker right there's a crash here or a
deadlock yes I which was sort of the
approach we were taking in like getting
it to every party the key is like okay
like what bits of the things we've still
left to do have gone into this gun in
Monday what I've got in Tuesday because
I don't want to just only have like one
blocker fix right because we've got
people finishing content yeah doing
lighting you know okay we you know if
these these three areas now being lit
are they funny as this is now being
brought over to light for 2.0 as you've
got it that's kind of think that's what
we actually want to do is have a steady
stream of you know things that are
getting like finished off or fixed up
putting in and one okay here's another
Cuddy here's the things that have gone
in that we think we fix because you're
basically you've just got to sort of
manage that over time so we've got to
get into that mode as opposed to me you
know what three boats do we have to fix
before we can
so the next steps for us here in cig is
we're focusing on the shopping feature
shopping and commodities as as a feature
to present to the car to say this is now
in a state where you guys can just go
nuts
go ahead buy sell do whatever you want
or fixing bugs left and right we've got
issues where certain clothing eye
clothing and items aren't showing up in
the shops right there's issues where you
can't interact with an item through a
glass case because the glass is getting
in the way with the interaction system
so we're trying to figure that out
and we're trying to also work out some
kinks with the Tryon mode where when you
look to inspect a item like a ship
component or something the character
will look around like he's got look got
gloves on and he's looking at his glove
so like we're just ironing out kinks
getting everything working really well
so right now I'm focusing on a suite of
different shopping related bugs and
features that were trying to push out to
the evocati soon today a couple of them
are focused on the weapons being
attached to the item ports on the
shelves so we've got trying out a weapon
in the shop drops it under the floor for
remote players weapon models disappear
after inspecting them these are the
great kind of bugs because they are not
100% repro so they only happens
sometimes which are always the best to
find and solve so what we've done is
we've taken our top issues we want to
get fixed these are a collection of bugs
and tasks we've gathered those together
we've put them into the evocati fixed
version in our internal JIRA tracking
software and this is where we saw the
burndown graph come from last time so
when you see this report go out you'll
see the the new list of numbers also the
new total number so as you'd expect
we're seeing new issues daily from our
influx of additional testers that we're
fixing immediately in order to improve
this release and at the time of filming
this we're at 23 must fix issues so come
back next week to see how we're doing
and to keep a close eye on the in depth
details of the last remaining issues
blocking the official SC alpha 3.0
release here on burned-down
tune in next week to see how much
progress we've made on the avvocato
release you can explore more details
about what we've accomplished by
checking out the production schedule
report on our website yes so now let's
turn our attention to this week's
feature so players are going to be
spending a lot of time in the cockpit of
their ship so it was really important
for us to make sure it was as visceral
and engaging as possible some elements
like the player suffering a readout due
to excessive g-forces are already in the
game but we always knew we wanted to do
more so we kicked off a series of
Sprint's focused on the cockpit
experience for you in star citizen and
in squadron 42 these improvements
involve designers animators VFX artists
and many other disciplines across the
company since the changes would utilize
a lot of our new tech like the actor
status system item 2.0 and other
recently implemented systems yeah so
let's check out what changes are coming
to your ships cockpit in this week's
feature
so the origin the cockpit experience
sprint was started with Chris taking a
look at the overall experience of the
player within a ship cockpit and wanting
to make that experience as visceral as
possible he looked at looked at of
sights and sounds and effects and just
the overall feeling of it and wanting to
make it real really feel special and so
we all kind of got together and and
brainstorm different things that we
wanted to see Chris laid out his
expectations and then John crew lead
tech designer there in the UK and I
partnered up to make this happen so John
and I sat down and outlined Chris's
goals into a sport called a sprint
breakdown so we we started with okay
here's our expectation for the first
sprint then the next sprint the next
sprint you know the in a sprint can be
two weeks long two to three weeks
usually around two weeks long and we've
started with you know just what is it
what does it feel like to be in a
cockpit flying around and so we
partnered up with animation lead ship
animator Jay brushwood in Austin and we
partnered up with audio team with visual
effects engineering to make this just an
overall amazing experience walls and fly
on the ship we got our design laying out
the expectations specifically breaking
down the tasks based on the high level
direction from Chris you know that
included things like g-forces updated
g-forces and how does that feel hit
reactions in the cockpit so when
someone's shooting and firing you're not
just standing there static but you're
actually reacting to the to the to the
hits of the ship and then what happens
inside that cockpit whenever you are
getting hit by another ship so we have
actual effects that play in the ship
cockpit you know air air decompression
and in flames sometimes and the lighting
changes depending on you know whether
you're just in default mode if you have
auxilary power running or if you're in
an emergency state you know it's time to
get out it's time to eject so we
definitely wanted to make that feel real
and as if you were actually in danger
at first we focused on just one cockpit
type so we took the Gladius as a kid as
a test-case
which uses our specific cockpit type
work on the HOTAS CL
and there are seven or eight ships that
use that cockpit type and we saw we
focused just on those seven or eight
ships and to make those really feel
special so what we did was we took the
Gladius cockpit it would say okay how
can we change the interior of this
cockpit to make it look really look make
it feel and look different to the
expectations that Chris is looking for
so we actually shifted the the seat a
little bit we have we changed the
positioning of the of the throttle and
enjoy stick we adjusted the position of
the of the front weapon ship weapon so
that when you're firing the weapon you
can actually see the muzzle from where
you're sitting in the cockpit and as a
result you see them the muzzle effects
as well
so not only are you seeing what's going
on inside your cockpit but you can
actually see the effects of of when
you're firing your weapon and stuff as
well it's a it's a huge ongoing process
we've obviously got so many ships that
we just can't do everything we want to
do with them all in one release 43.0
we're starting with what we call the who
tests CL ships which is an animation
template so that's Gladius Buccaneer
Harald Cutlass saber Vanguard and there
they're all getting a range of
improvements to the cockpit which will
hopefully make the overall experience
much more enjoyable in previous versions
of the game we had no visual cues on
whether your vehicle was damaged or not
we only had a simple implementation
where we had some damage effects playing
when your ship was about to explode but
that was very simple and not very
informative so we wanted to represent
different stages of being damaged so
slightly damaged Indian damaged heavy
damage and we also wanted to inform
player that their vehicle is actually
being shot at this very moment so we
created some the effects such as sparks
smoke fire like the breed charges and
things like that so whenever your
vehicles are being hit you will
see some effects playing also depending
on the health level of your vehicle it
will see more or less of these kind of
damage effects so we took these effects
I kind of place them manually and using
basic implementation we incorporated
that in the game to see whether it works
whether it's giving enough information
for the player and because it does we'll
take it
a level further we'll create like a
proper implementation of that so the
improvements first up we're tying in the
actor status system so you've seen that
with all the the breathing and stamina
that's now tied into the g-force system
from the ship's
so as you suffer g-force from your
actions in the ship it causes stress
which builds up stamina makes you
consume more oxygen it actually changes
your breathing in the ship's so you get
all the like you see fighter pilots have
to do various breathing techniques to
manage their breathing under high
g-forces you're pulling high g-forces
you're going to hear that physical
change on on your character if you ever
got to the state where you were pulling
so much g-force and you suddenly got out
of the ship you you would feel that
stamina effects you're not instantly
getting at the ship back at full full
stamina you're paying the price for your
actions previously another aspect is
ensuring the UI screens on the cockpits
are very consistent and minimum size on
screen because a lot of our cockpits
were done two three years ago and the UI
is significantly changed with 3.0 and we
need to make sure there's a minimum
amount of screen space dedicated to
these UI elements so you can actually
read them without having to zoom in
because there's lots of issues with some
ships way to sort of to read them you
have to zoom all the way in to read the
text which in the middle of combat it's
not something ideal so we've got
templates for all the screens going
across those that's why you'll have seen
in previous atvs things like the Gladius
cockpit screens have changed they were
way too small to be visible so he
brought them closer to the player made
them larger we've angled them in
towards the player to reduce reflections
and added more of them we're also
bringing back the combat visor interface
which you see up on the top left and top
right of your screen so you can have
there essentially support screens so you
could move information from your support
screens up to those if you want but by
default they're your self status and the
target or pin target status so you can
get an overview of those another thing
is we've worked with the animation team
about the poses in the cockpits so
across all of our 60 plus ships we have
about six to ten different poses so
every ship fits one of those poses
there's a few that are unique like the
NOx but pretty much every other one is
used across multiple ships which
dictates the throttle seat control or
yoke status as well as a range where
they can interact with within the
cockpit so over time we've picked
templates for certain ships model the
ships around those as we found they
they've been adhered to in various
levels of accuracy so you'll find one
ship had the template put in when the
artist was modeling their way they
thought well maybe if I move the
joystick one centimeter to the left that
that looks better in this cockpit which
it's fine the iocai solution can deal
with that but then what happened was the
next artist came along and went well
that ship uses that template so I will
use that template that they've got in
that ship so I'll take their geometry oh
but this is actually move like if I move
this another centimeter to the left it
fits this ship better so over time some
of the joysticks have got further and
further away from the player so when you
get in the seats and the animation plays
which is the same animation of grabbing
they're grabbing the sticks you get this
horrible snap where they go to the
actual poses so for those ships earlier
they listed we've redone all the
controls they've all come back to the
default position which we actually
change so every ship had to change to
match it because what we're decided was
the template actually wasn't
as good as it could be so all the ships
have of their joystick certain throttles
changed slightly
they've all been remodeled to fit the
hands better they've all got buttons on
the on the control input so we've got
enough geometry and animations to play
with for firing your guns you can move
buttons on it using afterburner or boost
you can use buttons on the on the sticks
we've gone through all the screens which
are now larger they now all have buttons
on there so all the future actions will
be interacting with the cockpit have
have space one of Chris's goals was
someone that only knows how to use
interaction mode can sit in the cockpit
and just use that to work out what
everything does in the ship so they'll
be able to go into interaction mode and
work out how to turn the ship on just by
looking around the ship looking at the
buttons the highlight looking at the
feedback they get and be able to do
everything from that primarily what the
animators are doing is we're working on
you know tuning in the GeForce
experience so it feels properly where
the camera sits in the cockpit in
relation to you know where you see all
your UI and stuff like that
finalizing of finger poses adding in you
know idols and you know kind of fidgets
you know and anything that kind of you
know can breathe life to the cockpit I
mean it's something that that we've been
focused on over the last three or four
months and there's still more work to do
there's always room for improvement but
I think for the three over lease we're
gonna be at a healthy spot that'll give
a lot of players some satisfaction
flying around we're improving our
technology and we're improving the the
animations that we're doing but we're
also putting in these systems that can
rely on the overall health state of the
ship so you know the UK programming team
have implemented hit reaction animations
that happen based off of what direction
you're getting hit from from all six
axes and they they blend together and
basically you get jostle around
in the cockpit on the direction that
you're going and that gets overlaid on
top of the character animating his hands
and you know throttle and joystick and
in addition to that the the overall
posing fighting of g-forces that we have
for the third-person so it's kind of a
culmination of a lot of different things
there is like a lot of Technology
overlap between animation and design and
and the programming team you know to get
the overall desired effect and you know
we have review gate meetings where we we
all take a look at it look for ways to
improve it think about new features like
oh and maybe your health the healthier
ship gets to you know a certain
percentage then the red lights start
blinking there's fires going on there's
sparks flying
you know emergency lights are going and
and then that way you know you have to
you know hit the eject button the
g-force animations and the blend spaces
we're using are all hooked into the ifcs
system that that drives the ship so
we're using actual g-force simulations
that that results in a blended animation
state for a particular set of g-forces
coming from X Y & Z the objective is to
make it feel like a living breathing
vehicle it's not just you you press a
random button on your keyboard or HOTAS
and stuff happens it's that's tied to a
specific action which will have a in
game reaction to that so you press the
engine on button in the cockpit roll
move and rotate and long term your
character will go out and interact with
that automatically to do that when you
press the button so you your finger will
reach out and touch it
twist it whatever the button is the
first step is getting all those buttons
mapped out in the cockpit and
interactive the next step is those
buttons animating themselves so you do
the action in interaction mode or you
press the shortcut key you see a
physical reaction for
those things and then the final step is
the whole player leaning out touching it
which is another reason why we've had to
adjust all the cockpit screens so
they're all within arm's reach of you
because we don't want the player to you
press a shortcut key whilst you're
flying to change something you don't
want your character leaning forward bent
double trying to reach a button that was
too far away because that's just going
to it's going to mess with your view
it's going to be unpleasant to deal with
on top of the animation unification
we've also changed how enslavement
process works between seats and players
which massively simplifies setup across
the board so when you sat in a seat that
allows you to do other actions that you
could do standing up so for instance you
it instantly allows you to do upper body
animations that are set up anywhere else
you don't have to set up say for the
Gladius and the moat for saluting that
would have had to be a Gladius specific
emote whereas now we can have a hotel a
moat that works across all those ships
in probably and in fact across all of
them so the actor enslavement has
changed which is great so we've had a
lot of new kind of technology in place
specifically for the cockpit to make it
make you feel a lot more visceral
Romulan Espinosa is one of our gameplay
programmers in the UK has been a really
huge help with that changing kind of the
way the seats are set up the way the the
I K and the in the arms work so that you
can have a little bit more reach and and
and things like that so you know there's
been a lot of different new features
developed just for this sprint that
enable the artists and the animators and
the visual effects artists to make their
stuff look as great as possible and feel
as great as good as possible for the
experience we had to implement on
different type of enslavement so what we
were doing before this new enslavement
we were using the old one so for the old
one what we had was to a TVs and DVD
system animation database with all the
animations we use for
entity so in the old enslavement we had
one for the vehicle one for the city and
then all the animation animations were
being put there other point with that is
we were deactivating the player
basically so was the seed who was saying
I need you to play this animation which
is stored on my database but in this
case that's for our project that's
madness because if you need any
animations on the animation on the
player you need to copy those animations
into this if you need to play image you
need to fire your weapon while you are
seated or whatever you need to add all
those animations into every single adv
and we have a bunch of advs one for seed
per C so it's impossible so we created
this new statement which is the city is
still in charge is who says I want you
to play this animation but the player is
still active so the player itself can
play animations so we don't need anymore
to add those animations into every
single ADB we just say I want you to
play this animation player and because
it's not you it's up to you to play it
so the player is just gonna do it you
have two options really you can just
leave the player to the seed or on the
other way around but in this case the
seed can move or we have these
animations with the canopy opening and
stuff like that so you want the player
to move accordingly to the seed and not
only our way around we don't want the
player to stand up and then they see
move or wherever what you want is you
want to move the seed and then the
player react according to that movement
so that's why we enslaved the player to
the seed and not only other way around
another part of the sprint is setting
the setting of the light group and like
group transitions for cockpits so it's
something we've had in multi-crew ships
is the damaged States the effects and
lighting triggers so when your ship is
damaged you have all this cool the
effects and lighting of the ship in a
motorcy state but we never really had
that on the single-seaters so we've
started
that in those ships so rather than just
purely relying on the UI element telling
you you're your low end health which
when you don't have the CBI in two six
three is incredibly hard to tell where
you now have you've got the cockpit
lights flashing red we've got all the
damage effects smoke flames coming in
the cockpit so it really does hammer at
home what state your ship is in and then
when you repair it all goes away it's
all goes backwards and forwards for the
cockpit experience for the VFX team is
more about the damage specifically
directional feeling of the damage so
currently in the game we do have
interior damage but it's more it's not
really a directional so you don't really
get a proper sense of where the attack
is coming from all the VFX are coming
from the cockpit model itself we are not
creating the cockpit we are taking
whatever is being created and we are
making sense out of it
so you won't see random effects coming
from random places it is thinking about
what would happen like what devices are
on in the cockpit and what type of
destruction you would see in an actual
vehicle of that type there's a lot of
thought put into into that placement of
effects has to be done manually so each
vehicle has a different cockpit so I
need to manually place these effects so
it makes sense we don't want for example
fire coming of a fire extinguisher
unless it's made in UK but that's a
whole nother story
so yeah the placement is done manually
but we are creating like library of
effects so I can use the same effects I
made for ladies on another vehicle but
it will look different just because the
the context is different these VFX are
coming from different objects and
locations so it is making a huge
difference when you're in the cockpit
the type of effects you're gonna see
will be Sparks smoke nothing that's
gonna be to kind of in your face so you
can't see where you go in because you're
not going to want that necessary
unless you really are in big trouble and
that is new compared to what we
currently go in the game
currently in the game it's either the
damages either on or off really so you
don't really get a sense of where
anything's coming from so for the
cockpit experience we are we we always
try to give the player more feedback so
we decided to create like different
blend spaces for hit reactions and pass
out and wake up animations so basically
blendspace is just it's an asset that
allows us to have any number of
animations blend between them according
to different input so for instance if I
pass out and I want to give the player
like different impulses according to the
g-forces
we cannot just create 100 animations we
can have like ten different animations
or maybe five different animations and
according to the input in this case the
g-forces we can play we can blend
between those assets and they are really
nice animation in between them so we did
that for the pass out and wake up and
for the he reaction is the same thing so
in that case the input are the distance
of the impact from the ship and then
there's hope
heavy is the thing that is impacting the
ship so it's not the same to be on a
Gladius and someone throw you a fork or
throwing you one of the big-ass missiles
so we needed some kind of different
animations to give the player some kind
of feedback for the impacts apart from
that we worked on animation driven 9k
animation driven okay we have two
different systems in place one is the
limb by K and the other one is the
animation to you and I K the base for
both is the same thing but the way they
are activated is different so for the
animation driven NK is the animator who
says I want to use AI K at this point in
animation I don't want to use this okay
what is that gave for so when you try to
read an object or in this case for the
cop
but the throttle logistic or maybe the
steam will because the those objects are
moving we need their hands to move with
them otherwise you will see some kind of
delay that you can see in other games so
that's why with this idea we can like
put together like glue together the
hands on those objects and that's why
the animation driven I guess for bulimia
is the same thing but we activated in
code before the official sprint kicked
off we did about 2-3 weeks with myself J
and VFX guys just going over various
alterations so we picked Gladius as the
test case because it's used by far the
most in squadrons so you're going to be
sat in there for a long period of time
so it needs to be something that's good
and an easy place to understand so we
went through so many iterations of is
this seat in the right place move the
seat up-down left-right backwards
forwards move the screens forwards move
the canopy bars around move with the
buttons we had a list of 2025 actions
that we knew we would need in every
single cockpit so that's that's in the
new guidelines and then there's about
another 10 15 that need to go on the
control input so either you stick and
throttle yoke or any combination of
those things we've built more in for
redundancy so anything in the future
that needs an action that currently
doesn't we've got space to do we don't
need to go back and read it all again
there was a lot of backwards and
forwards with multiple departments on
getting to where we are most we could do
this with the the old item 1.0 ships it
would have been a huge amount of sort of
throwaway work so whilst we were we were
in the process of doing the conversion
to 2.0 as we started doing this this
sprint sort of managed to tie them both
in together but with item 2 below makes
it all incredibly quick and you set out
for one ship it's it takes minutes to to
set it up on the next ship rather than
hours or days having to manually
duplicate everything
would have had to have done before I
think that the most challenging thing
was the the amount of ships that we have
to deal with because there was some
pretty big decisions we had to make
what's doing it knowing that if we
change this template that means we have
to go revisit 1015 ships and it's
guessing or the directors and leads on
board and agreeing that as they if we do
this it's it's a big change your
department can have to see lots of work
but it unifies everything nicely and in
the future any changes that we have to
do automatically happen across all ships
you don't have to do that change 15
times anymore you do it once and it it
just works but it means you don't get to
work on these other cool features so
it's no one likes going back and feeling
like they're redoing stuff but sometimes
you just have to bite the bullet and
revisit what you've done to make things
better for the future in our game
getting to a seed is not just I press a
button and I get in there no we need to
move the ladder we need to open the
canopy we need to move the dashboard we
need to move the seed we need to take a
seat we need to push some buttons all
the sequence you need the player to be
enslaved and I think that's the most
difficult thing in our game which is do
you play all that sequence and still
don't lose control of the entire
sequence and the entire thing and I
think that was quite challenging is the
animation driven I K we had to basically
reward the entire thing that we were
using for animations we had to basically
reinvent all the the way we were
processing all the animations in order
to get rid of that one frame delay we
were having so basically we were having
an object we were having our hand we
were trying to reach this object so
basically the hand was always behind
because this object this pan was moving
first but then the object so we were
always one frame behind but in the case
of these new animations even I K after
our changes what happens now is because
I'm enslaved my
and is kind of enslaved to this object
I'm gonna leave the object to move first
and then without up-to-date position
when I move the hand and then we are in
sync all the time in this case was kind
of a broad force a gigantic email
between all the clever people chris
Roberts
evil Jen's Balti everyone in the company
was trying to get these things right
because this disco has been there
forever but if we break this code
nothing is gonna work in the game
absolutely nothing and everything is
going to break mannequins and I've been
to war the character - it's not going to
work da leaders never into war of course
the game is not going to work so the
plan for right now is to release the
various features as part of the khakhra
experience in chunks or phases so the
changes we're making on the cockpit
experience sprint or were things that
were always kind of in the work so we're
always planned to have happened really
it's been Chris's vision from the very
beginning but because it was it required
so much attention from so many different
teams across the whole project there was
never a considerable focused effort
between all those people at the same
time to make it happen and so really
what it took this this kind of gathering
of people coordinating everything that
everyone into a sprint structure to get
everyone focused all at once into making
the decock experience really to the same
high quality standards that chris has
had since the very beginning so as you
saw smoothing out animations adding hit
force reactions and damage indicators
are just some of the ways that we've
upgraded your flying experience
yes it's very cool and you'll see some
of these features in 3.0 while others
will be coming in later releases and
squadron 42 so once all these features
are in it'll help create the immersive
gameplay experience that we've all been
striving for especially me it sure will
and that's it for today's show we'd like
to thank our subscribers for supporting
all of our shows October's subscriber
flare will be released this week so
scout how to spot in your hangar to
display the next set of ship schematics
yeah and finally it's been just over 5
years since we first announced star
citizen at GDC in Austin
October 10th which was two days ago and
it's incredible to think how far we've
come in such a short amount of time and
it's only being possible because you
support us along the way so a big thank
you to all the backers out there and for
all the you've done over the years it's
really really appreciated and actually
in the light of you guys backing it
there's a couple of cool little gifts
that we got recently so if I pull them
out here one we got a very cool patch
from SF c'moon who has just returned
from his tour in Iraq and he I think
even arranged a bar citizen or I get
together at least in in Baghdad so it's
pretty amazing how far that we have yeah
we're all like we're everywhere it's
very cool so yeah thank you very much
for setting this very cool patch and
much appreciated and then also a really
sweet
letter from Louis carrion who is
obviously French and Corrigan's
pronounces a last name far better than I
can who his father is specia is the I
guess biggest French collector of
meteorites and also has a I believe a
kind of mineral yeah and he will open
this on camera but anyway he said ever
since he was four years old his dream
was to go and explore the moon and as he
got older explore the entire of space
and he's you know always thought he was
born a hundred years too early and then
he discovered star citizen for a few
years ago and it was a relevation and
and you know in in in a way his dream is
going to come true so he you know he was
a fan of Wing Commander in the days and
freelancer and he's really thankful and
so he sends this gift and with the book
that was written by his father and also
a very cool we'll see well I'm across
honest
I started I'll finish B and say
meteorite very cool thank you very much
Louie that's a really really sweet gift
and thank you very much for your support
and thank you to everybody for your
support it's pretty amazing to be here
and building the game at the scale and
scope that we're doing and it's all down
to you guys so thank you very much
looking forward to you know many more
years of expanding the star citizen
universe and you know giving you amazing
stories to experience and Alexis
squadron and beyond so thank you and
until next week we will see you around
[Music]
