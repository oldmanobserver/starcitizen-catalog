Mark Abent: Hey everyone, welcome to Bugsmashers.
I’m your host Mark Abent and I’m a Gameplay
Programmer here at CIG, LA and I take you
behind the scenes of some of the ridiculous
bugs we have.
Hope you guys enjoy, let’s start the show.
All right, we are here in the fun, fun main
menu and we got a fun bug where when the player
first spawns into a single player match, like
Free Flight or Survival mode or whatever you
want to play in single player and if you don’t
touch any of the buttons, the player will
start floating above the ship and then just
keep going and going and going forever.
I did not believe this was true cause it sounds
ridiculous until I tried it and I swear I
was laughing for a good ten minutes.
It’s so ridiculous and so awesome, I just
started a match, let’s let the loading screen
go and now we’re there and everything might
look normal but we’re actually ascending
into oblivion.
If I actually, use free cam, you’ll notice
that the player is not in his seat because
he is floating somewhere in oblivion.
I don’t know where he is, he’s up there
somewhere, if I do free cam disabled one…
he’s floating far, far, far, far away.
You can kinda see the… were moving.
It’s so weird, what’s happening.
Well, this took me down a long, long rabbit
hole.
So to start off we have a ship and we have
a seat and then we also have, where is…
we have a player.
We stick the player onto the ship by an attachment
using the good old attachment system and in
theory when the ship moves and animates, the
player will get snapped to the position.
Unfortunately or fortunately our attachment
system is a little too optimal in a good way.
Where if our ship isn’t animating or isn’t
moving, it doesn’t necessarily need to move
any of our attachments, so that means if our
ship is staying perfectly still, we’re not
shooting, we’re not flying, we’re not
doing anything.
In theory we do not need to move the player
to this position or any of it’s guns or
items because it’s position is always going
to be the same and that’s what these beautiful
bits of code do her.
So, that’s why our player’s actually not
teleporting to the seat.
The reason why he’s not moving is because
the good old physics code decided when we
transition from one zone to another zone or
the world to inside the ship, we need to maintain
his velocity relative to the zone.
That includes a bunch of things such as you
move and your rotation and all that fun jazz.
During that specific calculation it decides
to give the player a slight position due to
good old floating point resolves.
So he’s moving really, really, really tiny
and it’s just accumulates really, really
quite a bit.
So get around that fun stuff, in the attachment
the player animated character…
this handles the player’s actual skeleton
and stuff like that.
We have specific areas where when he animates
it updates relative to the attachment and
all that fun stuff.
So, what we want to do is when he’s in this
specific state, we want to just clear the
velocity.
Just in case he happens to get some, so what
we’re going to do here is we’re going
to use, what is it…
I closed all my fun stuff.
There we go, so we have this thing called
pe_status_living which we ask the physics
system cause the player is, we call him a
living entity, it’s his physics type.
We have rigid, we have static, while the player
is living because he has ragdolls and all
that fun.
We have this structure called pe_status_living
which we’ll fill out a bunch of interesting
information.
Particular information we want in physics
is this velocity which is what you… when
you press a button to move or you’re moving
to that zone as I was saying, this is the
velocity the player has so he can move through
the world.
If this is not zero, what we want to do is
now tell physics to clear all of his velocity
and rotation because when he’s in the seat
and stuck to an attachment he shouldn’t
have any velocity.
Just so happens switching from zones does
give him a little bit.
So, we’re going to disable velocity if he
ever has any.
So, let’s hit the magic recode button.
Actually we don’t have to recode, we’ll
just build because it’s pretty simple to
replicate this one since we have to go to
the main menu and then to single player.
So, we’ll let that build and then we’ll
start up the game and see what happens.
Sorry, I don’t have bacon today so just
going to be drinking coffee while it gets
done.
All right, we’re back to the main menu,
go to Arena Commander.
Wait for more loading, then single player,
go to our Free Flight and then we go to some
more loading.
I love these line rides, they’re the best.
Now if I don’t touch anything, I should
still be in the cockpit of my ship.
There we go, so I’m no longer floating away
into oblivion I’m actually still in the
ship and everyone’s having good times.
Ridiculous bugs, hope you guys enjoyed, until
next time.
So we had a fun little bug here where if you
join into a map and you stay absolutely perfect
still, the player decides to ascend into oblivion
and well that was just our backend attachment
code deciding to be a little more optimal
than it needed and our physics code deciding,
‘hey, let’s give the player a slight velocity
when we change zones’.
With those two combinations having fun and
doing their thing, it was the perfect storm
to send the player off into where ever he
wanted to go.
It was a quick fix to make sure that if he’s
in the seat and he’s done that zone transition
just to nuke out any velocity so he stays
in the ship til he’s ready to move with
the ship sometime later.
Hope you guys enjoyed, until next time.
