## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizens ongoing development I'm Sandy
Gardner and I'm Chris Roberts on today's
show we take a look at the systems we'll
be using to render Holograms and Fs in
real time yeah it's pretty cool so can't
wait to show you guys but first as many
of you know the team is very focused on
completing our 30 update for the
persistent Universe uh so 30 is a giant
link forward from what's currently
available in game and thanks to the dev
team's hard work the majority of 30's
new features are almost complete and
we've shifted into the final phase of
the production process that focuses on
feature and content integration
optimization and Bug fixing now we're
also expecting many new players or
people who have been busy playing
something else to come back in and log
in and play 30 so we wanted to make sure
the user experience is really good so
we've decided to spend more time
polishing and optimizing than we have in
recent releases uh in addition we're
also aiming to introduce our new Delta
Patcher so you will only need to
download just the files that have
changed for each subsequent patch which
means no more 30 gigabyte downloads uh
but of course this will require some
fine-tuning and a lot of testing to make
sure it works as intended now we know
that 30 is a big release and you're all
eager to play uh and we're excited for
you to play too and we can't wait to get
it done uh but we want to make sure that
it's ready so uh if you've read the list
of carots we gave when we first started
sharing our internal unpadded schedules
our very first point was quality would
always Trump schedule and the second and
third points about task estimates you
know being unpredictable due to the
nature of developing something that
hasn't been done before and the
difficulty of estimating bug fixing and
polish time are also important to
remember as we go for forward uh with
our schedules on uh finishing 30 so
that's why we've seen the constant
changes to production schedule over the
past few weeks as new issues or
advancements cross our paths we've
worked hard to communicate those to you
no matter how good or bad the news may
be uh by its very nature game
development can be an exhilarating and
frustrating and unpredictable process uh
so if our three Z schedule wasn't that
then you wouldn't be getting the true
development experience oh you wouldn't
for our new backers you may not know
with each of our major releases we've
done different things to help you track
our progress for the point8 Patcher that
launched Arena commander and the 20
patch which introduced the Pu we had our
weekly development updates that listed
current blockers and resolved bugs and
for the march to 30 we've been tracking
the major tasks we're doing with our
weekly production schedule reports so
now that we've reached this latest stage
in the process we're planning to adjust
the format of ATV to highlight exactly
what we're working on to get 30 out the
door now as all studios are working hard
to get 30 out we have decided to suspend
the studio update portion of the show so
as to not distract developers with
providing footage of their work for the
Sho updates and instead starting next
week we'll be launching a new segment
called burndown uh with this segment
you'll be able to be a fly on thewall
for some of our production meetings and
hear directly from the developers and QA
testers about the week's biggest bugs
blockers and challenges that we've been
battling it will be another great way
for you to follow 30's progress the
weekly production report on the website
will also be adjusting its focus to
match alongside the new burndown segment
ATV will bring you a weekly Deep dive
into a feature we're working on for the
game that way you'll still be getting
the same great detail about what we have
planned alongside the most current
information on exactly where we are on
the path to releasing 30 yep and then
once 30 is out we'll resume the normal
ATV Cadence with the weekly Studio
reports uh and all that lovely eye candy
that you guys like to see every week now
let's shift gears to focus on two
systems we've recently got working
together the secondary viewport and
render to text your system when combined
these systems can do a wide variety of
things from dynamically creating com
calls from other locations to rendering
Holograms in real time yeah and I'm
pretty excited about the potential of
this technology as it's going to allow
us to do some really cool things in
Squadron 42 and Star Citizen um which
we're going to you'll see maybe a little
hint of to come let's take a look
we've been working with the graphics
engineering team in the UK to develop
and make use of their new secondary
fport Tech which in itself makes use of
the new render to texture system it
allows us to do some really cool things
for our in Universe narrative in both
Squadron 42 and the Pu so far we have
used it for com skulls and holographic
volume rendering and we' have been sying
very closely with the engineers that
write all the new rendering code to make
this happen and we're slowly homing in
on a final feature set first of which is
secondary view ports which allows us to
get a second view onto the world or many
different views onto the world this is
built on top of some uh new tech we have
called the render DET texture system
prior to the render DET texure system if
you wanted to render some uh user
interfaces or screens or visors we would
have to render them directly into the
game World um and this happened after
all of the rest of the scene had been
rendered what that meant is that the UI
would always look on top of the game
world it would never truly fit in
and therefore it would never correctly
be obscured by things like glass or fog
or bloom in the same way as everything
else in the scene and this is always
bored our UI artists so the new system
the idea is we render all of this
content into textures first and then we
use that them Textures in the actual
main rendering pass of the scene and
composite them in with uh whatever
effects we need like whether we need
them to look holographic or like they're
on glass or whatever it might be and it
lets them to bed themselves in the game
World much better and have a much better
better uh lighting and sorting with the
rest of the scene we also get a few
other benefits from this we get better
anti-aliasing better sorting we get uh
better performance actually with the
fact that we can reuse the same screen
on many different displays in the game
world uh just by rendering it once and
we can even use the same screen uh on
the next frame of the games to be able
to avoid rendering cost if for example
you've got a a screen which doesn't need
to animate or doesn't animate very
quickly these new pieces of tech we've
been using in many different systems so
we've got all of our UI screens and our
visors all of our Holograms and video
comment calls and there'll be several
other uses we're hoping to fit in
further down the line like things like
mirrors things that are typically really
difficult to achieve in games the render
detex system starts uh at the engine
level when we're Gathering all the
objects really at this point all we
really need to know is that the objects
are going to be streamed so the
streaming system needs to be informed
and we also need the Max and Min screen
space size we use the maxim screen space
size along with the UV texal density to
be able to calculate how much screen
resolution is required for that texture
the minimum screen space size is
required cuz that texture may be used on
multiple different objects uh as it's
used on multiple different objects we
then need to get the largest size and
use mid mapping down to the smallest
size when you have a screen within a
screen we need to know the ordering of
the rtts so as one RT uh is rendered
before another it can then be used as a
texture within the second one we also
need to know that an R T within an RT
within the main pass if the first rtt is
half res of its parent RT and that rtt
is half res of the main pass the first
rtt must be a quarter of the res at
rendering size the rendering system has
a fixed memory budget to do this we we
allocate one large texture ahead of time
this texture is called the texture pool
uh or in this case the render texture
pool it's very similar to a standard
Shadow pool system we recently rewrote
our shadow pool packing system
uh to be a power of two quadry allocator
we use the same Power of Two quadry
allocator for the render the texture
system we render the textures as pair of
two so IE 128 256 512 1K we use the
light or the smallest size for that the
texture needs uh that we can fit in so
if if you need a a rendered texture
object at 800 by 800 we'd use a 1024x
1024 and as you move closer and further
away from the object it will require a
lower or higher resol solution and we
progressively move up and down one of
the benefits of rendered texture is we
can reuse those textures for multiple
objects so if you have a scene with many
different Billboards in them let's say
12 Billboards we would render that
texture for the billboard once and then
reuse that texture over 12 different
Billboards um the original system the UI
system for instance uh wouldn't do that
it would render the UI or that billboard
12 times because the uh rendered texture
system is now a texture and it's not uh
you know flat just rendered into the
world it means we can render any any
Curve screen anything like that the only
downside to that was we had to implement
a new system to to manage the mouse
pointer interactivity uh that we already
had we had to make some modifications um
to bring in a mouse pointer system which
which takes screen space size and remap
remaps that into uh object UV
coordinates and then we can then pass
that object UV coordinates to the UI
system the UI system is able to to work
out where on the object
that Mouse pointer is and then in
reference to where on the flash that is
and then therefore you can then start
selecting things with the character
animation it normally goes through the
camera system to decide whether it's
needs to be animated whether any of the
facial animations need to be run and as
we were running this through the
rendered texture it wasn't in view of
the main camera what would happen is it
just wouldn't render when it was in the
rendered texture system we resolved this
by having the the usual camera calling
system and the facial animation system
stuff like that communicating with the
render texture manager that Tex manager
will allow it to go through all the
different cameras and work out exactly
how big it is on screen or how big it is
with inside or Rend texture manager and
it will allow it to decide on the level
of detail of the facial animations and
level of detail in the character
animations if you do pre-rendered coms
you can't really acknowledge characters
changing costumes or ships or locations
so real-time rendering for us makes a
big difference for immersion coms calls
reflect what's going on in the worse and
for the persistent Universe it opens up
customized player avatars calling each
other all rendered life another
possibility are for example CCTV or
other room view style puzzles or life
recording of views to be featured
somewhere else in the verse there are
some remarkable consequences of these
advances in the tech our Capital ships
feature big holographic volumes on
Bridges or in briefing rooms and that
means the player can walk around them
freely for those we wanted to not just
render a second viewport using 2D
display screens but actual 3D Holograms
and you can f them from all angles
secondary viewport camera is updated
dynamically to match the relative
viewing angle from the main player's um
camera to the projection volume and then
as you move around the secondary
viewport camera moves and therefore you
can essentially move around the
holographic projection using the
existing rendering pipeline means that
we can render essentially any object
into the holographic projection
where there's no need for material
duplicates or any duplicating of
material setup it just basically works
with these existing shaders so as well
as the existing shaders we also have uh
developed dedicated shaders for various
things for example like abstract user
interface objects or if in a mission
briefing you wanted to go to a waypoint
the Waypoint could be displayed as
holographic and it'll be using the one
of the dedicated shaders that we
developed and the cool thing about this
is that we can automatically fade the
objects that are in the source volume uh
as they get closer to the boundary of
the volume we can automa fade them out
so it doesn't clip as it goes through
the boundary we also exposed two new
artistic features where we basically
allow the objects to dissolve and tint
independent of the material set up being
able to light these 2D and Hollow rtt
presences in real time at a source
location and then seeing the results in
the corresponding 2D display screen or
in the 3D Target area immediately felt
exciting to me with this new tech we can
have a character calling another ship or
location and the call appears on either
a 2d display screen or inside a 3D
Volume with the calling partner
essentially being telepresence then
what's really cool about the holocom or
telepresence is we can arbitrarily scale
The Source volume up or down and easily
create Larger than Life representations
of characters without having to resort
to cheats like scaling up or anything of
the scene and this makes it possible to
have something like a grand Admiral
appearing in as a looming figure inside
the bangal carrier Hol Globe versus him
just being a small life-size presence we
also added the ability to tint or
dissolve any object in our scenes at
will which helps staging something like
Mission briefings where way points would
need to flash green or enemy presence is
marked as red so this text progressed
really really fast and we got some
really great results but there's more we
want to do with it next thing for us is
to optimize it further we really want to
make sure that there was no performance
impact when you have these secondary
renders or these Holograms and such in
the scene we're doing a bunch of
exciting things to try and combat the
performance issues such as if you're
going to video call someone and you can
only see like a SL slight part of the
background behind them we'll use what we
call the Environ probe which is normally
used for reflections of the scene we're
going to render that directly behind the
player to avoid having to render the
entire background scene and in most
situations you won't be able to actually
tell the difference so that's one of the
examples of the optimizations we're
going to be making but there'll be many
more to make sure that we can really use
this Tech in as many situations as
possible so that you get to see the fun
gameplay that will result from it so now
that we the basics of our holotech in
place we want to stabilize it more and
spend more time finalizing the look of
these Holograms that means all the good
post effects goodies you can think of
interlacing lines I want to have
flickering when there's poor signal
quality or when the holographic display
is damaged yeah we can't wait to show
you more of this when it comes to life
later in the PE and of course in our squ
42 narrative thanks for
watching pretty awesome he uh and for
the Eagle Eye amongst you you will have
spotted the first appearance of Ben
Mendelson's character in Squadron 4 42
and Liam onion night Cunningham in the
work in progress Hollow briefing test
scene that we've been doing uh our
Graphics team have really created
something I haven't seen any other
engine and allows us to actually do
proper holographic
telepresence uh none of it pre-rendered
or Faked it's all live and the
possibilities for longer term gameplay
are pretty exciting and that's all for
today's episode as always thanks to all
of our subscribers for making it
possible for us to produce all of our
video content we've just announced that
August ship of the month is the apua
carall so that means subscribers can
test out this Jean ship all month long
just log into to the game to take it out
first spin yeah and thanks to all our
backers who have supported the game over
the years opening up the development
process to you all has been both
challenging and extremely rewarding and
I would say the emphasis would be mostly
on rewarding so I can't thank you enough
for making all possible finally if you
want to know what all of our offices did
over the past month then check out the
July monthly report which goes live to
tomorrow so until next week we'll see
you around the verse
[Music]
thank you for watching so if you want to
keep up with the latest and greatest and
staff citizen of Squadron 42's
development please follow us on our
social media channels see you soon
