hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look behind
the scenes of star citizen's ongoing
development I'm Sandi Gardner and I'm
for Stefan today's show explores the
technology design to keep your dragon
fly or NOx cruising above the ground but
first the development team has been
getting a lot of feedback about alpha
3.0 from our expanded group of PTU
testers yes they have thank you testers
let's check in with the team to see what
issues were addressed and which ones are
blockers in this week's burn down
welcome back to burn down our weekly
show dedicated to reviewing progress on
the release of star citizen alpha 3.0
we're mp2 you right now so big thank you
to everyone who's testing it's really
helping us out with our main goal of
concurrency and stability testing on a
large scale we wouldn't have seen this
many new issues without your help so
let's check out how things are going
this week we were really focusing on
trying to close out as many features as
we possibly can by the end of this week
I think besides maybe one or two
those are might slip into next week but
for the most part we're really aiming to
be feature complete with all the tiers
zeroes ads on Friday
in cargo we've had some very interesting
bugs where the system that allows us the
players to interact with the various
object crates kind of got a little
strange in particular we had one bug
where we couldn't really get rid of the
cargo crates once they were attached to
the users hands they were stuck there so
recently I fixed a bug where when you
would pick up a piece of cargo off the
ground
and then die while holding it you would
respawn and the crate would be attached
to your hand and not only would it be
attached to your hand it would be
permanently attached to your hand so if
you died subsequently we'd still be on
your hand and if you logged out of the
game log back in later it would still be
there in fact the only way to get rid of
the of the crate was to wipe the account
and reload it so there's a pretty
serious bug because that's also really
funny
we called it box hand but the fix was
whenever you would pick it and then die
we would make sure to detach the crate
from the hand and make sure that that
detachment was persistent
so that fixed the bug however is
surfaced again later and it looked like
the problem was is that if you crashed
while holding the crate you would still
have the issue because the original
attachment was still persistent so it
fixed it a second time where the holding
aining cargo at all is not a persistent
attachment and instead if you died or
crash or anything while holding a piece
of cargo in your hand it won't persist
and so unfortunately you won't have a
piece of cargo attached to your hand or
fortunately depending on how funny you
think it is for shopping for example
we're in bug fixing in Polish mode or
feature complete ready to release but we
just want to get it at that final step
ready ready for you guys so working
through some bugs for example some of
the shopkeepers facial animations aren't
playing only in grim hex we couldn't
figure out what was going on finally
identified the cause and now we're
getting that fixed up we're also playing
around with it with getting the ship
weapons and the shops trying to mess
with the layouts a little bit to see if
we can get those situated in the shops
along with the ship items it's going to
be a tight squeeze but we'll see if we
can we can get
that in there we're also working on
inventory issues some of the shops are
selling things that maybe they shouldn't
we want to kind of spread it out a
little bit so it encourages you guys to
visit all the different shops get all
the different inventories but other than
that shopkeepers are looking pretty good
too we're having a final review this
week and we should sign those guys off
you're pretty soon as well the
commodities kiosk is pretty much closed
out now we've just got a final few very
minor bugs that were just ironing out so
that that feature is pretty much
complete
so with mission givers we've put it into
a QA TR which is basically our way of
saying that test is is able to basically
go full-bore on those and make sure that
it's hitting the quality level that we
need so all the behaviors are complete
and we're looking at more missing some
minor transition animations but we
should get those in very quickly I will
do a review of that either today or
tomorrow and then it should be good to
go
lately I was mostly working with bugs
related to the mission givers that
includes the setup that includes the
bugs behaviors all that stuff
we had lots and lots of small issues
because we had a lot of untested
technology we had a lot of assets that
were never been in the game before and
we had behaviors that were only made for
demos most of our bugs related to the
edge cases where for example player
decides to stand from the chair and
leave in the middle of the conversation
or leaves the room or just stand still
and stares you for like 20 minutes what
happens then it's all about catching
those small things that players would
think about doing the things that you
would never do in the actual demo
this past weekend we had a review of all
of our ships we went in and the lead
tech designers Kirk Tomei and and John
crew went through all the different
ships and and just kind of ran them
through their paces made sure all the
different checks off the check boxes
were or present mainly just with ship
setup so we we have a big list of issues
we got a big list should say smaller
list now of issues that we need to work
out and get fixed up before we finally
release but we can see the light at the
end of the tunnel the functionality is
is pretty much there we just got to work
out the final kinks on turrets one of
the more interesting things that has
happened is a result of the code that we
put in place to allow planets to rotate
now this means that we are rotating a
zone of space inside another zone space
and this has had some interesting
effects on how projectiles trajectories
are calculated and how our unmanned and
ma'ams turrets operate those projectile
trajectories for the last week I've been
working on the targeting system with the
put behind weapons including your pistol
your vehicle weapons on ships and
turrets the problem was that the entire
engine was built on this aim controller
providing a world space position and so
what we had to deal was that whatever an
input that we took in had to be
converted into zone space saved in zone
space and then converted back out this
would also have to happen between remote
clients so that you would aim where you
intended and whoever was on the other
side would also would be aiming at the
same would see you aiming at that same
position so you had to make sure that
the number that you converted to in zone
space would would be spread amongst the
other clients and then convert it back
into a world space position in the last
weeks turrets I've received a lot of
tension from from me from the AI
standpoint of course it was not
completely about bags or fix or fixes
but rather
there were features that were much
needed so there are mainly two features
that we introduced that one is the line
of fire checks and the other one is the
accuracy control the line of fire checks
would have to ensure that weapons are
not firing nothing else but what is the
intended target so for example weapons
should not fire across surfaces of
buildings the accuracy control is there
to define an assign skill for for NPCs
so unless the accuracy for example is is
there - it's basically means how good is
an in PC to shoot when shooting toward a
target
with ifcs and a second stage afterburner
I feel that we're in very good states
with those we will do minor minor
polishing minor bugs but for the most
part those are where we feel like it
will go out with Rio - any any kind of
major complaints from PTU or anything
like that then we'll we'll investigate
those and see if the they're valid with
chris's vision and then push forward so
we found these bug recently well it was
not a bug but kind of a bad situation in
the game
where you could actually go to a landing
area and try to land but you didn't know
where to go because everything was like
everything was with a similar color you
couldn't see clearly which land in Paris
yours and with these new rules we have
now if you try to live in a place where
you shouldn't then you get like a
criminality rating and so on so it's not
ideal so we had to do some changes to
make this actually proper properly shown
to the players so the player can
actually know what's going on so in this
case the first thing we did was just
changing the landing pads because before
you didn't have any assign landing pad
you could land anywhere you wanted and
now since you have to request once you
get one Juanita assigned to you that's
the only one with the UI showing you
that's the highlighted area that's the
place you should go we have also like
increased the size of the UI make it
more visible more visible from a greater
distance so in general just easier to
see easier to identify hopefully it will
cause less problems for players
so with starmap we feel from moby glass
perspective that's done and it's
finished we've been implementing it into
the ship radar so when you're actually
in the cockpit and you can switch
between your radar and star map at the
same time we're in progress of working
not out the first rollout will probably
be to any ships that have 3d radars and
then from there a later release we will
be working towards ships that have to
dear aid ours and also 2d to 3d radar
conversions so that's that will come in
future releases but at least in the
short term for three oh we will be
looking at releasing that one of the
systems have been working on for 3-0 is
the new int system that we have in game
where the hint system works is we've
created a bunch of hints event macros
that we've been scattering around the
game code and so we can fire events from
various actions that take place within
the game things such as for example
we'll have an event that fires when you
get bad in the PU when you use your
mobile glass when you're low on oxygen
when you're low on ammo all those kind
of things and the way these events then
work is we have we have an array of int
triggers within the hint system they're
listening out for certain events
depending on our design I've wanted to
actually show the hints to the players
in game and so for example might have a
in trigger and it's waiting for the
event that's that's fired when you using
mo be glass that hint trigger can then
say okay show me this in UI string at
the bottom of the screen to explain how
to use more the mobi glass functionality
at that point we also have triggers that
work with suppression events so that for
example if you're actually doing
so an advancing game for hints might
have triggered about and we can stop
those hints from showing so that we
don't end up telling you over and over
again how to do things that you've
already figured out how to do so we try
to make it a nice dynamic hint system
that's better guide you through some of
the new features and functionalities in
3-0 and pretty pleased with how this is
gone because it's been one of the more
straightforward systems to get into game
and so for free zero we're reaching
feature complete status for what we want
to do for this patch we're there in the
future we'll probably less um extra
functionalities and polish putting some
new in Savannah as well as we expand the
feature set but and for free 0 we're
pretty happy with what we've got with
the personal inner thought we are
working on the finalized menu for that
so when you look down or interact with
this then it will link to different
inner thoughts as far as either opening
something interacting with your weapons
in Modine so on and so forth and then
we're just finishing off the menu on
that and then that should be golden UI
team has been working on the holo visor
and basically just heads-up display on
the ships we've gotten the the Holograms
working again based off of the new item
2.0 we will be putting them into the
proper places and everything like that
but as and we're also switching
everything over from 2d markers to 3d
markers so that's in star map as well as
in the AR version of the game everything
that you see is a 3d marker and then
making sure that that works with combat
and and even just looking at a ship
targeting the ship and animations
associated with that so those have all
been worked on and a fair amount of that
has been checked in but we're still
finding we're still in the final
polishes of the actual heads-up display
and the feedback for your ship as well
as the targeted ship
teams made some really really good
progress over the last week for 3.0
which resulted in us being able to go to
PT you on Wednesday last week I made
some subsequent pushes to interview
since then the last of those being on on
Saturday we had QA come in and we
managed to actually start through the
checklist we pushed up to either car PT
you on Saturday at about 6 o'clock
something like that which have fixes in
for the disconnection problems that we
were having from since Wednesday which
has like 15,000 and 6 disconnect error
which seems to have been caused by a
problem in the persistence cache which
energy civilian Tom Sawyer took a look
at and got fixed up and also had the
network latency issues that we were
seeing fixed it was well like life in
George because of the United States
Thanksgiving holidays it was entirely
driven in the UK which was the first
time I've ever done that and the UK QA
over here led by some child were able to
do the checklists for the first time and
actually we successfully pushed the
build out so it was really good
following on from that actually going to
the larger PTU audience it highlighted
quite a few issues that we hadn't seen
with the the limited numbers on evocati
and one of the big issues was a latency
issue that presented itself as first
hours rubber banding and like strong lag
and we actually had quite a few people
investigating that from an Caston indian
Clive here and it was quite difficult
one to nail down because we had limited
resources with Thanksgiving and but
thankfully armored over in the US he was
also present didn't helped out quite a
bit and we were eventually mangoes by
Thursday we were able to tie that one
down and get that one closed out thanks
to go into the larger audience in the
PTO and on Friday we came across some
nasty crashes that actually stopped us
from pushing the they were to do with
and the audio of Gatling guns and what
was causing the build to brick so we had
the audio team here and Rob Johnson and
they took around on Friday evening we
were able to get a fix in which meant on
Saturday we were able to push again
because we had enough resources in the
UK to push another build over the
weekend for evocati and the book I'm
going to talk about is a little pesky
bug that plagued us for about eight
months now and which happens only on
release bills so what happens is when
you when you walk through a level like a
cue 11 and you fire your gun sometimes
the reverb comes out completely and we
don't know why because it doesn't make
sense it doesn't happen on development
bills only on shipping bills so we had
to spend some time to get down to the
coop bit of the problem and it was quite
interesting what we found out
so when the reverb system is initialized
with everything it reads data from XML
so for development builds this XML data
is human-like readable by a human
however for shipping bills it's it's
binary so it uses a different XML reader
inside the engine to figure out what
kind of data it should set up and so on
and between those between the binary XML
reader and the normal XML Rita there's a
mismatch though they yield different
outcomes for different for the same data
so in our case it was that our XML
contained a billion attribute with a
human written string true as opposed to
false OTR Yui and what the shipping
version of the binary XML reader reads
expects is actually a 1 or a 0 so it
always failed in shipping builds and we
didn't notice for a long time it's out
there in the PTU in the wild so we
needed to fix it as soon as possible so
the fix is not gonna it's not gonna be
that so the fix is nothing that I will
do the engine team will do this probably
today but it's a really fun case of
audio making the problem really really
apparent but
nothing to do with audio itself so
generally as we push to the PTU and we
go through our clothes our clothes test
groups we'll see more and more
convoluted bugs and harder to reproduce
bugs and these are generally the really
really nasty issues that we've got to
perfect and get rid of before we go to
the widest community which is our live
release getting thousands of people
playing concurrently stresses the game
servers and services like shopping and
quantum travel in a way that's
impossible to do in earlier stages of
testing this has allowed us to get an
overall view of stability and server
performance while in PTU we can look
daily at what the team has accomplished
release updates using our Delta patcher
and get quick turnaround on issues
preventing a live release or making
steady progress and at the time of
filming this we're at 240 must fix
issues for our live release candidate of
star citizen alpha 3.0 the team has
checked in over 491 updates to the
branch and while we're closing dozens of
issues every day leadership evaluates
what's absolutely necessary to address
to go live as quickly as possible see
you next week here on burndown remember
you can always dig into more development
details by checking out our weekly
production schedule report on the
website yes you can an alpha 3.0
introduces a variety of new features and
locations some of the biggest are
Crusaders three moons to help players
explore these vast and varied landscapes
we introduced the dragonfly and the NOx
these open canopy vehicles created a
special challenge to design and
implement as they're technically not
ground vehicles or ships but are instead
a hybrid of the two that's right these
vehicles required special grav Lev tech
to hover and fly just above the ground
now let's see what the development team
had to do to get this unique flight
model working
hi I'm Matt Lightfoot one of the
associate producers at here at foundry
42 in the UK I'm David Carlson I'm a
junior game 3 programmer at CAG Andrew
Nicholson tech designer at foundry 42
all right my name is john pritchett I'm
a senior physics programmer here at CI G
I'm a flight model specialist I work
mostly with spaceships and really any
control systems for different types of
vehicle zva missiles that sort of thing
so gravel EV is a system that forms part
of our flight mechanics it specifically
affects most of our bikes on the planet
so this is the system that makes them
levitate off the ground what we wanted
to do is recreate you know the iconic
hover bike like you see in Star Wars or
the you know hover vehicles also from
Star Wars but of course we wanted to
create this you know as realistically as
we can so the concept of gravel F for us
is this idea that's it's kind of like
maglev you know you have this upward
force that depends on the distance
between you know the elevation of the
bike or the vehicle to the ground so the
lower you get the more upward forces
available for that you get away you know
the last force that it can create it's
it's a it's an extra feature on top of
the existing flat system so bikes are
pretty much considered chips in in the
flight control system and we have this
extra added layer on them that basically
queries the environment around them and
tries to orient the bikes vertically
first of all we just say okay we would
like you to be hovering this high and
then using the motion control algorithms
that I said before we can specify a
positional goal and we'll say hey we
want the back to be at this position so
what we do is instead of saying a
position we say we want the back to be
at this height and then we can let the
motion control algorithms work ash how
much force you need to hold the bike at
this hash and so once you're at that
point where okay and then we have we
have some extra layers on top of that so
we have like if you're moving really
fast we increase the elevation because
you know you're inclined to hit
something if you're traveling fast if
you're turning we work out how much
force is being used to turn the ship and
we we roll it based on that so
you know you can sort of lean into turns
like you're on a bike and then of course
we have the collision avoidance which
will query if they're you're about to
hit something and then try and elevate
the bike over it there's some limits to
that we we also had the discussion
recently of do we want to at some point
say hey you you intentionally just drove
into a wall we're not going to try and
stop you because otherwise you'll get
you know flung so high into the area
that it may take a couple of minutes to
get down to the ground again so at some
point the collision avoidance system
will say hmm this object is too much for
us to bother we'll just let you crash
into it and I think that's a reasonable
compromise it's really hard to decide at
what point do we let the bike crash
because generally you don't want it to
crash at all it's irritating for the
player if you're constantly crashing but
there's a point where you've just drove
into a wall it's your fault and so we
now allow that previously we didn't
which I think caused some of the issues
of the bikes getting flung into the air
a lot of games when they do grab live or
hover bike type systems they they tend
to use sort of a faked
you know collision or it sounds like a
hidden wheel or some kind of a surface
that's that's riding on the ground but
you don't see it and so it very very
closely follows the the terrain but I've
modeled this you know to to actually
work from it you know an upward
acceleration so the closer you get the
more it can push up so it's more of a
bounce and and you never like you know
just following the terrain perfectly
you're always just kind of skimming over
it
and so like if the ground comes up too
quickly you're gonna skid off it a
little bit you know it's it's not
perfect I always actually try to design
the control systems for for our vehicles
as realistically as possible so that you
know I have imperfect information and so
I'm not cheating so in the case of a
gravel EV vehicle now you have sensors
that are able to detect your proximity
to the ground below you and then also
looking out ahead to kind of get a sense
for what's coming
but it's not perfect so there might be
like a rock you know that the sensors
don't quite pick up on so if you're not
careful you're going to slam into that
so the player has the ability to kind of
adjust your elevation a little bit to
work along with with the control system
so if you think you're gonna collide
with a rock you can kind of go up a
little bit and you know or if maybe
you're gonna bump your head on now
outcropping or something push down a
little bit under it you may have noticed
at the citizencon stream when Glenn was
flying the knocks around he was being
really really careful because at the
time the gravel of bikes were quite
unstable and if you clipped a rock or
you clipped some bit of geometry it
would suddenly flip into the air and
spin and lose control with the sort of
vague goal of they don't feel really
good and they lose control I was tasked
with figuring out why and trying to
address some of those issues and so we
immediately like John helping out we
went in and tried to take a an overview
of the whole system and figure out you
know what could be the problem and we
have things like hey if the thrusters
are being damaged and they can't provide
enough thrust to either correct a loss
of control or they just can't provide
enough thrust to even function
you're gonna lose control or maybe you
know you're running out of fuel and the
thrusters don't have enough fuel to
counteract the spin but then we have
other issues like the gravel F system
for example basically fires these rays
out in front of you while you're moving
to detect if there's any objects in the
way and if there are it will force you
off a little bit to try and get you over
those obstacles but the problem is it
doesn't really have any limit to that so
if you for example run up to a wall
it'll just fling you right off the Neil
fly into the air which is you know it's
sort of what you want but there's limits
to it right so we went and had a look at
those things and decided okay the damage
and the fuel actually didn't appear to
be as much of an issue as it was and we
took a close look at the forces that the
gravel of system generates as you're you
know moving around and figured out that
there was actually some like bugs you
know the system is so complicated not
complicate
it's like I guess highly-strung that
very small bugs can have very subtle
effects that you that you know there's
something wrong but you don't know why
and so one of the issues we found was
the Ray casting system which is the
system that fires Ray's at and you know
the whole game uses it for all sorts of
things and we also use it for firing
Ray's down at three points on from the
gravel of bikes to figure out where the
ground is and occasionally those Ray's
hit the ground and go hey we hit the
ground and they come back and tell you
that the ground is twelve thousand
kilometers away and you're like that's
wrong
and obviously then you know screws with
all the other mats and everything goes
awry and you lose control so we found a
few issues like that
and then one of the big things for us
was the the defense system all ships in
the game have this defense system where
if you get knocked by a missile or
something or you know clip a wing on
something and your ship begins to spin
it will immediately stop all other
control and focus on using all thruster
force to try and slow down the spin and
keep you from losing control and so we
brought that system over to gravel EV it
was there before but it wasn't really
well tested and suited to gravan of so
we sort of mixed it in with the gravel
EV and we say for example hey if you're
spinning stop trying to elevate yourself
because you know what happens is you'll
start spinning and maybe the front of
your bike will be pointing toward the
ground and it'll say hey there's an
obstacle in front of you it'll try and
kick you up in the air while you're
still spinning so now we say you know
hey you're spinning just stop everything
else you're doing stop running the
gravel of stimulation and just try and
slow yourself down and then we dedicate
all power and force to being able to do
that and once you've stopped spinning we
then try and align you upwards so we'll
figure out what your orientation is and
set your goal to vertical and we try and
get you you know
oriented vertically and we also had some
issues like we had loads reports that
the gravel of bikes get stuck upside
down and they can't get out because they
can't reorient themselves because like
you know the driver's head or something
is tipping into the ground we added this
new system to basically say hey are you
clipping the ground we can ask the
physics system if you're touching
anything right now and if you are push
you up and then try and reorient the
ship again and the result is that
nobody's reported that they are getting
stuck upside down anymore which is
really good and this is you know this is
a few examples of like a huge number of
changes across the board that have just
tried to push this more and more stable
we fixed a few more issues with the
balance system that tries to keep the
bike steady so this has say you know
you've done your three raycast and
assuming one of the Ray casts doesn't
give you twelve thousand kilometers as
the result it will say okay we now have
enough information to create this plane
and using that we can orient the ship to
I say keep saying ship I mean gravel a
bike but we have enough information to
oriented vertically and we also don't
want to for example if you're moving
over some really rough terrain and
there's like a hole on one side of the
the bike we don't want the whole thing
to suddenly lurch over and and and move
we'd like you to have a little bit of
air of hey the other two points are not
haven't encountered some issue and you
haven't you know you haven't gone over a
pothole so just don't you know shift the
bike over and stuff and it's worked
really well there was some designers the
other day that we're trying to find
issues for when you damage the thruster
the the gravel of thrusters underneath
the bikes
and they kept complaining they couldn't
crash it which is you know fantastic
news a few a few weeks ago we had
complaints that crashing the bikes were
too easy and now we have complaints that
they can't crash the bikes which is good
Dave's made some really really good
progress as we've reported in our burn
down reports and he's making it feel far
far smoother and also adding in some
mechanics where you transition from
Harvey mode up to the atmospheric flight
because obviously these bikes I'm just
gonna hover along the planet you'll also
going to want to be able to kind of fly
them think Blade Runner style so he's
doing a lot of work there and all
so tightening them up so that Andy can
do a full balance pass on it as well and
that they also work with our atmospheric
flight systems like turbulence and drag
so that these bikes still controllable
and kind of you know obviously fun for
you guys to use I've been working to get
the performance of the bikes the way we
want them so much like any other ship
balance stuff when it comes to
performance it's the same kind of thing
where I'd basically run the numbers to
see how much acceleration how much
maximum g-force that should allow what's
the average acceleration what's the
maximum acceleration and then work out
using our third order motion what the
jerk value should be for each axis of
the of the of the bike it's it's much
different because we're kind of allowing
a lot higher acceleration on these bikes
maybe then you might get because the
velocity is so low I think that the
reasoning behind it so velocities low
you can have a bit more acceleration
that's the way I see it is sort of like
where as you're not going as fast and
that's using the afterburner it means
you can be a little bit snappy on the
turning it's the longest time we've had
bikes in and they perform badly whereas
people are constantly complaining about
the slide eNOS because it's when you
when you turn on a bike and you look the
direction you want to go and you feel
like you're drifting out it really
doesn't feel right it's the ship's kind
of all like that when you've got the
safeties off and that's like that's the
that's the way we want it you want to be
fighting the slide using boost and
afterburner it needs to be a hard
challenge we want to have that skill
level I think the bikes it's a little
less a little less okay to do that I
think you need to be a little bit
tighter have better performance from the
off so that people feel in control
mainly because of the hazards that are
out there a lot of these planets are so
rocky the terrain so undulates all over
the place so the gravel apps have the
challenge of staying above these rocks
and if your performance is poor and
you're sliding out it makes it so much
worse the USN depending rocks and
exploding so I need to make sure that
that these bikes are controllable enough
that you get in them after waiting so
long to try them that you don't just fly
into a rocket explode and that's really
the the X acceleration on the x axis the
making sure that's high enough that they
can turn well but it is just making sure
I've raised the numbers enough to get
the ship flying like tight to the ground
and take turns but still making it so
that if you use boosts together
basically chuck more fuel into the
engines and overdrive them you still get
that feeling that you're getting more
sharper turns when you use it the grav
level automatically calculates what it
needs to do when it comes to rocking
raises you up lowers you down
accordingly we do also have something
that David's worked on is the you can
now strafe up and down we really wanted
that I mean with it it's not only the
way that you transition between ground
hover mode and spaceflight or in
atmospheric flight and the bikes if
there is a large rock coming up we don't
want to make it so it automatically
lifts you for everything I mean there is
a bit of give-and-take
small rocks yes we wanted to bounce over
them without you having any input if
you're coming towards a large rock you
do have the ability to strafe up to get
higher and dodge that it's really
important that we had some player input
to control this stuff so it isn't just
purely whilst yes automation is good
with some of the stuff you you haven't
player input matter if the gravel layer
was important to gravel a vehicle tends
tall so far has always been also a
normal flight vehicle so it has
thrusters that can control it on all six
degrees of freedom just like any vehicle
but when you go into gravel EV mode it's
basically removing the upward thrust and
downward thrust and because this is a
more efficient way to travel across land
so all the upward force will be
generated by the gravel ev's and all the
downward force will come from gravity so
if you're cruising along and you hit you
know like a rim of a canyon you're just
gonna fly off and the only thing that's
gonna bring you down is gravity
and then as you approach the ground the
graph lives get close enough they kick
in and it'll cushion you in and you'll
just continue on from there so the
question of your ability to transition
in and out of normal flight gravel EV
mode is really separate from that I
mentioned before that you have the
ability to kind of raise and lower your
your goal elevation which is normally
automatically controlled by the gravel
of system based on the terrain that
you're going over but you can right
right rise up to a certain level and if
you hold it you know I think strafe up
is the control the reason to that if you
hold that at that peak level for just a
moment you'll break out of that and
continue flying on so that that's how
you would get out into normal flight
mode and then once you fly back down
within range of the ground and it's safe
for it to drop back into gravel eV and
it will continue on into gravel mode
automatically we pretty much have the
ability to control your elevation in
gravel if so previously you know we say
hey this is a safe height to be you know
skimming along the ground but we now
actually give you a little bit more
control so if you try and strafe up and
down and grab level you can move the
target height that you're hovering Ash
and there is sort of like this this
invisible plane that is the limit of
gravel EV so you will hold space and
you'll strafe up until you get at this
point and you'll feel the bike sort of
being stuck there for a second
keep holding space the bike will like
pop ash and you'll see on the UI that
it's changed into SCM mode and at this
point you're flying so you can lift up
and you can fly around you can go to
much higher speeds because you're
effectively a plane at this point you
can fly around you can go wherever you
want and past that point if you want to
return you need to go below this
artificial plane that you popped out of
and the system automatically pops you
back in and you can't for example
accidentally pop out of that system by
you know if you like went off the edge
of a cliff
we won't kick you out of gravel F even
though you're I know 20 meters in the
air so you'll fall back again and this
was sort of a decision to not confuse
players that they're constantly
changing the handling like if you pop
the player out of Gravlin mode their top
speed suddenly increases because they're
a plane and it could be quite confusing
if this happens without the players
intention so we ask you to explicitly
say hey I want to actually fly right now
and at that point you'll pop out and
you'll fly away and this is you know
from the atmospheric flight point of
view this is out of the new challenges
of having the bikes control reasonably
well in atmospheric flash they're really
small and they're they're easy to push
off course and so there's not really a
lot of there's not really not a huge
amount of force that's required to make
them lose control or spin in atmosphere
and so we have to sort of more carefully
decide how to apply the atmospheric
forces when you're flying like that and
it also means we can do other things
with the gravel of bikes where we can
first of all you can well you're sitting
on the back of the bike race so if you
try currently if you try and go into
space on a gravel a bike you can but
it's not the intended design what we
actually want is for you to for you to
burn up and you know be killed by the
move to space so what we would want you
to do then and this is what the intended
design is is for you to say come in with
your Cutlass or your your constellation
ursa thing and you're in flying up high
and the bike like comes ash of the back
of your Cutlass and you could fly it and
have full control all the way down to
the surface and then as you rejoin the
surface it'll pop into harbour mode and
you can skate a lot and like you're on a
bike it's quite interesting what happens
on the reverse when you're going like a
really high cruise afterburner speeds
and you come into these zones where you
want to switch to hover and how the ship
deals with the deceleration which is
basically using its own hover mode
deceleration rather than its flight mode
deceleration so there will be these
periods when you come in to land cross
the threshold change the hover mode and
you're going to have to take
while to slow down so you have to really
judge how much space you have when you
make that transition atmospheric drag
and and these things actually come into
play with with gravel of vehicles as
well it's not just base ships so the
higher up you go you know the more drag
comes into play so the idea is that when
you're in a gravel of mode and you
really hugged up tight to the ground and
your grav levels are working is sort of
in a I call it Terra planing but it's
like a drafting mode almost it's like
deep decreased drag so you can slide
very very very easily when you're close
to the ground and so like you're
especially when you start looking at
afterburner speeds you're not gonna be
able to reach those speeds when you're
at higher elevations because the drag is
keeping you back holding you back and
you're reaching terminal velocity so you
really only reach those speeds when
you're on a nice flat you know and and
you're not bouncing up into the air
definitely benefits you to read the
terrain and stay down and avoid jumps
you know and try to stay tight to the
ground for long stretches and that's
where you really get flat out cruising
you know it's gonna be very important in
racing you know because the difference
between you know going over a jump and
and you know the drag pushing against
she's gonna slow you down versus
somebody who maybe takes a different
course than you know they'll they'll get
an advantage at that in that moment so I
think that'll result in a lot of sort of
you know give-and-take in these races so
the bikes are a better option when you
need to get somewhere quickly and you
are not bothered about risk and people
engaging you obviously they're quicker
than Rovers but Rovers have turret on
top for defense and they also have total
cover around around the pilot and the
copilot or driver and co-driver as the
case is so it's just to get somewhere
quickly without without much armor
really gravel abs are really really
important to us because with 300
obviously we're implementing the
procedural planets and you guys need a
way to be able to travel around these
planets quickly that isn't just your
ships you know we've got the Rovers
which are fairly slow but you know
well-protected and gives you plenty of
tactical options but then we've also got
the bikes that are lighter armored
you're more easy you know you're easier
to be killed and the gravel of is kind
of a system that sits with those bikes
mainly
because we've got the planets those
bikes need gravel a burner system to
keep them hovering without being flung
off into the atmosphere in Logie
environments what I love about you know
terra planning is that you know every
now and then you're cruising along and
you reach a flat and and you know the
bike will just settle down really low
and you know when you recognize that you
punch the afterburners and you just
start cruising at a speed that you can't
reach any other way you know and then
once you're you're going at that high
speed you're you know right
white-knuckling it you really kind of
read in there train coming up because
any little bumps gonna send you up into
the air and it's gonna you know the drag
is gonna slow you back down
currently the gravel f system is is
feature complete any extra work is
pretty much polish we have some like for
example it can be quite difficult when
you're traveling at high speed and a
gravel a bike to shoot people because
they have guns on the front and so we
had this idea that we would allow you to
have a bit of pitch control so you can
move the ship like this and you can't
you can't do at the moment but it would
mean that you have a little bit more
range to shoot your gun so we're gonna
do that but past that point its feature
complete and we're quite happy with it
extra work is just making it feel really
good and making it you're ready for
prime time and and polished enough that
everyone can use it quite easily but
aside from that the system is we're
really happy with where it's at and
we're satisfied that it's finished he's
a lot of fun yeah it's like every Star
Wars fans dream isn't it to get on a
speeder bike fly across the planet
the phrase terror planing it really
seems to capture the feeling of what
it's like to fly these vehicles yeah as
you heard there's no invisible wheel at
work the graph left tech is actually
calculating the upward force the bike
needs to keep from hitting the ground
that really makes it a unique flight
experience in the game it sure does and
that's all for today's show but before
we go a big congratulations to the
observer test winners out of thousands
of entries seven randomly chosen winners
now have an anvil Hawk added to their
fleet you also have until December 11th

hawk and the Hammerhead which are still
on sell until December
there will also be a QA focused on land
claim licenses which will be published
