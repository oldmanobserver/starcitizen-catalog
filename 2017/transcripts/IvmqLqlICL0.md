everyone welcome to bug smashers not
slashers smashers this week we have some
technical art shenanigan that's where
now we have a little code little XML who
assets kind of squeezing them together
get that fun gameplay and sometimes
things just explode and go bonkers so we
have autry take and look at it from
Frankfurt and let's see what he has to
show us hey I'm 1/3 the way and I'm
senior technical artist and today we are
gonna fix two bucks one is on a Content
side and second one is on a performance
side first one about QA people have sent
us but let me show you what that bug is
all about that is more about as soon as
we are reloading or something at the
time of a compensator over here which we
are attaching that is slightly getting
offset it's a very minor kind of problem
c1 this frame you if you can wash it is
exactly attached with the weapon but as
soon as we are just moving with the
reload at the time it just pops slightly
up so we want to fix that by look of it
I can say that it is more on a Content
there are two possibilities either it is
content or it is more on edit meant
attachment lagging so normally we
combine your weapon with a complete
structure and I will show you where
exactly we are attaching a compensator
today our character tool is slightly
slow in today's bill it should be faster
yeah so this is a patr and all these
blue boxes are actually attachment
helpers where we are attaching any kind
of magazine or 80s views or compensator
compensator actually gets attached over
here and that is on a weapon thumb joint
so if we can actually want to visualize
that thing so this is a for the sight
attachment and on a muscle flash weapon
term joint this is the one where we are
actually attaching compensator so I look
up for it let's see if you are getting
any kind of problem on animation side so
if you are firing at the time it stays
exactly the same way on a bolt also it's
the same this one is same problem I have
noticed that was coming from the reload
so as soon as let me play the reload
animation at the time what is happening
yeah so if you can have noticed that it
slightly popped out second burns in the
fire it is right over there
and reload is slightly both this side so
that is actually causing two compensator
to move out solution could be we can
just go in and we export this animations
where it can actually stay exactly the
same position with all the animation so
let's go and export the animation
so we did that and we will just check it
on engine okay so let's see whether that
fixed anything so we have hot reloaded
compress the new animation files also so
let's see so far st. that's more the
same reload wise it is exactly at the
same position this one is exactly at the
same position Mac check is also and
exactly the same position so now we can
actually check it with the real entity
let me equip it it it all button
so 3p let's say far something so it's
still the same BAE
[Applause]
let me captain magazine so feels like
after reload still it stays exactly the
same position that it's supposed to so
that's how we fix the bar second bug is
more on a performance side and I will
show you what exactly it is giving a
certain kind of errors and that's more
on physic so we are getting certain kind
of error reports and our error is more
related to unwell it surface type for
physical ideation wise with about all
the weapons so what exactly so physics
wise we have added physics to the
weapons we can visualize that thing
withdrawing the helpers have one command
what
okay
draw helpers so these are the actually
Felix over there and it is important for
our weapons
so whenever player actually drop the
weapon it can actually electrolyze with
that thing so so it it can drop
something this way and it can collide
with a flow so that's why we are using
the physics over there but as per the
technical requirement why's this physics
could also be used for different kind of
the surfaces for example let me turn off
the helpers okay so so as soon as we are
actually shooting to a different kind of
physical surfaces it actually creates a
different kind of effect towards it so
if it's a contract concrete it's gonna
give a concrete concrete particles
towards it if it's a metal so it's gonna
behave like a metal or something before
weapons as I have shown earlier we are
just using for the ragdoll and we do not
require any special type of a surface
and now we are defining that surface
with a material so let's check what is
exactly the material for it
so now FPS weapons so let's go with a
par special and this is its material so
in proxy mats proxy material which is
exactly giving the physics stuff so what
they we can see that our surface type is
not defined and that's why it's causing
this issue so we can just define it well
whatever we want say if it's a carpet or
ceramic or anything which we can give so
according to that it can all the
interaction could happen with that but
for this one as I said it's only for the
ragdoll so we just need to define not
raw surface type let me just write over
there
so that should fix it same way we can
just go and save that item so that's how
that could be fixed and we will check it
whether that fixed or not but as you can
see there are lots of material for
almost all our weapons and none of them
have a surface type defined and that is
causing completely performance issue for
us so it is as I know as it wise it's
more like three or four hundred thirty
or something I can't keep going and
manually edit this thing so bust no
write a script and this is a script
which will go in and change all the
shader type for almost all over four
hundred and thirty files so it's keep
going and just rewriting all the
material file for us all right so let's
reopen there were weapon test map
and this time if we are successful then
we are not gonna get any kind of spam on
physics side all right so we don't have
any physic errors we are good to go and
say maybe we can check that thing on
editor also so we can't find it that's
how we fix the Box further performance
also so watch we had some fun little
bugs there performance issue because
well console spamming a bunch because we
have this surface thing where my hand is
the surface ID and I shoot it and it's
not set up for anything it's just called
black so we have to make sure that we
define what that surface is so when we
shoot it there's no spam and that cut
down a lot of you know spam the log
increases that little performance when
you first join in big win then that
other little bug was a small little
thing where the animation kind of offset
the bone so when you're reloading it
moved it up just enough to go that's not
quite right he fixed up the bone Rick's
where the animations always well hope
