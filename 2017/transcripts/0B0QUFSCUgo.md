hello and welcome to around the verse
our weekly look at the development of
Star Citizen I'm Sandy Gardner and while
Chris Roberts visits the Frankfort
Studio I've been joined today by CG
supervisor Forest Stefan thanks for
stopping by Forest uh and thanks for
having me it's uh great to be here in
today's episode we'll share how the mega
Maps feature eliminates load screens
between levels which means more time for
gameplay and less time waiting very
important stuff very important uh but
first let's kick it off with Eric Davis
and our Los Angeles Studio update take
it away Eric hey all I'm Eric Ken Davis
Senior producer here in Los Angeles
we've had quite a busy month since we
last talk so let's just dig right in to
start off our ship team has been working
on the Drake Buccaneer art has created a
custom dual weapon Mount all lods have
been generated the tech content team has
implemented UV 2s and damage Tech design
is making their flight balance paths
which will get it ready for flight with
sound VFX is making solid progress as
well the Drake Buccaneer will be a great
addition to the Drake lineup and we
really can't wait until you're in the
cockpit the ship team has also made a
lot of progress on the newly revamped
RSI Aurora the white box phase is now
complete which includes a proxy laying
out the space establishing the animation
positions laying out the screens and
making sure the characters could hold
the controls we've started the final
geometry on the cockpit in an effort to
improve the inside of the ship now that
Tech design has implemented all the art
updates into the ship's new archetype
the RSI Aurora is heading into graybox
it's been awesome to see all these
different Pieces come together and
breathe a whole new life into an already
great design we're really looking
forward to finishing up and getting it
back in the air there are a few other
ships making their way through design as
well as a slew of quality of life bugs
fixes for the upcoming 262 release but
we're not not quite ready to reveal
those just yet in addition to ship
production the tech Design Group
completed the design for multi-function
displays or MFD screens which control
power heat coolers Shields weapons
counter measures and missiles in
preparation for item 2.0 functionality
these designer prototypes are meant to
help us understand what's needed and see
how everything will interact with each
other once these designs have been
approved the amazing UI team will create
an interface to take advantage of that
functionality that engineering is
implementing in the back end once the
system is in place a ship that is
staffed by knowledgeable crew will be
able to operate their ship beyond the
default system settings and minmax the
various ship systems to suit not only
your play style but potentially save
your life during a devastating attack
this month QA aided La development
checking a variety of fixes for 262
while also providing support to Austin
QA with PTU and live sanity checks smoke
tests sweeps and deployments and helping
new hires get up to speed with the game
as for Feature work the team swept ship
destruction V effects item system 2.0
and implementation of recent Loadout
changes and tested multiple iterations
of new targeting and ESP code for a
quick reminder on quality assurance
terms a sanity check basically ensures
the game loads which is now automated
but still could take an hour and then
another 30 to 60 Minutes to investigate
any error that Ares a smoke test checks
the basic functionality but this takes 6
to eight people roughly a day if there
aren't any major issues and a full sweep
means checking everything you possibly
can a proc process that which requires a
much larger team and can take over a
week as you'd expect full sweeps are
most arduous rigorous and intense but
also incredibly important now over on
the narrative team they've been hard at
work at some additional 3.0 missions
they've also started some much needed
documentation for posters and props to
help populate the world of Star Citizen
they've also made a lot of progress on
the Shan history and Society
documentation by creating an equivalent
Time Capsule approach for the Shan
history from birth to present day also
those that saw the three lateral head
test portion of GDC a few weeks ago we
can now talk about how the team has been
doing breakdowns of ethnog groups in the
Star Citizen Universe utilizing the
power behind that technology as our
character customization is rapidly
coming together now the engineering team
has begun work on the new shop entity
that uses data core components it will
allow shops to easily stream be streamed
in and object containers which will be
finished in the next Sprint the plan is
to make shops more Dynamic and reactive
to the economy by retrieving their
inventory from the back end the
engineering team also added a new
attribute to vehicle xmls that allow
designers to specify the interior grid
type of the vehicle small medium and
large this is a pretty big optimization
that will reduce memory storage as All
Ships previously defaulted to medium
size now last time we discussed the
development of the new light group
entity that was equipped with a state
machine to serve as the ultimate life
switch now the implementation of the
Core State switching functionality is
complete the next step is to start using
the Light Group in our vehicles and
environments and replace all instances
of old layer switching method of light
management this new light group entity
has allowed us to reduce the number of
Lights we've been using which has
dramatically impacted performance for
example on the Drake caterpillar we were
able to reduce from hundreds almost
thousands of entities down to 90 or less
with no visual impact and that's just
the beginning in the upcoming weeks we
will continue to evolve the light group
with additional features based on
feedback from other departments we've
been developing also a framework in ifcs
or intelligent flight control system for
the autopilot to handle situations like
a takeoff and Landing sequence this also
applies to AI Control they'll be
providing the AI developers with a set
of tools for controlling the ship like a
a move to or change to Etc this will
improve stability and predictability of
ship motion under optimal conditions
there was also a large large update to
our room system and atmosphere
containers with the addition of several
new features as well as better debugging
tools and several bug fixes so far the
room system has only been implemented in
a few locations but these changes will
allow us to fully Implement rooms and
atmosphere throughout the various
location and ships in the game at the
moment all the air locks you enter and
exit are scripted events they don't
Factor an atmosphere of any kind with
this new system we'll be able to replace
this setup with an actual room and
atmosphere that allows for a Dynamic
experience in addition to the room
system changes they've added a feature
to allow the designers and artists to
set wear and dirt parameters for
loadouts this functionality comes in two
levels overall as well as individual
values for specific items wear and dirt
values are used by the render node to
set Shader parameters that make items
look old or Dusty scuffed up and burnt
out you've seen an example of this on
the module surface Outpost seen in the
last week's Studio update this task also
used Loadout edit edor side work where
the team added UI support to edit wear
and dirt we've recently also started
working on a pretty massive task called
The Entity owner manager to give you a
little background this is a core feature
required to take our gameplay from a
multiplayer game to a persistent online
experience this system will be
responsible for managing ownership and
lifetimes of all the entities in the
game and will work in conjunction with
the backend persistent systems to
indicate Dynamic changes to the world
that need to be tracked and persisted
across sessions The Entity owner manager
will also need to work with various game
and entity Engine Systems including
debris Salvage criminality streaming
missions cargo shop and much more to
help create the persistent experience
across clients and servers in other news
the team has been working on scanning
subcomponents which require us to do
some slight refactoring of the object
data bank now the data Bank can support
the storage of child entities which will
be the subcomponents on on ships players
Etc in doing this we also improve the
thread safety of accessing data within
the data bank which allows us to move
some calculations onto other threads
which will help improve performance this
work is focusing on two big elements the
Ping component and angle of focus the
Ping component is the method in which a
player or Pilot will send out a wave to
see if there are objects out there of
note within their scan range this could
also be a ship an asteroid or even
signal traces that Mark whether a player
entered or exit ited at Quantum travel
other players can detect these traces
which could have some pretty heavy game
implementations for example if you were
an outlaw it would allow you to track
potential prey angle of focus allows
players to adjust the angle with which
they're scanning a smaller angle will
provide more range but only contacts
within the angle can be detected we're
currently refactoring the underlying
radar query logic to use Zone queries
rather than a huge iteration of
registered radar objects which will make
the the scanning system much more
efficient now if you remember from our
last update our Tech content team
supports and implements every pipeline
within Star Citizen and Squadron 42 one
of the main focuses for this team is
performance improvements for instance we
changed our mesh vertex and position
formats which massively improve
streaming of these meshes as well as
reduces build build size they've also
been improving the python integration
within our editor which allows for
faster development of python tools
usable by every Department across the
company they can now script any sandbox
process they want for example placing
asteroids generating modular outposts
Etc all of which saves a tremendous
amount of development time on otherwise
tedious and timeconsuming
tasks you also may have noticed the
player helmets were disappearing once
they got to a certain distance away from
you as discussed in the character
customization feature at not too long
ago we've now converted all helmets to a
DOT skin format the conver conversion
was important to allow a unified LOD
ratio across the character skins meaning
no more helmetless people running around
the verst so don't be afraid as the
oxygen system comes online we would hate
to be the reason you lose that FPS
Battle On the Dark Side of the Moon to
ensure this is easier in the future Tech
content has also created tools that rig
skins and exports automatically this
dramatically reduces Dev time from
potentially an entire day down to just a
few minutes now that head helmets are
optimized heads were next on the agenda
we've successfully converted all heads
to use the human skin Shader developed
by our Graphics team since we do 44
different areas of Blended wrinkles and
Blended diffuse our texture cost was
quite high at about 100 Megs per head
with this change we were able to save
roughly 90% of the original texture
memory cross without a discernable
visual impact this means we can have a
lot more characters in the scene without
melting your graphics card with the
implementation of the female character
progressing rapidly we've transferred
thousands of animations from male to
female to complete her Motion Set and
provide a data for animation to start
iterating on this will also allow us to
focus on refinement and subtleties
without compromising on what she'll be
able to do when exploring the universe
there's quite a bit more to do but we're
making leaps forwards every
day another character animation tool the
tech content team has been completed is
this track and Report the number of
various Wild lines each character will
have in the universe with our over 1255
pages of script for squadron 42 which
includes all story lines as well as wild
lines we needed a tool to continuously
generate reports on how many we've
completed and what we have left to solve
once the various lines are all in the
system will be able to pull those lines
based on player action and situation but
and also randomize the potential wall
line response so the NPCs aren't
repeating the same line every time to
help our cinematics team focus on
content needed for squadron 42 a tool
was written to allow for visibility of
scenes before they even hit the engine
this allows for fast exporting of
animations and preview renders which are
then automatically uploaded to shotgun
which makes it much easier and faster to
review than many hours of cinematics or
Squadron
42 the character team has been blasting
through the concept phase the high poly
phase and onto the in-game mesh of the
heavy Outlaw next it's going to go into
rigging and
implementation we've also sent the light
medium and heavy female marine armor as
well as the unders suit to rigging and
implementation once we had that male
base suit done we utilized a wrap
technique with with adjustments to save
development time and ensure we're
getting everything together as quickly
as possible another suit that move has
moved through the high poly phase is the
female Explorer suit so she'll be
exploring the universe in no time on the
Squadron 42 character front both the Eva
Deb crew and the Marine BDU have gone
through high poly and are onto the
in-game mesh and texture string phase
which means they should be in rigging
and implementation in no time in a
category of things we can't talk about
we've continued developing the vanuel as
well as medium and heavy versions of the
OMC Outlaw faction and lastly the
mechanized Titan suit is in R&D along
with other alien concept sculpts and a
whole lot more that we can't reveal just
yet but stay tuned for updates in the
coming weeks well that does it here for
Los Angeles thank you so much for your
support we'll see you again soon as you
may have seen on our production
schedules our developers have been
working on a new system called Mega Maps
understandably some of you may not know
what that means uh yeah it is a tough uh
concept uh to grasp in the simplest
terms Mega map means to eliminate the
loading screens um so it basically uh
streamlines the object containers while
loading in and out the different areas
uh and the different game modes the goal
of Mega Maps is to allow players to
travel through the universe without
interruption or lag time to better
explain how Mega does this let's take a
look the mega map is a new feature that
we're putting into the game to cut a lot
of the frustrations with load times out
for people essentially eliminate load
screens all together the issues that
drove us to this technology come from
the unprecedented scale of this universe
we're creating what this means is we
couldn't load it into one m without
crippling memory and performance so we
divided it up and put the segments into
object containers which we could load as
needed the problem with that was that it
meant players would need to wait through
a series of load screens as they moved
about in the game the mega map was our
solution we load the mega map as we
would a standard map the mega map itself
is empty but once the mega map's loaded
we actually start to fill the mega map
with content our various game mod modes
via um object containers so we would
load the mega map which is empty load
the front end which is a set of object
containers load the front end game rules
which tells the game how to work in that
game mode the user would then pick a new
game mode to play at that point we throw
away all the object containers we throw
away the game mode load in the Free
Flight game mode and the ding star
object containers but we do that via
streaming rather than a complete level
load so we're able to shave um the vast
majority of the load time down to a few
seconds rather than long enough to
Warrant a load screen as you can see
even with mega Maps switched on there is
still a load stall it's only a few
seconds compared to the 30 seconds it
takes to load without the mega Maps
feature but it's still something we're
working to eliminate by making the
feature operate asynchronously so gam
playwise that's great for players if
they want to be in the front end
changing some settings they can go to a
hanger they can put some items in the
hanger look at their ships then
immediately go back to the front end
they load screens pick a game mode um as
race mode they can dive straight into um
race mode play around with one ship
decide they don't like that ship come
back to the front end switch to a new
ship still no load screens rather than
having a process where they're sing the
front end and they have to think
carefully where they want to go because
they know there's load screen coming up
go there do some stuff and then load
screen again
so by adding this new feature we're
putting into the game the first
application of um a lot of the object
container
streaming which will be um a fundamental
part of the Pu experience moving forward
as the Pu becomes essentially like its
own Mega map with a bunch of sets of
object containers that will stream in
and out as you move through that map the
the thing that makes this tricky in
terms of gameplay
programming is with the new flow we're
now not destroying and recreating the
player between game modes so with the
new setup it potentially makes it easier
to
persist some of some of the players
attributes between these game modes
because the fact that we're not
destroying him and recreating him so one
of the more interesting bugs that the
new Mega map flow has produced was QA
finding that they could um place down a
liquor cabinet in their hanger take a
few swigs from a bottle get slightly uh
blurry
visionwise then uh decid they didn't
want don't want to be in the hanger
anymore or they want to go fly their
ship in free flight however with this
new flow the players not being destroyed
and recreated so unfortunately for you
the player you now find yourself in the
ship with blurry vision trying to fly
through
space which is probably not the best
thing for a player to uh be doing so
it's something we'll obviously be
looking to fix but a nice uh
illustration of the kind of interesting
challenges that we're facing um fixing
up this new flow Mega map for
multiplayer is a little bit more
complicated it builds on top of the the
single player implementation the tech is
the same up to a point the additional
challenge is that each level in our
multiplayer game lives on its own server
to handle the tens of thousands of
players who might visit it at any one
time a multiplayer match and it comes to
an end and you want to change to another
multiplayer game mode and map then
you're going to have to um unload the
map that you're in say d star go back to
the front end make your selection as to
what you want to do and then load into
the the next map say broken Moon doing
pirate swarm or whatever because you're
going from connected to a server back to
the front end we've got to drop the
connection but we've got to keep the
mega map in memory uh empty out all its
contents put all the front end pieces in
let the player make a selection and then
go and connect to another server while
keeping a map in memory at the same time
and then streaming all the new pieces
for the new map it's a bit like trying
to unplug your computer and then
replugging it without losing power and
that's not the way we've been doing
things before it's been very much uh get
to the end of a a match you drop the
connection to the server you clean
everything out and it's kind of like a
hard reset of the system load in the
front end make your
selection end of that hard reset of the
system connect to the next server so
we're just keeping the map in memory but
switching connections uh to servers and
switching between single player and
multiplayer game modes at the same time
uh without doing this this reset which
is a bit of a challenge because the way
the engine's being built it's kind of
the assumption that once the system
starts up it'll either be in single
player mode or it'll be in multiplayer
mode and it'll always stay that way
until the system shuts down again but
now we're changing these things
dynamically all the time um so that can
create a lot of bugs so it's kind of
been a process of uh trying it out
finding out what it breaks fixing it
trying it again finding out what it
breaks fixing it and we just keep doing
that over and over taking a a system
like um Crusader and ex extending it you
might have
um an object container for each of the
stations uh each of the coms arrays
there'll be an object container that
contains references to the object
containers for where all these other
things are and they'll just be sort of
left there very lightweight form and
then as you head towards say Port Allisa
the object container for Port Alisa will
get loaded in and expanded and that may
contain other object containers that
contain parts of the Interior or
different decks or whatever and they'll
get loaded in on demand so it it kind of
you have a skeleton structure that's
defined by an object container and then
you can fill in the various parts and
collapse them down again and load out
another part and then know what scale
they going down would say a rooms an
object
container um assemble them together to
make a deck assemble them together to
make space station that's an object
container interior exterior possibly
could be different object containers
that's linked to an object container in
space it says where that space station
is and that will be parented by the sort
of root system object container it says
where all the different space stations
are on that system and different planets
and so on so it kind of scales out that
way but uh so far it's only um been done
for the star Marine maps and Arena
Commander Maps um when we bring this
technology over uh to pu it'll have to
be done through Crusader and the other
systems that are going to come online uh
so it's a lot of work that we need to do
still but the the technolog is kind of
at the point where we can start seeing
the benefits of it now star citizens
question of scale really isn't it it's
it's taking a standard game and making
it much bigger than than anything else
that's you know currently out there um
and the only way you're going to be able
to do that is by focusing on what the
player needs to know and tailoring that
experience for each player even though
they're all connected to the same server
so you're always looking for
opportunities to to not do something and
avoid that little bit work well on the
computer side of things anyway
yeah thanks guys for that Insight on
Mega Maps cutting down on weight time is
really important to improving gameplay
yeah absolutely uh I also look forward
to seeing the uh multiplayer Mega Maps
rolled out in Star Citizen yeah and then
many players will be able to quickly
Traverse the universe at the same time
