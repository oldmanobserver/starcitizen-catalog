Mark Abent: Hey everyone, welcome to Bugsmashers.
I’m your host Mark Abent and I’m here
to take you behind the scenes on some bugs
and how we smash them.
Hey everyone, we’re here in that awesome
test level of mine and I have a Gladius and
I’m going to pop right down.
So, this bug that we have came from the physics
guys, you know, they’re analyzing some things
and they found out, ‘well, we could do some
slight optimizations’ and when we have the
player and he’s just walking around.
He sends move requests to physics to move,
his physics type is known as a living body,
he has ridges and he moves organically.
So, when he gets inside one of these ships,
let’s see we’ll hop in right there.
We basically take him and snap him to the
chair and we keep him there all the time.
So he doesn’t need to do any of these crazy
move requests but unfortunately when we snapped
here, he’s still doing all of the move requests.
So, pop down into the code.
In this little bit of code that we have here,
this is how we control the player or any actors
when you want to move left or move right or
if the animation wants to force you to move
to a specific location.
This little bit of code runs and it figures
out what it needs to do and it sends either
requests to physics or requests to animations
to do some alignment.
So, once we get down to this little bit, if
we’re bound to an attachment which is going
to be basically here inside the ship or in
a seat or some other thing that needs to keep
the player in a localized area.
We basically, if we have an attachment we
move all of his move requests local to that
attachment, that way if we sit down here he
still moves but it’s relative to the attachment
because we’re always forcing him to that
location.
In this bit of code is where we tell physics
to stop moving because we’re basically just
moving the player entity by game code around
that location point.
So every frame we’re basically saying, ‘hey
physics, stop’ and what this actually does
is the physics code will actually do some
internal stuff that basically wakes him up
and maybe does some things that were not necessary
because… well, we’re doing our own thing.
So, the guys in the UK specifically Jens decided
what we could do instead if we get the movement…
we’re going to check the status of our position
and we’re going to see if our position is
active.
We actually want to see the player dynamics.
So this is something specific to the player
physics, we want to see what the player is
actually doing because living entity like
I said he’s more organic so he has a lot
more features.
So we’re going to check to see that the
player is actively walking, so physics is
moving him then we’re going to stop it.
From this point on we don’t have to tell
physics to do anything because he should still
be stopped.
So, we’ll hit magical recode button.
No...recode.
Ah, here’s the one fun thing physics, this
bull not a bull so we gotta make sure it’s
not zero.
Physics does some crazy, crazy optimizations
and tricks especially since it’s an old
system so what you think is a bull is actually
an ent, joy.
Recode.
Why are you… ah, recode, recode, go!
It would help if I used the correct function,
physics has a params and status and why don’t
you want to get… ah.
Two early in the morning.
So physics has params and status and you have
figure out which…
basically you just look at the function to
see if it’s params or status and call it
the appropriate function.
Then of course you have to remember that this
takes in pointer so you have to send in the
reference of the structure so physics can
fill it in.
Those early mornings when you think have it
down, the error code pops up and you’re
like, ‘oh, of course’.
All right, so we ran it and now that’s were
inside the ship we should not be getting any
break point in here and of course as we move
around the ship, we get nothing.
So if I pop out, where’d my ship go… hop
back down, wooo.
My guy won’t run in this area of the code
but he will do some movement requests down
here which will send it to physics.
All we care about though is the attachment,
so we’ll go back in and I’m still free.
The attachment code kicks in, so this is the
first time it runs since I was moving around
I might be active.
I’m not active so it clears it and we’ll
see.
Yup, so we never hit it again, perfect.
There you go, hope you guys enjoyed.
So, as you guys saw we had a fun little optimization
there.
The physics guys are like, ‘hey, we’re
getting these crazy move requests from the
player when they’re in the seat, they shouldn’t
even be moving’.
So if we optimize it a little bit there, the
physics side won’t have to do all these
crazy calculations when the game side is just
going to keep snapping them.
So again, just put in a little fix…
1,2,3, bam.
Slight easy optimization and we gain quite
a big performance in Crusader especially when
we have all those AIs running around and we’re
snapping them into place, you don’t need
to do physics moves.
So nice little optimization, speeds up the
game and gives you guys that little bit extra
FPS.
Hope you guys enjoyed, till next time.
