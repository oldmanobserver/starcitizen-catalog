## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look behind
the scenes at star citizen's development
I'm sandy Gardner and I'm Steve bender
in today's episode our designers will
discuss how we're implementing
atmospheric flight and differentiating
it from space travel but first let's
check in on the development team and
take a look under the hood in this
week's burn down welcome back to burn
down our weekly show dedicated to
reviewing progress on the release of
star citizen alpha 3.0 we're getting
close to live release so let's check out
how things are going so we're on target
now with the issues we've got we're
getting quite a few and the issues fixed
up and the ones that are propping up a
more feature related issues which are a
lot simpler to fix most of the time than
code issues and so it's good to see that
we're moving into this this transition
of feature issues rather than code for
the rest of team we're now into book
fits and polishing mode for 3.0 so the
remaining issues after I've gone through
I've moved the tasks will leave us with
any outstanding bugs 43.0 obviously the
world will come in as some of these
features are tested a bit more heavily
and keyway are focusing more on on
hammering those
the mission givers they went through a
full QA TR I did my my review last week
however that was not in the game it's it
was a multiplayer so now we have a
review set this week for the full in
game and basically being will switch
between all the different reputation and
virtue variables so that we can see all
of their lines and then once that's good
that will be sign-off but we're more
basically in the final 95% of it on the
mission giver side of things we are
turning attention to the feedback that
todd papy has given this week he's given
some feedback in relation to the
animations having issues where the
character is looking off a certain
direction and then we'll sat back and
and look at you when he's delivering his
lines we're also making sure we're
putting the final finishing touches on
on ruto to make sure the the the overall
effect of the route of route owes coming
out of the hologram looks really really
good so we're getting those final
details locked in and should have those
characters ready to go soon one of the
strange issues that popped up last week
was all a I and NPC ships were spawning
in without pilots they responding
completely empty and which meant the non
of the missions that involve those could
be completed or you couldn't leave and
all swans the shits just didn't do
anything so Rob Johnson and spent some
time and he was able to fix that one up
again before we went to beat you so we
received this bug regarding whole
objects from de we're basically shadows
from whole objects were being cast on to
the main scene hollow objects are
basically invisible to the main player
camera and we resolve this bug by bassy
during the shadows zone query we have a
bunch of flags that we can say ignore
these types of objects or take these
types objects and we basically resolve
it by saying follow a shadow zone query
ignore all objects from coming through
and therefore it won't render in the
shadow pass and you won't get a shadow
appearing in the main scene today I'm
gonna show you the bug that we calling
the ghost of grim hats
this is the room we'll meet who tow one
of our mission givers is no it looks
nice and empty everything is fine look
what happens when I turn on the
flashlight there's a ghost it's not a
shadow as a volume what it actually is
it's actually Ruto himself to create
this hologram we are putting invisible
and NPC into the world
then we animating it and projecting to
the to the hologram and apparently this
this invisible NPC can be illuminated
with a flashlight at the moment bug is
on the graphics programmers we're hoping
to fix it soon so you could have grim
facts without any ghost so the NPC admin
officer I reviewed last week and that's
from a behavior standpoint was good now
we were doing the final step of that
which is integrating that into actual
missions and so once those are done I
will review it from start to finish in
an actual mission and then it will be
signed off we have just started
balancing of environmental missions so
these are the probability volumes that
you may have heard of but Tony
certificate has been working on so these
are in our dev builds so you'll be like
you know quantum traveling along and be
pulled out you know there's an asteroid
kind of rogue asteroid flowed in via the
path of a thing and they make maybe it's
caught a few other people involved you
know into in in there as well and it
could be pirates it could be something
smashed into it so there's a little to
explore or interact with and while your
quantum traveling as I say these are not
obviously released yet but work because
we're trying to balance fees so it
doesn't feel like an a final fantasy
constantly being pulled out by a bad guy
kind of thing as you're trying to get
from A to B which it currently does so
yeah we're ballot we tune in though
until we get something that's kind of
rare and but like so it kind of shocks
you when it happens our admin office
worker our designers are still
continuing to work on that and we've
pretty much closed that out now we're
just now implementing those into the
mission flow so that you're able to
interact with them in that you get
mission markers specifically denoting
them and one of the issues we've noticed
for a while as well as been raised by
some of our best pilots in the community
is a an ESP book where ESP was not being
able to pull you onto target after
several of our team looking into this
this actually seems to be part of a
bigger issue with ifcs
and ifcs oscillating so slightly moving
around and overcompensating and under
compensating in particular circumstances
both John and David have been looking
into this this week so they can get to
the bottom of it
we fixed one of the bugs with this which
should improve it slightly but the team
will continues to work on this so we can
make sure that ESP and I FCS is is as
good as it can be for r3 or release
while the ship set upside we are just in
bug-fixing and polish mode now we are
fixing bugs left and right bugs to do
with 300 series animation issues where
the player is getting up into the 300
eye and being shoved out through the
bottom of the ship somehow we're fixing
up landing gear issues on the glaive as
a glaive is not really landing properly
and tipping over we're fixing up issues
with the herald atmosphere there's
certain parts of the herald where if you
stand at the specially right spot you
can suffocate and die so that's a
problem we're fixing that up also
we're also turning attention to some
balance things as well
we have shield balance in QA testing
right now we've got four four-sided
shields or you can actually divert power
to various parts of the shield's and
stuff like that so we're testing to make
sure that looks good and feels good for
each ship we're also doing that across
the number of a number of different
ships as well and items to make sure
that the balancing effort is going
smoothly we will be doing some final
work on the EMP to get that ready and
for the most part it turns off
everything in the ship already turns off
the MFE turns off the power however
there were some still 2d layers of the
HUDs that were not being turned off
we'll get those turned off and so I view
that those is kind of minor bugs but
that should be good to go as well this
week I've been working on a lot of ship
issues they've been multiple numerous we
have a lot of issues with the doors
coming in you notice the caterpillar
doors slamming shut and a wall of
collision preventing you from getting
out we've also had problems with the
constellation cargo bay calling and
lighting issues a lot of this is because
if we've now separated the doors as
items now to better communicate and do
damage in the future the systemic damage
work so this is going through different
processes some art related some
technicals sometimes I'm passing it to
an engineer
sometimes I'm fixing it myself and
there's also rigging issues so there's
numerous issues going on caused by the
itemization but we're working through
those problems so we've made updates to
the shields the real update that was
made was that we have actually balanced
all the shield Health's which we'd have
an opportunity to do that in the past
and so I'm sure a lot of players are
frustrated with how difficult it was to
take down ships so what we've done is
we've taken all of the size the vehicle
and the size one two and three shield
generators and then bounced the health
so that they're a reasonable value for
the four phases on each of the ships
that we have so far the recharging time
you'll notice is much more reasonable -
and that they'll take some time to
charge all four and this results in the
each individual face taking some time to
take down and without allowing them to
charge to wrap at a pace so that it's
impossible to take down a face a shield
you're hitting with your guns
the shield screen consists of indicators
for your power your regenerate the
actual amount of health in each shield
face the distribution of the shield
health across the shield system as well
as the the status of the hardening
system whether it's active how much
cooldown time there is and also it lets
you know when you have when your regen
is is broken when when you're when you
hit zero health it has to recover from
that so you also have a standby button
to let you trigger that so this week
I've been working on overall damage and
debris there's been some changes on the
engineering side for how our ships break
apart so I've just been going through
all the ships with a fine-tooth comb and
making sure that all the pieces break
apart in the correct order and you know
the overall ship dies and everything
flies away correctly there's been some
ghost debris that kind of hangs around
afterwards and we have various issues
were working through
to make sure all the ships look as cool
as possible and actually work correctly
with insurance integration there's just
minor bugs right now where it's just not
showing the players balance or or how
long it has to remain as soon as we get
those bugs fixed then everything will be
we'll be good to go
and this week in our burn down we've
fixed some issues with grab Lev so one
of the issues that we've been seeing on
the PTU build is the bikes dragging
across the ground
we've severely reduced the amount of
times this happens although there's
still a few user cases where this is
still occurring and these it will we'll
continue to investigate these so with
item 2.0 balance as well as the
atmospheric flight tuning we've finished
what we consider kind of first pass on
those with the the balancing and
everything that will continue until we
actually ship three Oh as far as the
atmospheric flight we feel that's in a
pretty good place we've we've just
recently checked in some some new fixes
before that and some new balancing for
that as well but with the item 2.0 we've
we've gone through and we've done some
more fuel adjustments and and we're
getting that to you the place where we
see so it really depends on how the
players hammer on the boost button and
if they're if they're flying
conservatively then they the fuel will
actually last longer and and it's
getting to the place where from a design
standpoint we feel it's right then going
through and adjusting the power the
shields that those will be kind of a
constant ongoing thing until we actually
ship 3.0 we've gotten some more
atmospheric flight issue fixes in which
include fixing turbulence when the ships
are stationary so one of the things you
may have seen in some of the previous
PTU builds is even when the ships are
stationary they'll still wobble as if
they're being impacted by turbulence
which most of you will know that that
isn't even vaguely realistic so we fixed
that
ship item UI integration we're on the
second of three QA TRS so ideally bone
gets the third one in today and then
once those are all in we should be good
to go
and at that point we'll we'll set up a
review to to look at it make sure that
you know everything is ready for the
players then from there with the PMA
that is finally entered in QA TR we have
the the category the categories the way
that we want them to be
we were finalized in the highlighting so
ideally once that finishes the QA t are
then won't be ready to to flip the
switch and say that da does feature
complete the VMA is is being worked on
right now as we speak since most of the
work that is being done on the PMA
transfers directly over to the VMA so
then from there we'll will probably need
to do some minor cleanups and and the
way that we sort through the the list of
the items that are on the ship and but
that's pretty minor personal inner
thought went through an impromptu desk
review with Chris yesterday and that is
is basically in designers hands now to
implement it the way that Chris wants it
and so I think from feature standpoint
that there's just minor fixes on that
one
we've had loads of work going into the
persistence warning right now in the PTU
people can use the beds as a safe point
to log out and then come back to they
can use a personal inner thought to do
this when they get into the bed and
we've been having some great feedback
about that already as for performance we
made some good progress especially now
with the feature log in place so the the
features are locked and now we as a
performance team can go in and really
see okay this is the set of features we
want to ship with and we can go in and
see okay where can we improve even more
because prior to that of course new
features were coming in and we had to go
over and over again because new features
might of course cause some more
performance trouble for us so but now
with the future lock we can really go in
and see okay where can we improve on the
other side what what helps us as well is
people now stop working on new features
and do have the time to go in and
actually fix what we point out to them
so instead of working on features we can
now work on performance and actually
polish what we've already got last week
we had David Coulson working on the
ranged based I realized variable update
culling and which is a an amount of work
that should improve performance quite
significantly across the board
especially with larger player cuts and
going up to 14 50 player cuts and he
checked in that work on Friday but it
has created a few issues which keyway
highlighted in a test request that they
were doing for this work and so since
then we've had David and Clive of the
network team and Chris Balti over Andy
all working together on and trying to
resolve these issues and some of them
include things like desync and
performance spikes and issues where
you're spawning incorrectly and so
things like that they've been working
together to try and get them all fixed
so we can get that out to the public and
test it on the large scale that we
needed for last week we've been fixing
issues and probably most notably there
was a bug where if a server being
running
about six hours physics time and start
going backwards one of our network guys
spotted the issue put a fix in and now
time always goes forwards which is which
is good to know personally in a thought
has passed its final review now so
that's also in the PTU for people to use
we've been getting some great feedback
about that as well there are still
things we want to change and to polish
as the the final pass before we're okay
with it being the final implementation
for 3a but this is very very close now
stress testing the game with thousands
of people playing continues to throw off
tremendous amounts of information
regarding both performance and stability
daily updates using our Delta patcher
are allowing us to charge ever closer to
this live release as of filming this
we're at 176 must fix issues for our
live release candidate of star citizen
alpha 3.0 the team has checked in over
518 updates to the branch and closed
dozens of issues every day as leadership
continues to hone in on what's
absolutely necessary to address to go
live as quickly as possible see you next
week
he run burned down don't forget to check
out our weekly production schedule
report on the website for even more
insight into the development process now
as many of you have noted in the forum's
piloting a ship in space should of
course feel very different than flying
in a planet's atmosphere that's right
aside from gravity did contend with wind
and weather will eventually be factors
while flying planetside our team has
been fine-tuning the functionality that
will help make atmospheric flight feel
convincing and distinct let's see what
they have to say about the unique design
challenges associated with introducing
these new mechanics
so I'm Mike Snowden the VFX director I'm
David Coulson I'm a junior gameplay
programmer here that sort of ended up
specializing in flight control and ifcs
sort sort of tasks
I'm Andrew Nicholson and I'm tech
designer at foundry 42 my name is John
Pritchett I'm a senior physics
programmer here I specialize in the
vehicle control systems flight model
missiles you know any place where we
need control systems when you talk about
the atmospheric flight we're talking
about the long-term goal and
implementing a short-term goal as well
long term goal we want to have thrusters
performing differently in space and an
atmosphere in space you've got way more
thrust to use and it's gonna be like an
impulse effect so you have these really
high accelerations that are very short
lengths of time so the pilot can manage
them they're not really high g-force but
for a very short at the time and the
opposite to that is sustained thrust and
that would be what we use in atmosphere
so you have to always be firing these
thrusters to stay above the planet to
say gravity you're fighting gravity with
these thrusters so you get much less
performance and so that being the
long-term ambition of how thrusters work
in the short term we're trying to
implement how would that feel so when
you enter atmosphere come to any of the
planetoids in 3-0 the the ship is using
what would be sustain thrust which means
lower acceleration and to do that we're
kind of switching to a different state
like an atmospheric flight state which
means you cross the threshold you enter
atmosphere and now you've got less
acceleration to play with there's more
to do there when we want to do the
asymmetrical effects of drag on stop
times and performance but right now
that's not there so my role is taking
the numbers that we have for Space
Flight looking at the performance of the
ship and then translating that down into
atmospheric which as a general rule is
like I see as being two-and-a-half times
less performance
so you've got less acceleration so I
basically take spaceflight run the
numbers in a big spreadsheet and then
translate that into what we need for
third arc third order motion so we've
got the velocity the next in the stock
time then we need a jerk value for that
and so I have to put all these numbers
into a spreadsheet get the jerk value
out and then put these into a ship EXO
now get them into the lumberyard and and
then and then run like an output which
gives me all the tuned parameters and
then I use those to put back into the
ship XML it's kind of a laborious
process the fun side of it is the back
and forth play test you know you get
these numbers and then you go oh this
this ship is way too sluggish it's too
slow I'll tweak them here I'll raise the
the accelerations here and do the retune
of the ship in some cases with the
larger ships you have the problem R of
right now you switch them to this
atmospheric tuning they've gone below in
some cases below 1g acceleration so
we'll start to fall in atmosphere so
then it then it's a case of alright I'll
shunt I'll take power away from some of
the maneuvering thrusters and power them
into them just the thrusters on the
bottom of the ship for said and once
you've done that I mean then they can
then they can enter atmosphere and not
just crash into the ground I had that
problem with like the Star Ferry the
caterpillar just plummet and you just
siphon it off from the other thrusters
basically to get that performance and
future ships like the Starfarer they'll
use VTOL thrusters we don't have them
set up to do that just yet so today's
kind of like let's just take it off the
maneuvering thrusters and make sure it
flies okay I get to basically design the
the physics you know the flight model
itself and implement that into the game
develop a system that allows the
designers to to tune the ships to get
the behaviors that they want out of them
in our game all of our our vehicles will
be spaceships but we want to have the
ability to bring those spaceships
planetside and
atmosphere and when we do that we wanted
to include additional forces in the the
flight model to include drag lift some
turbulence from wind and and different
factors like that so previously the
atmospheric model was like counteracting
for gravity and drag so it would just
use the thrusters to basically balance
out gravity and balance out drag which
is you know if you were making a
spacecraft or a fighter plane in real
life that's what you'd want to do
because it makes them it makes it fly
really precisely but what it means is
that it sort of feels like you're flying
in space because you just can't feel the
gravity because the flight system is
just trying to counter active and we got
a lot of this sort of feedback from the
gamescom presentation particularly so
the new model tries to use gravity and
drag to help it so for example if you
are trying to slow down downwards you
can use gravity to help you and you can
use less thruster force and it will come
easier so you've got gravity to help you
when you're going when you're trying to
slow down going off words you'll slow
down
slower and so what happens in the end is
that you sort of have this like
asymmetric imbalance in the ship that
you can feel and so say for example if
you're like if you're trying to slow
down with your pointy Gladius ship going
in towards the wind
you're gonna slow down a lot slower then
if you angle your thing up like this and
try and fly like this and so you can
really feel like it feels like you're in
the atmosphere and it feels like this
air that's pushing on your ship so we've
been working on that pretty much since
Gamescom but our immediate goal for the
PTU release is a little bit more of a
turbulent simulation so what we have now
is turbulence and wind that sort of
affects the stability of the ship I
guess so if you get if you start flying
really fast the ship sort of shakes and
buffle about and you can sort of feel
like you're right at the edge of you
know the aerodynamic limits of the ship
which feels really good and it it again
separates it from feeling more like
you're in space when you you know you
can't really feel anything because
you're just in nothing that's pretty
much so this is what we have now and
it's pretty much in the game now and
running and it feels really good you can
feel a lot of difference between like
aerodynamic ships like say the Gladius
can go quite fast and it's sort of just
a little bit shaking around and then you
know something that's shaped like a
brick like the aurora it's like shaking
or on you can't really control it super
well and it's really hard to fly which
is good some of the the tuning that
Andy's been doing is like been trying to
find this line of what's to
uncontrollable and what feels good but
is uncontrollable like under control
levels too too strong of a word
it's more just that we want you to feel
like you're at the limits of this ship
and if you push too hard you're gonna
lose control but we don't want it to be
that you can't control it in the
atmosphere which is just not fun we
actually have had some of those issues
with really small ships like the Merlin
and the gravel of bikes because they can
now fly in the atmosphere as well and
they're really small and light and you
really get pushed around a lot and in
like you know in high winds and and
you're moving really fast
it feels really strongly that you're not
quite in control anymore
it feels really good and it makes it
really separates the the flight from
being in space to being in the
atmosphere which is what the goal was
the way I approach that actually is more
through the control systems which is
what interfaces the the player or in
real life the pilot or whatever with
with the vehicle that sets limits on
what they can do with the vehicle and
how the vehicle performs or whatever so
you can still have realistic physics
while at the same time creating more of
a traditional gameplay experience
through the way the controls are
interpreted and
and vehicle response to the player we
basically have this this ability to
specify goals in position or velocity or
acceleration and the ship will try and
achieve those goals so that look the
most complicated one is position which
isn't used for a general flight it's
more used for AI and stuff where you say
I want to get to this goal and the
system will try and figure out how much
to Perich thruster and everything to
actually achieve that goal we use the
velocity goal and the acceleration goal
for when you're actually flying around
you know you are controlling the ship
and those controllers now basically
include drag and gravity in their
predictions so if you say hey I want to
get to 200 meters per second in this
particular direction the algorithm will
look through all of the current forces
that it has available it and go okay
hey gravity is is helping us in this
particular direction that we're trying
to accelerate so we don't actually need
to give as much thruster force or maybe
if you're going the other other
direction you need to give extra gravity
to counteract the other side of gravity
which maybe your thrusters just don't
have enough thrust actually to give
enough force to counteract gravity plus
what you actually want to move in that
direction and so that's now included in
that core model which is the one part of
it and the turbulent stuff is a second
layer that we have on top of the flight
control system so you know we have the
the control logic which is you or an AI
give input into the system and the
system will try and figure out how to
get to that configuration and then after
that we have all the extra stuff which
is things like turbulence just random
air and and stuff like that that gets
added on top which is you can think of
it as like the external forces that are
moving or attempting to move the ship
that you are not in control of and so
obviously turbulence and wind is the big
part of that one so when you're flying
around you'll have your control input
and you'll say hey okay I want to get to
this configuration
and then on top of that the turbulent
system is going to calculate some
turbulence based on the atmospheric
density and the wind and everything and
it's gonna say hey I'm gonna add this
extra force we're just gonna move your
ship and then the ship will obviously
have to react to that you'll have to
react to that and the reaction systems
will try and kick in to keep you on the
goal that you want with it you know
so as the ship just won't have enough
thrust to do it and you'll get off
course or you know the chivalry bustling
around or something like that we
dynamically calculate the cross
sectional areas for for each ship so the
amount of surface area that comes into
play in drag will be unique for every
ship and not just for every ship but
based on the state of the ship so if it
gets a wing blown off that's going to
affect not only the amount of surface
area that it has for drag but also the
center of drag where that is relative to
the center of mass on the ship and
that'll you know result in torque based
on I'm dragging and things like that so
it's it's a very accurate drag
simulation so the thing about
atmospheric flight specifically with the
effects is there's always going to be a
transition when you're on a planet or a
moon that's actually got atmosphere
that's when we're going to get the
contrails instead of engine trails so
the key to it is it's it's a visual
thing so it gives people a sense
visually the there's different things
happening here and obviously that's just
backing up the actual what the ship's
doing and how people have got to react
to that so yeah contrails you're gonna
see all the players contrails so if
you're chasing or you're in a park or if
you're in a dogfight you're gonna see
these contrails based on the fact that
you're inside this atmosphere we take a
little bit of unrealism just out of
practicality like for example in real
life the atmosphere doesn't really end
it just sort of extends ash arbitrarily
into space getting thinner and thinner
and thinner but we actually have a line
where we're like past this point there
is no atmosphere of past this point
there is but the but the atmosphere
below this line is really weak and so
when you get into that sort of part of
the atmosphere you'll look first of all
you'll start seeing the atmospheric
reentry effects particularly if you're
coming in from like orbital speeds as
you get lower and lower you start to
feel it more and more and more
and when you start to get really low it
actually we're still sort of tuning this
but what we would like is for right on
the surface
you actually feel it less you don't have
the turbulence of wind blowing over
hills and mountains that you have a
little bit higher up in the atmosphere
so when you get lower it's actually a
little bit a little bit safer and a
little bit more stable than if you were
to try and fly a little bit higher
we actually had some issues when QA were
testing the system where they reported
that you could fly like extremely high
speeds in Yalies atmosphere and
immediately we were concerned that this
is an issue and then we went and
actually looked at and realized that
actually the atmosphere on Yela is like
1% of de Mars atmosphere and as a result
that there's pretty much no air
resistance there's nothing to slow you
down which is completely realistic so we
were like well in this situation this is
not a bug this is an actual feature and
so we have that already we're still
working on things like weather and
storms and stuff I think we saw that at
last year's citizencon with the
sandstorm stuff like that will affect
the handling and stuff but we're not
quite there yet but we already want
particularly the atmospheric density
effects the handling and then weather
changes will also affect it but that's a
future goal that we haven't quite got to
you so the flight model that we have
today I took the approach of where it's
basically the same control system that
you have in space but then we have the
addition of drag and turbulence and
gravity forces so ifcs will actually
work to remove those forces you know
allocating thrust to to countering
gravity and countering drag and then
having removed those forces then it uses
the same motion profiles that it would
use in space to control the ship so the
result is you you feel like you have you
know less thrust available because it's
being used for other things and and
you've definitely feel the turbulence
but overall it's still the same flight
model that we have
space whereas the the new model I've
actually already worked you know worked
out the calculations for it I just need
to get into the engine will actually
include these additional forces lift
drag and gravity in in its calculations
to carry out whatever actions that the
you know players is trying to achieve so
for example if you're sitting here and
you want to go down rather than
countering gravity and then pushing you
down it'll just generate less upward
thrust so that it just drops gently down
you know using gravity to your advantage
so that's the main difference the player
in the game will be able to start taking
better advantage of those additional
forces of lift drag and gravity it's
been developed pretty much to separate
the the feeling of flight from space and
atmosphere and it's it's partially you
know a gameplay decision that it's nice
to sort of have your your general moment
to moment moment gameplay be refreshed
so you know when you're playing the game
and you're in space you you sort of are
inclined to get used to flying in a
certain way and then when you get into
the atmosphere we would like you to sort
of feel different and we would like you
to change your gameplay style and to to
feel that you know this is different
then you need to adjust your gameplay
which is sort of like you know you can
take the analogy of you know when you're
watching a movie or when you're writing
a movie you pace it so that you have
moments of like this high intensity and
then we're going to give the audience a
break for a minute and do something it's
sort of like that but with gameplay so
you're gonna be flying around and then
we want to change it up a bit and just
you know give you some different
experience for a few minutes which keeps
the keeps the gameplay a bit more
interesting but on top of that it's
really important that this meets the
expectations that a player would have
about flying in atmosphere and this is
where the feedback from games come came
from people would see the ships flying
in atmosphere and they would be like
this doesn't really look right you know
like the ship is just like it's like a
fly just darting around and moving
around like this in atmosphere I mean
it's realistic if someone were to make a
spacecraft in real life that had the
power that our ships do who would behave
like that but it doesn't look good
and it doesn't feel good and so a lot of
that is to also make it feel better and
make it
look better so that you know players get
into the atmosphere maybe you're like
sitting on the planet and you see your
friend fly in with some ship and you see
like bustling around in the wind and
everything rock you know it looks really
cool
that's also what we're going for I think
most of the challenges have been
figuring out where the line is - it's
sort of like less of a technical
challenge and more of a design issue of
where is this line between being
realistic and being suitable for
gameplay that's really difficult to do
it's really easy to make this perfectly
you know hyper realistic simulation but
that's just not fun unfortunately and so
we have to like you know we do things
really realistically and then we go hmm
this might not be the best way to do
this we have to actually go back and and
try and you know adjust the system to be
more fun and to consider how we can
accommodate the players you know needs
and wants out of the system we've had
issues as well particularly where say QA
or avacado you're testing the game and
they have some feedback that isn't
really specific like they'll just say oh
say gravel of bikes for example they
don't handle well and I'm like what does
that mean like what it why can you can
you not turn quick enough are they
losing control too much like there's so
many things that could potentially
contribute to it doesn't feel good and
in the case of gravel EV you know it's
it's usually lots of things so we have
to sort of try and figure out what in
this system could actually be giving you
the behavior that you have and how can
we fix that that doesn't sound like too
much of a technical issue but from a
design side it's really really hard to
do that and it's a thing that we're
constantly sort of learning about as
people play the game and test it we're
figuring out you know this isn't working
or this isn't really fun we need to try
and reconsider this
and then we have to again convert this
like fake it's not fun feedback into
actual like hard technical feedback of
oh this bit of force is being applied
too much or where you know we're
rotating the ship the fraction too much
here whatever it is and that transition
is hard it's really hard one of the main
challenges we had was the afterburner
deceleration yet 1200 meters a second
when you hit the upper atmosphere and
you need to be able to slow it down
before you crash into that planet when
we first put this upper afterburner
speed in everyone in key way including
design which is flying into the planets
crashing exploding being furious with
the whole thing so we have to come up
with another approach the initial idea
was you'd have less acceleration but
you'd be able to hit higher velocity so
when you went in to cruise up through
normal SCM afterburner velocities into
cruise afterburner you'd have less
acceleration so it was slowly pushing up
to the high velocities but we found with
that as soon as you hit the crossover
threshold from an SCM afterburner to the
cruise afterburner you lost control on
the ship it became too hard to move
because everything was scaled down to
lower level acceleration he'd cross over
and then you try and turn you'd feel
like you're just drifting forever
it's that week we we wanted to fix that
immediately I mean that wasn't the
intended goal we wanted to have it
slower to get to their velocities but
still keep control so I had to play
around with all of the different scaling
values to make sure that the maneuvering
thrusters weren't affected but it was
just the main thrusters that were
affected so it would take longer to get
there and then also give like a buff to
the
to the retro thrusters if you imagine
you were shunting all the power with a
thrust capacity to the front to stop you
faster that's kind of the idea we're
going with you it's when you cross into
the atmosphere you'll you'll feel like
you've got more control to stop whereas
the terminal velocity in the max safe
speed will also restrict your velocity
and slow you down it was also the
afterburner scaling that would that
would help you get there faster
so while big ships like the caterpillar
will still have an issue coming into an
atmosphere and stopping in time if
you're pushing it because it's cut such
limited control once you get into the
atmosphere smaller vessels should be
able to get in there and stop and not
have an issue but finding that right
balance was the challenge not making
them too powerful not making them too
weak we had to have a lot of back and
forth or QA on that and probably more
with PTU to come the future plans we do
have things that we want to do so even
things like the thruster effects which
went without long standing thruster
effects in our game we want to bring in
some visual differences to them when
you're in the atmosphere so one example
will be we've got shop diamonds in some
of our those three effects that you
actually see in space now technically
speaking you would receive shock
diamonds when you're not in atmosphere
so for a long time we've wanted to
actually play around with that and
actually have little details that only
appear when you're in atmosphere so not
necessarily really clear like really
obvious things but just sold iffen PSA's
so there's all kinds of things we want
to do along those lines here in the
future at this point we don't have the
app the full atmospheric simulation
which includes weather systems in place
so I've put in a placeholder system that
simulates wind initially actually had
storms for what an earlier demo but I
pulled that out for the three oh release
we won't need that but we will have some
variation of wind based on altitude
and and wind direction which is
consistent based on your location you
know within the sphere of a planet so
everyone will have the same wind as well
as wind gusts you know that can reach
you know fairly high velocity so if
you're flying along and you know wind is
flung and going in one direction you're
going to feel stronger drag in that
direction but if you're flying with the
wind you'll feel less drag the ship will
be work nobody's working as hard you
know in order to fly with the wind
versus against the wind
there definitely is wind turbulence and
so the more the wind blows you know kind
of shake the the ship gonna push it
around a little bit you know when you
get into really high wind or high gust
conditions which you can at places
you'll feel it more now this is all
based on the kind of pristine state of
the ship so a ship when it comes in it's
it's designed so that it's center of
drag is fairly aligned with its center
of mass so there's not a lot of drag
that comes from from a lot of torque
that comes from the drag on the ship but
if you blow off a wing or whatever and
it shifts the center of drag relative
the center of mass then you have this
moment arm right so so when the drag
forces is applied to the ship it tends
to push it you know to torque it around
you know we have thrusters which
aircraft don't have we have we have
thrusters available and so they're
always countering that and they'll try
to keep you as best as they can it would
keep you from from spinning around and
just going out of control which is what
you would do if we you know if it was
just an aircraft but at some point when
you've taken damage your thrusters
you're not gonna have that ability so if
you fly slow enough you'll be fine but
if you fly too fast you'll find yourself
just completely you know spinning out of
control
Chris really wants it that you can
basically hit aerodynamic limits like if
you take a plane in real life and you
like fly it at high speeds toward the
ground and then pull off the wings
eventually we'll reach a point where
they're like no we can't do this anymore
and they'll just break off and I think
that's what Chris would wants us to get
towards it's quite complicated to try
and work out where those forces are
because we don't have like a full-on
fluid simulation that you would have in
like professional flight simulator and
in simulations like that it's quite easy
to be like well you know this force here
on this point but we
we do that so we have to still come up
with a solution for how to do that you
know you know in a realistic but also
suitable for the game and suitable to
fit in with the rest of the game and
then we'll have will pretty much have
that air dynamic like failures where
parts of the ship just can't take the
pressure anymore they'll just break off
right now we're kind of in between with
with the atmospheric model we did a
first pass on it that got the ships
flying in the atmosphere fairly quickly
but it's not as accurate a flight model
as as we want
after 3.0 is out I'll be introducing a
new flight model which will improve it
quite a bit I think right now the main
thing that players will feel when
they're flying is the difference in the
amount of acceleration available because
of drag and things like that right and
the turbulence that's applied to the
ship but it still won't feel as
different from spaceflight as as what we
want and that's coming next as you can
see the physics and control systems are
going to make for a very visceral in
atmosphere experience that's all for
this week
