everyone welcome to bug smashers and
back in action to show you guys a fun
book let's take a look everyone we are
here in the awesome PU level and this
week we're taking a look at the fun
issue of performance yay and a broken
ship so this is our fun little Cutlass
and it's cool let's spawn a few more
because why not do we spawn a few cut
cuts they're all freaking out like crazy
because they're all smiling the right
spot why not cool um now that actually
looks pretty nifty
now when you expect before mins fun
we're hearing part all the star and well
there's a bunch of ships here and they
they're all flying around chittering
about you expect well yeah they should
update but if I traverse all the way to
once I find all these fun console
commands let's go to
or yella like hype whoo
if you notice on the top left all of
those cutlasses that I spawn are still
updating even though it's miles and
miles and miles and miles away that's a
problem because if we want to have a
bunch of players in the good old server
we don't need them to update for me when
they're far far away I don't care about
an EM 50 or Cutlass battling across the
galaxy they're eating my CPU cycles and
damn it I want my CPU cycles so let's
fix that let's stop the game because I
won't be able to recode that Shazam
the first thing we're gonna do is here's
our component for the movement flight
movement it's very basic all it does is
has an initializer and then we update
you get the vehicle and then we start
updating ifcs on this batch update in
the specific frame of the entity system
and in the update we basically batch a
bunch of updates and they all get
spawned and get processed as many
processors as you have so during the
frame we're like hey everything go
update and we just go crazy the benefit
is that instead of having one pass and
going one at a time if you go like
sixteen twenty hundred updates in a row
quite efficient but this guy is set to
always update that means if he's far
away he's gonna update no matter what we
have a whole slew of updates but the one
that we care about is actually this
thing called in range in range is
basically it's not necessarily invisible
but if it's potentially visible that
could be able to be behind me side left
right it will get an update so if I'm
battling some guy the guy in front of me
and he goes behind me he'll still update
because well we need him to continue
flying now that's good gone BAM cool but
that's gonna cause some problems and IFC
especially since we do some Network tix
that no longer happened
so what we want to do is let me copy
pasta some functions that's some awesome
functions in here we want to know
specifically when we go in and range and
out of range so that we could tell ifcs
hey once you've gone out of range stop
moving go and then tell physics to go to
sleep then when we come back we want to
reset the network tick so that we snap
to the latest information so I'm gonna
add these two fun little functions Sam
these little functions allowing my
component to register for certain events
and when I get the event I could do some
fun magic so let's add these fun little
functions
Shazaam forgot my functions now I need
to register for some events so let's go
find the magical events we have a whole
slew of them - that we want or enter
range and in range now the coolest thing
about the inter ranging and leave range
is if on a client if something the range
is basically where Mike where I am so I
don't have to care about the m50 far
away but the in range on the server is
where all the players are so technically
if I'm all the way over here and there's
another play over here both the stuff in
these areas will update on the server
but only the one where I am will update
on my client kind of a nifty thing that
allows the game code to work
specifically for the things that we care
about things that aren't in range or
don't need an update shouldn't get an
update get our CPU cycles back through
so we registered for in range and out of
range
so let's process those
get my vehicle tell the vehicle
we went our vehicle know that hey we've
entered the range that's a new function
on rain change we'll just have a truth
we've gone in and then we'll have a
false floor
I don't know we've got out of the range
now this doesn't exist so we have to add
it to fun old interfaces cool what's to
use the longest variable has done on
range diggity Doo yay so if this is true
we are in range and we should start
processing now let's add it to our
spaceship magical spaceship our
spaceship this is our movement for the
spaceship he has all the fun stuff for
ifcs
and updating where the ship should go so
we need to forward this information well
to the spaceship or ifcs
magical wonder of ifcs what we have to
go into us yes
oh the fun of programming one thing said
something has a long chain this is what
we do all day every day this is the easy
part
ok so now we have our flight and if we
are in range
we basically want to reset ifcs I should
say the network that and then here we
want to disable basically physics and go
to sleeps so first thing we need to do
is make sure that we have let's let's
turn in let's make a go to sleep first
so we need the physical entity this is
the physics the rigidbody this would be
like the cup or with spaceships on it so
we need to tell physics piece ship
physics this is where are you do owner
get me the physics owner is this ship we
want to tell the ship to action where
are you since velocity you want to clear
the linear velocity zero that out
later the angular velocity aha
so linear angular
type piece ship physics go to sad
never said action no it's an action
there it is go to bed this will clear
the velocity and now we need to tell to
go to sleep
cram position I am this position sim
class we are gonna go to Pam cool so
this basically tells the ship to go to
bed another thing we need to do is that
should be fine
now once we have gone to sleep if a ship
comes into range we now need to wake him
up so for the server its reset this will
reset the network and we need to reset
our prediction what this does is if the
server gets into a state where the ship
comes back into view a reset this
network state and everyone will snap and
then on the clients we set this
prediction so it snaps to either the
client or server latest information so
let's compile see the wonderful errors
that we get back with some magical code
compiling and I spun myself a cutlass my
spawn a few more just for fun we always
spawn inside each other but
Shazaam so there's the cutlasses they're
updating moving around like crazy ifcs
is doing their thing on top left we are
getting our fun updates now let's check
out the code in action if i teleport to
yellow they should no longer update oh
they don't update there's no debug text
I get my CPU cycles back everyone's
happy FPS is high today's a good day and
what's great is the server's not
updating those until teleport over there
till I go over there now if there was
another client over here and then I
teleport away that server would update
them because well they need to move
because they are controlled by good old
server guys enjoy that's today's fun
optimization alright so as you guys saw
we had a fun little performance issue as
we try to cram more and more players
into the server we're constantly
debugging profiling trying to find out
all the things that are taking most time
on the server and we're nailing those
out so we could add more and more for
more players to the the game and
unfortunately the ships they've been in
the game for a long long time because
it's well spaced game and you know there
was not so many optimizations in there
cuz we were just like getting you know
get it up and running cool but when you
start adding more players we don't need
to do all these updates so guys way way
out on oblivion we don't need to be
updating ifcs because well they're
light-years away from you so we had a
little bit of code in there to make sure
that those guys far away kind of go into
this little hibernation mode until they
get within range and then BAM they're up
and running and you're able to dogfight
with them hope you guys enjoyed until
next time thank you for watching so if

greatest in star citizen the squadron 42
