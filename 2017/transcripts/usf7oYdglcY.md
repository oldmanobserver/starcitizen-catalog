Hey everyone, welcome to Bug Smashers.
I'm your host Mark Abit. Let's take a
look at some
bugs. Bug Smashers.
Hey everyone, we are here in the fun
little test level for the SC item 2.0
constellation. And what we see here is a
list of all the items and their
individual components. Um, so with the
item 2.0 infrastructure, we could have
uh some entity like my hand, and it
could be composed of physics, it could
be composed of an item, it could be
composed of a power plant, a weapon
system, or even a seat. So, all five of
those components basically make our
entity. And in the case of uh this
constellation, we have a turret. And
this bad boy is composed of a bunch of
components. And this is our whole new
item 2.0 entity 2.0 system where we have
our turret, which is an item. It has
these individual components, geometry,
physics, animation, and our actual item
logic. So we have here a dashboard. Uh
this is the thing that we will see in
front of you that has all the screens.
It has a turret params. This is the
thing that you need to move and rotate
uh this guy around. He has a seat. This
is basically the interface to uh the
ship saying, "Hey, I am a person sitting
in here. Give me control of stuff." And
then finally, we have the weapon
controller. This allows you to be able
to shoot stuff. So ideally when you plop
one of these down into a ship, you could
get in it, play some animations, gain
control of some awesome weapons, and
let's see what happens. So I am going to
sit down, fast forward all the
animations. And as you can see, um, some
of this debug text is kind of turned a
different color. So we have, um, an
editor player which is basically in
blue. That's me. I just sat down in the
seat and he's gained control of you can
see right above the read me uh replace
me ball. I've gained control of the
seat, the turret and the weapon
controller. So all these components that
I have in here, I've gained control of
them except our weapon controller has
not gained any weapons. So where are our
weapons? They should
be There they are. So, we have this
weapon gun that's on the hard point of
the turret, but unfortunately, we're not
gaining control of anything. That's on
the very far right. We have turret right
and turret left. So, what's happening?
Well, let's take a look even further.
Um, so here's our ship XML. This
basically says, "Hey, here's everything
you need to know about a ship." And we
have these things called controller defs
blocks which basically define um some
set of parameters of who is going to
control what. So for this seat when a um
user sits down he'll take control of the
turret itself. Um and
then we he will also be able the turret
itself will also take control over
itself. Again, it's kind of weird, but
the way that the code is set up is
um this user defaf is basically the
seat. So, when the player sits down,
he'll gain control of the seat. And then
it's usable. Um since the seat now says,
"Hey, this person has got in. What else
could he can control?" That's the second
block. And then he'll be able to control
basically his dashboard, his turret, and
even his weapon controller. That's why
it's kind of set up this way. The reason
why it's also set up this way is because
yes, you could have these components all
built in the item, but you could
actually separate them out and have them
um subcomponents underneath connected um
item ports. So, it's kind of a weird
setup because the system allows you to
be very
flexible. And this turret has
um uh we go back to this guy. We have an
item which has some item
ports and those item ports. We could set
up a gun and we could also set up
another gun on the other item
port. So on these item ports we have
some weapons, but unfortunately we're
not getting control of them. Why? Well,
um let's go back here. as you're saying
that we set up these um priorities of
who could gain control based on these
things called controllable tags. And
when we snap um these weapons on it,
well, we're not gaining anything. As you
can see, we're looking for these weapon
guns, but we only take control of them.
So, by default, we have no control
unless they have the tag uh the lower
turret tag. So, we've assumed that these
weapons that attach on to us are going
to have the same tag as us.
unfortunately don't. So, let's make sure
that that happens. And the reason we
want to do that is so that if we have
the same turret copied and pasted in a
few spots, all we have to do is set the
tag here and then everything underneath
gets it. So, in the code, whenever we
add this um new component, so we don't
do things entity levelwise, we do things
component-wise. So, when each of these
get attached, we handle them
independently. So, we don't care if
they're on another entity or all in this
guy. We basically get the item port and
get its tag and then we use that. But,
as you can see, the weapons are on we
have the weapons and then the um turret.
They're attached onto it. So, there's
nothing to describe what flags or tags
that these guys should have. So what we
can do is enable this bit of
code and as recode runs what this will
say is if we are not directly attached
to the ship that means we're going to go
all the way up to our parent. So for
this weapon we're going to go to the
parent we're going to get its tag and
use that. So what this will allow us to
do is those weapons that get attached we
use this tag so that the weapon
controller could gain control of them.
So, we'll let Recode do its thing and
I'll sip some
coffee. Aha! Recode has done its thing.
We're going to snap out of the
turret. Fly back up to the
top. We're going to enter again. Fast
forward. Now we got gained control of
everything again. Now see if we gain
control. Yep. And now we have gained
control of our weapons so we can fire
them as we please. Pew pew
pew. Well, hope you guys enjoyed this
sneak peek. Till next time. So, as you
guys saw, we had a fun little bug where
we have these new setup with the turrets
where they're all mashed together and
we're just adding a bunch of components.
We slap it on the seat and we only get
control of the seat. None of the
weapons. We can't even get control of
the dashboard, so we can't get out. It
was simple as making sure that we add
tags to each into those components. So
when we slap it on, we sit down, we take
control of ourselves, and then we can
get in out as we please, shoot all the
weapons, and have a good time. Hope you
guys enjoyed. Until next
time. Thank you for watching. So, if you

42's development, please follow us on
