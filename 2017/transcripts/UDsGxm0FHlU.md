hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers
let's smash some
bugs bug
smashes hey everyone we are here in and
the good old pu and there's port allar
and there's um Planet Mark Planet Mark
is awesome so next to uh Good Old Port
allar we have a fun bug where uh when we
spawn into a ship in
multiplayer um we have this bit of code
that the player is informed that he's
linked to the seat and he's also linked
to we call it the control manager or the
vehicle um we link it so that we know
internally that hey we're on a vehicle
hey we're on a seat seat so some code in
different directions could do their
thing cuz you know we have to do
different things if you're sitting down
in a seat uh if you have a gun or
something so when you sit down on all
the machines this bit of code should
hook it up just let everybody know that
you are linked correctly and
unfortunately uh if I step through
here spawn ourselves into an awesome
ship let's Spa a cutless
Shazam the server is fine it will run
through set the vehicle everyone's
happy the client on the other hand as
soon as he gets to this link State he
will have an attachable component and as
soon as he tries to attach to the EDM
Port it ends because well it doesn't
know what's happening why well um o
we're getting detached now because I
think we guys died yep we died uh
spawning a ship into another ship but
before that what's happening uh well
when we have our Network replication uh
we make sure that we have a priority
thing in the sense that we have the ship
the seat and then the player and we make
sure the ship spawns before the seat
before the player however what's
happening is when the seat spawns in it
is aware that the this player should be
attached to it because it's through our
serialization before the seat can attach
to the ship it has known that the player
should attach to it so it attaches the
player so now the player's attached then
we attach it to the seat and because of
this weird ordering thing um the when
the by the time the actor is aware that
he's attached to the seat he's not
attached to a ship this update only
happens once so he never gets informed
that now he's attaching to a ship so the
fir little bit of fun uh the fix is
actually pretty simple uh we have here
our little seat code and anytime we
detach or attach we need to
inform um basically the actor that we
are now in uh the seat so we're going to
check our seat Flags if we have any
Flags
es check all the flags we have an N link
Shazam did
I mistype there we go so now when we've
attached the ship onto the vehicle we
need to update this
function so
ha so what am I doing here um so we have
this interface where the seat is a where
that is attached to
something and when we attach the seat
we're going to check to see if the seat
has a player in it that's what this bit
will do and if it does have a player
we're going to reinform the player that
you're now attached to a seat attached
to a vehicle so now everyone should be
good to go let's hit the magic recode
button and see where this takes us
recode recode recode recode recode
recode okay
all right recode is finished we revived
ourselves through the building because
why
not uh we have Port allar there again
we're going to spawn oursel cutless
Shazam and it probably would help if I
actually set up break point so that we
could see that this is happening
so we're going to spawn into another
cutless so this is the server we know
that works
wait for the network aha now we are the
client and as we step through the first
time we're attached to the seat don't
have a um vehicle fair enough then now
we attach the vehic the seat to the
vehicle and then now we have a link woo
and the client code is working as
intended we are establishing that hey we
got a vehicle everyone want should know
about it and everyone's good to go
continue and Shazam we are in our cut
lless watching all the shaders compile
because why not there's another cutless
there we got our fun
UI and I want to be able to shoot him
so
ha yeah blow up all the things die
slow death slow
death Beautiful
Death screw it it's taking too long
we'll
Ram now we're inside of the other ship
features so now the um the code
recognizes that we are in a vehicle
everyone's happy all the internal
systems know that we're in a vehicle so
they can all handle their little B bitty
stuff behind the scenes hope you guys
enjoyed this one it's a fun one so as
you guys saw we had a fun little bug
where um we have our seat the player
sits in it and then sometime later he
gets attached to the vehicle due to the
way the network orders all that fun
Shenanigans but because of that weird
Oddity um the player was informed that
he was attached to the seat but he was
not informed that he was attached to the
vehicle so a lot of weird cat in the
back end assumed that we're just
attached to a seat not a vehicle and it
didn't run right uh so switched the code
around so that we inform that we're on a
seat and then when we get onto a vehicle
we update saying hey we're now on a
vehicle everyone's happy everything's
good to go hope you guys enjoyed I know
the code liked it hope you did too till
next time this is bug Smashers thank you
