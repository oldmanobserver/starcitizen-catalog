Hello and welcome to Around the Verse,
our weekly look at the development of
Star Citizen. I'm Sandy Gardner.
And I'm for Stefan. Uh for the past
week, you've been intercepting messages
about a top secret ship in development.
Here's the latest transmission.

As you probably guessed, the ship in
development is the Aegis Eclipse. And
starting tomorrow, the eclipse will be
available as part of our latest concept
sale. You can check the comm link
tomorrow to learn all about the eclipse,
its role, and its history.
And in today's show, we will see how
story and tone can be reinforced through
the art of lighting. But first, let's go
to the Los Angeles for their studio
update. Hi, and welcome back to Los
Angeles. I'm senior producer Eric Kaine
Davis here with your monthly studio
update. This month, we've made great
strides and finished a variety of tasks
across both projects, and the team here
in Los Angeles continued to grow, which
really helped us knock things out
quickly. Now, in the past, we've talked
all about item system 2.0 and its
impacts on the myriad of game features.
Regarding its impact specifically on
ships, it is an improvement to how
players can interact with ships and
their systems, such as how adjustments
to item settings can affect gameplay.
Now, our tech design, engineering, and
QA teams have made steady progress in
their various disciplines. Now, in our
endeavor to reach the goal of rolling
out a fleet of item system 2.0 ships
with updated or new items that can be
loaded onto them, we've now successfully
converted the Origin M50 Interceptor to
fully utilize this new system. We've
chose to start with this ship because
it's the least complex example while
still allowing us to discover issues
that we can address for all 49 flyable
ships and beyond. It's been the perfect
test monkey. No offense, M50 pilots. And
you've probably learned from your own
experiences that one tends to be a bit
more meticulous the first time you
attempt something. We do the same thing
at Star Citizen by properly documenting
all necessary steps, thereby creating
guides to speed up future processes. And
now in our first round through, we also
look to identify opportunities to create
tools further speeding up our overall
implementation time. And this attention
to detail has really allowed us to
balance power usage, heat generation, uh
associate EM and IR signals, and balance
hydrogen and quantum fuel consumption.
This will also give players a reason to
consider upgrading their ship components
and make multiplayer gameplay a bit more
rewarding. Now, QA aided with this
conversion by taking an early look at
the ship and determined how to convert
all existing checklists to the new 2.0
framework. When making any impact to our
game, QA has to test everything, which
in this case included all the different
interaction points. Now, prior to the
interaction points, it was limited to
just testing enter and exits, but checks
were added for ladder enter exits, entry
enter exits, power on and off, engines
on and off, as well as looking ahead for
features not yet implemented, such as
ejections and cases which more than one
player attempts a particular
interaction. Now, the engineering team
has also made strides in the areas of
persistence and inventory. They're
currently working on creating a
technique for clients to request
persistent information. This work
supports several large features in 3.0,
including cargo, shops, commodities, air
traffic control, ships, players, and a
whole lot more. It will allow game code
to query for a modified data for entries
that aren't even spawned, such as
selling cargo for a ship that's landed
at a station and hidden away from ATC.
These features will also allow game code
to correctly respawn and orient ships or
items that have been abandoned on
planets or in space. Meaning you can
expect the world and your possessions to
remain in the same state in between game
sessions. Unless, of course, a pesky
pirate comes along and does what pesky
pirates do. Now, we've also made
progress on the system which allows one
to park their ship inside of another.
This should be pretty straightforward as
possible and result in being able to
transport any stowable ship safely from
point A to point B. This was based off
of a rework of the landing mechanic that
is currently in game. Now, the new
docking areas are set up the exact same
way as landing pads used within the
current universe, taking components with
a different interface and a new
mechanism for locking. There has also
been some work on the physics of getting
the Ursa rover to sit inside the cargo
bay of the constellation Andromeda
without it popping through the walls and
jittering. So in other words, hopefully
physics won't go wild and blow
everything up, literally. Now the team
also now has converted the basic quantum
drive to item system 2.0, giving it the
ability to store quantum travel and
other nav points. This means that all
discovered quantum travel points are
able to be set as travel destinations
for use at any time regardless of
distance and signature strength. Now,
the next goal is to make quantum drive
look and sound as awesome as it behaves
by connecting the VFX and the audio to
the actual transit. This also involves
working closely with design on a way to
better display them to a player in a
logical interface. And then from here,
we can move on to pure 2.0. 0 systems as
Quantum Dry now uses the pipe system for
fuel and for power checks. Now, also
this month, we've implemented a few new
features into our IFCS or intelligent
flight control system. On the physics
side, we've now implemented an autopilot
system to allow our AI and any other
system to utilize IFCS like takeoff,
landing, or quantum drive or anywhere a
ship control really needs to be
automated. And we've also added some
support for cinematics to be able to
automate the motion of thrusters on
ships. So they don't need to hand
animate every thruster action in a
cinematic. The thrusters on a ship will
now behave as intelligently as they do
in our current game. Now our ship team
has been making very steady progress on
the RSI Aurora since our last update.
The art team has now completed the seat
geo for the ES and LN variants and be
begun work on the engines while tech
design is implementing these new assets
utilizing the item system 2.0 framework
directly into the ship archetype making
this our first first scratchuilt item
system 2.0 ship. Also, the Anvil
Terrapin's exterior is nearing
completion of the graybox phase and has
near final animation. Our tech content
team continues to improve performance by
automating and improving processes. As
you know, the scale of Star Citizen is
such that even large teams need some
additional support in the form of
outsourcing partners. One of the
difficulties with outsourcing tends to
be ensuring a team's refined processes
are adhered to and assets delivered meet
all requirements for simple integration
into our game. As you've heard in the
past, there are many pipelines and
processes within Star Citizen and some
of them are more complicated than
others. onboarding and outsourcing team
requires that the tools can be installed
and run in an external environment with
limited support from us really in order
to save time. So this month the tech
animation team developed a standalone
installer that automatically mounts
sample assets, tools, and documentation.
No matter if it's for motion builder or
for Maya, we can now easily bring
onboard any potential partners quickly,
saving both them and us time. as well as
these same partners benefit from our
extensive internal tool development that
we did for our own needs. Tech animation
is also responsible for character
skeletons. And like all things, creating
a character skeleton can be done
manually or automatically. Typically in
the games, the rig is not really that
complex, nor does it change often. Thus,
the manual approach could actually save
time. But when you're on the cutting
edge of technology, updates are often
required. For example, an animation
engineer may require the addition of a
specifically named joint for code
purposes, thus requiring changes to all
skeletons in the game. This would be
very timeconuming if done manually. But
we've now completed our SRC or source
rigging scripts and can make these kind
of updates quickly, easily, and
bug-free. The time and energy saved is
not only for the rigging team, but also
for the animation team who will be
utilizing these skeletons day after day.
Now, a programming analogy would be to
think of the rig as a compiled
executable. The SRC rigging scripts are
the source code. So, if we need to add
something to the skeleton, we update the
source code and compile it rather than
patching the executable. You would just
really build a new. Now, changing gears
a little bit. Up until now, you may have
noticed all of our characters eyes have
been more or less the same, but the tech
art team has created a new data
structure that will allow players to
customize their eye color. This supports
the first pass of the character creator
where players will be able to select
from a preset color palette.
[Music]
Now, the tech art team has also taken
advantage of a feature recently provided
by the LA engineering team. Through the
magic of item port tags, the body skin
tone will now automatically adjust to
the skin tone of the face. In the case
of NPCs, this will make maintain
consistency for our characters. And in
the case of players, this will ensure
your body always matches your face.
Also, they've created uh a process to
generate SDF or signed distance field
volume textures which are used in
conjunction with our atmospheric flight
model to simulate engine trails. We've
made solid progress on art tools for our
various art teams. And one such tool is
our unbevel tool, which simplifies LODs
or level of details creation process to
increase performance on anything beyond
our first LOD and speed up the delivery
time for our ship pipeline. We've also
taken large steps forward on our
procedural system for outposts,
including color tinting, material
variation, and even variation of props
and their placement within the outposts.
Lastly, our tech art and character team
have added more armor to the armory with
a fully rigged female medium marine as
well as a male heavy outlaw suit that
we've shown in previous updates going
from now concept all the way into final
implementation.
We're also far along on many new
uniforms, costumes, characters, and
heads. The male OMC light is wrapping up
its initial high poly pass and moved
onto in-game mesh creation. The male
Schuban minor uniform has moved to
in-game texturing now that the in-game
mesh is complete. And a new shipjacker
uniform for Squadron 42 just finished up
concepting and is on its way to high
poly. Our female marine BDU finished up
sculpting and is now headed to in-game
modeling. And with the FOV slider work
in progress for 3.0, The character team
is doing a bit of work on our helmet
interior, starting with the heavy outlaw
and the heavy marine, which is used by
our UI team to establish necessary
boundaries. Well, that wraps us up for
this month's update. We really enjoy
bringing you these in-depth looks into
our progress. Thank you so much for your
support and see you again next time.
Thanks, Eric. It's great to see all the
detail going into character
customization, even down to eye color.
Yes, we really want to give the players
the ability to create unique characters
and this is just the start. As Star
Citizen grows, so will the possibilities
for character customization.
It's all about building a believable
universe. And one very important way to
do that is through lighting, use of
shadow and fog to help set a scene,
which is why our lighting team is
building a tool that can handle a game
as large as Star Citizen. Uh, take a
look. It's pretty cool.
My name's Emry Schwitzer. I'm a lighting
artist here at Cloud Bureum Games.
Hello, my name is Nate. I'm the vehicle
art director here at Foundry 42.
I'm Chris Campbell. I'm lead lighting
artist at Foundry 42 in Frankfurt.
Hi. Uh my name is Maria. I'm the
lighting artist for Star Citizen.
I'm Ben. I'm a graphics programmer and
by habit I've sort of become the
volutrics and the lighting kind of guy.
Lighting in general, um, my my opinion
of it is is pretty much the most
important pass. It goes into an
environment or a ship or or or a planet
before it goes out the door.
Bad lighting can make good assets look
terrible or good lighting can make bad
assets quite nice. Actually,
you can have substandard assets and and
light it well. We don't make substandard
assets, so we're pretty lucky with with
with really good quality to start with,
but it is the basis of it's not just the
cake, it's the cake and the cherry on
top. Lighting is the the character of
the scene. It it creates this feeling of
like either glooiness or or happiness.
You can use lighting and and color as a
way to uh to create a um a continual
story line uh from start to finish. So
like a story can start warm and happy
and then by the end it can feel cold and
and more bluish and stuff like that. And
that's all told through lighting. We
started um with essentially Cry Engine
which is now Lumberiard quite a long
time ago. Uh and the game and the engine
was very focused to delivering a certain
type of scenario. So it was out of the
box really good at creating outdoor
environments. It had a a sun time of day
system. Interiors it wasn't so good. Um
it kind of fell down a lot of areas. You
could certainly get good results with it
but it was very kind of cumbersome. Its
lighting systems were mainly built for
either large open like smallish levels
up to about 4 km. It didn't really
account for
uh really dynamic worlds. So over the
years we've tried our best to cater the
engine to something that will scale and
and scale from your little basement
under the stairs to drawing a whole
galaxy. So that's like the ultimate
challenge.
The the scale of our lighting is is
really interesting. the sun uh is a
light source all the way down to like a
small decorative light on on a table or
something like that. We we try and keep
the the power of those lights in
relative terms. So obviously the sun
needs to feel hundreds or thousands of
times more powerful than a little desk
lamp. And that creates interesting
questions for like how the camera auto
exposure works. So, how like it feels
when you when you come from a small dark
room and walk into like a a brightly lit
exterior like on the surface of a planet
or something that uh we need to create
that feeling that uh there's a real
difference of intensity between these
lighting sources. In Star Citizen, the
idea is that you'll be able to go up and
literally shoot out every single light
in an environment and the environment
has to be able to react to that. So,
how do you build that using the existing
tech? We we couldn't. So, we had to
retool a lot of things. You know,
there's all these variables now at play
and and the tech wasn't there. So, a lot
of the the improvements that the
graphics team has been working on has
been to allow those things to exist.
We're we're kind of like halfway there,
I'd say. Um, we've we've approached many
different uh things in in several
different ways. So, for example, last
year, I think sometime you saw the
animal for screen space flares come in.
Again, that's tied to the lighting
system. Um we've got on horizon
real-time cube map generation. The whole
sun system that we had um has gone. Um
there is one sun in the galaxy uh which
will light all of the planets. So
there's there's the guys in Frankfurt
obviously who are developing the the
planetary tools and the lighting system
for all the planetary tools are in the
planetary tools I should say. So, it's
it's completely driven by by the
atmosphere of the planets. And for a for
an artist to get his head around all
that at times, it's pretty challenging,
but it's it's good fun.
We do use lighting for uh for creating a
a change in the in the physical like in
the player character as well. Not not
normally in the the lights themselves,
but through things like color grading
and and post effects on the camera. Uh
which generally falls underneath the the
lighting umbrella as well. So changing
the the color of the screen like either
desaturating it or or adding more
contrast and stuff like that. That's uh
that's part of lighting as well. Like if
the player is hurt or injured then the
color grading can react in in the way
that uh that it either desaturates or or
uh makes the color more vivid or
something like that.
When it comes to the ships then you're
talking really about a different set of
challenges. All the lighting in the
ships is 100% dynamic um and 100%
physically correct. Hence, we have a
physically based rendering system.
You do want to have some sort of
feedback loop with the artists. Um to to
make sure that the light bulbs are
positioned properly to, you know, just
just make sure that even within a small
ship like that, your eye is looking at,
you know, specific things that you want
to call, right? If there's a turret
somewhere, you want to know that the
turrets there. It's not hidden away in
darkness. Um, so there's definitely call
outs that that we notice, but it's also,
you know, a collaborative effort going
back and talking to the designers and
the artists and making sure that, you
know, if there's a component that you
interact with on a wall that you know
that that component's there and maybe
it's flashing if it's, you know, damaged
or something, right?
The challenge with that is you kind of
need these tools put in place um to to
make that happen. Now, what was
happening up until a few weeks ago now,
we we have a layering system. So, um,
you'd essentially group lights into
small groups and switch them on and off
at different times during the ship's
state. So, if it was in an emergency
state, you'd switch the default state on
uh off, sorry, and then switch the
emergency state on. Now, that kind of
works in theory, but it has a lot of a
lot of problems with it. First problem
is your your your cry file or your
lumbumberard file ends up being
obscenely big because we have thousands
upon thousands of lights. Um that
essentially 3/4 of them most of the time
are switched off and the transition
between one state to the other is is
kind of it's on and then it's off. Um so
you can walk around the world today, you
can come into this room, you can switch
switch these office lights on and
they'll have a distinct style when they
switch on. um they might flicker if
they're an LED. They might come up to a
a temperature and cycle through a
temperature color. We have temperature
charts that we use that's that's in the
engine. So, it's completely correct. And
that kind of negates things going wrong
color-wise. So, we we wanted a system
where we could we could transition from
on in a very creative manner to
different states. So, whether that's
evacuation or auxiliary or even to off,
we now have a light grouping system so
that each room has its own power state.
So you can go in, you can enable or
disable power to a specific room. You
can that room can take damage and now
maybe that has to be put into an
emergency state.
That controller is creating these
transitions for for me as the artist to
control. So when ship A takes damage at
location B, like everything within that
radius of location start to use starts
to use this system. And when you
actually see it working, it's it's
really quite powerful. Um, and it goes
to show how powerful lighting is because
you can completely change a really
ambient soft feeling environment into
something that feels very very
aggressive extremely extremely quickly
just through light alone, not nothing
else.
I mean, the the challenge is is finding
that right balance. I mean, if if things
are out of whack, then it can feel like
uh when you when you leave a small
interior and the interior is too
brightly lit, then all of a sudden the
sun feels really underwhelming by
comparison. Or vice versa, if if it's uh
really bright outside and you walk into
a really dimly lit interior, then it's
just pitch black and it just doesn't it
doesn't feel very uh immersive or
helpful for the player if you can't see
where you're going.
I think that there's a general vibe that
every single level tries to achieve. You
know, there's some levels that are
vibrant and and you want to be welcome
there. You you or the goal of the art
director is to make you feel welcome
there. Um it's a nice calm place. And
then there's the other side of things
where it's tense and it's you know
something like Grim Hex where stepping
in there you kind of kind of you might
want to watch your back, right? Um so
there's definitely different moods that
the environments want to convey and
lighting plays a huge role in that. It
all kind of starts out as a concept.
There's some ideas thrown around. Then
the design team goes in and blocks out
the environment and gets an idea for the
forms and the shapes uh as well as the
gameplay and the pathing the players are
going to take. And then art goes in and
kind of details it using all of our
modular sets that don't necessarily mesh
together very well. Then they do decal
passes and prop passes to kind of bring
it all together. But then lighting is
really the thing that that kind of makes
all those elements of the environment
cohesive. It blends all of the different
assets that we have together and guides
the player in the right direction and
enhances gameplay as well as just
overall makes the general composition of
the level as good as it can be.
Lighting also heavily affects or heavily
impacts um visual effects uh because
things like particles aren't aren't
normally directly lit in the same way
that basic geometry is lit. Uh they in
our game they receive lighting from from
direct light sources and also from cube
maps to to give them a kind of an
ambient lighting feel. Uh but that's
that's not always it doesn't always look
directly the same as as the environment
might look. And so there's a lot of
balancing and back and forth between the
visual effects artists that they that
they tweak their uh their particles to
the same level that the that the
lighting looks and vice versa that we
also try and keep that in mind so that
we don't create a a situation where
nothing can work.
So basically uh what starts here is like
all the uh interior area is ready. Of
course, for now it's purely dark and the
as the rule for lighting artist is once
we light on the room, we're going to
tell the space. But how we light up this
thing is basically uh introduced by the
atmosphere from our art director. So
here is a good example from our art
director. So basically this is a uh the
lighting setup before and this is what
we are trying to achieve. So according
here is like because we have the
different version of the light.
Basically we have three different
version of the light. Uh first one is
like it's a fake light light source
which going to trigger the uh emission
power. So here is a light feature and
what we do is like we linked it with the
uh emission power to turn them on. So
obviously each space once they have the
feature the light should comes from the
direction of the feature. However, uh in
this industry, what we did is like we
have this lighting feature first which
going to control the uh image ship map
and then we have another actual light
going to tell this space like where the
light comes from uh from this spot
direction.
And after we set up all this space, we
were trying to push like different color
for car and warm. And once I turned
around the fork, I will try to get them
even closer with the uh guidance from
the art director. So basically that is
how we work.
Uh usually once I've done the lighting,
I'm going to just do the uh character
testing cuz character is a very
important part of the game. So usually
once I done the lighting setup, I'll
just use this test feature to see and
walking around and make sure like in
different positions. Those light going
to cast the character correctly and
they're going to able to see this
character and also uh we have two
different light setup. The one is like a
cold light like you can see casting from
the H exit of the door. It's very cold.
So in that case I designed some like
warm light to make sure the character
always have different code and warm tone
to make the image looks more
interesting.
There's new lighting tools created on a
probably a weekly basis at this point.
Um we've we've just recently uh
integrated a first pass of our lit fog
technology which is basically a way of
transferring old fog which is very kind
of uh I mean it has depth but it feels
quite flat in the way that it renders
the scene. Um but this new technology
allows us to basically gives you a sense
of where the light comes from or like
light sources can actually cast light
into the scene from uh from their
source. At the moment, the the old fog
doesn't react to lights in any way. So,
what an artist will have done is they'll
have put fog in an area and they'll have
sort of set the color and the thickness
of it to roughly approximate what it
would have looked like if it had had
lighting on it. So, as an example, if
someone's put a red light in a room,
they'll probably have put some red fog
in there to go with. What they're
actually trying to get the impression of
is some very thin white fog with a
really strong red light on it. So now
when you put some really thick red fog
in the room and then you shine a red
light on it, it's going to go completely
like opaque and it's going to be
incredibly red and it's going to look
terrible. What it's actually doing is
it's it's basically just drawing a large
uh sort of cuboid onto the screen and
then because it knows how far into the
scene the opaque objects are in that
scene, it can sort of it can work out
how much fog it would have to it would
have to put on here. but it has a few
problems. So, as a very simple example,
you can kind of tell in the shadows, it
tends to over brighten the shadows. It
sort of it flattens out the the effect
of the entire scene. And the other
problem we've actually got is if you add
more lights,
you can sort of see that the the scenery
lights up, but the fog itself is just
still this sort of like fixed yellow
color that I've that I've picked in
advance. Now, another issue that it had,
this is a transparent sphere. And so,
because it doesn't have any depth
information, it can't actually apply the
fog to this. So, the old fog system, um,
the on the CPU side, it just does a a
very simplistic approach to this. And it
it works out what how much fog the very
middle of the sphere would have and then
just sort of applies it over the entire
thing. So if I zoom in on it a bit and
then I lift it up, you can see that it
sort of stays fogged even as it pokes
out and then just as it crosses the
entire thing sort of leaves the fog. So
it that was mostly work roundable but um
you often have problems with um windows
on ships or anything with a large canopy
would suddenly it would s the the whole
canopy would then suddenly sort of pick
up the fog of the inside of the place.
So now we've got dynamic fog, dynamic
particles to go in the lighting. It's
incredibly cool. I've got a bit of a
reputation for liking the fog and
particles a little bit too much. It's
actually the the second thing I do as
soon as it goes into a level. You
automatically get depth. You get a
certain ambient and a mood via via the
fog. Um, and yeah, it's just incredibly
powerful. It kind of backs up uh all all
the hard work the lighting guys put into
into the levels.
That's intense. That's very intense. So,
with the new fog, you can obviously see
that the the lights are actually
affecting it. Um, we've got a spotlight
here going into it. What's quite nice is
that if you get down into the soup, you
can kind of
you can actually very clearly see that
there are these sort of
shafts of darkness
where the shadows properly affect the
fog.
So, this is um this is tech that we're
integrating from from Lumbiard at the
moment. to sort of it's still in
progress at the moment, but um if I
switch over to the debug modes, I can
sort of show how it's working. So, this
is just like a horizontal slice that
we've taken through the texture that we
use. So, what we've got here is um it's
kind of a it's a volutric texture that's
at the moment it's about a fifth of the
screen resolution and about 64 slices
deep. And so, the the samples are kind
of distributed towards the viewer end so
that you get more detail up at that end.
And just because because the camera sort
of widens your field of view widens in
the distance the same amount the same uh
number of divisions is sort of spread
over many more meters in the distance.
But as you can see this um this
rectangular volume has been sort of
inserted into um the volutric texture.
It doesn't bother inserting them here
because it knows uh it knows that
there's an opaque object. So it doesn't
really need to know what values it's got
there. So that's just a an optimization.
So that's just the density and the color
of the the volume that's been inserted
there. So then after that we have a
second pass that um it takes it takes
all the lights in the scene and again
this is just a a single thread of the of
a compute shader is run for every uh
every voxil of of this volume. So into a
second texture we take all the lights in
the scene. um we multiply them through
with the with the density and with the
opacity of the volume. Um and we
actually you you can't really tell here,
but it's it's working out depending on
your viewing angle, it's sort of saying
a light will sort of scatter towards the
camera more. So I think that you
probably can't see it, but the
highlights will change shape very
slightly. Maybe not. But also from here
you can see that um this this dark lump
here is casting a shadow from the main
light but it's then it's still receiving
kind of blue light from the sides. So
then the next pass after that we
actually we do a little bit of blurring
after this point. But um the next
interesting pass what this is is it's
actually it's a ray march that's been
done through the entire volume. So at
this point it's worked out that any
object that wants to be wants to have
fog applied to it now just has to it can
just read a single point in the texture
and it knows that that's exactly how
much fog something at that distance
would need. So up near the front you can
sort of start seeing the fog coming in.
But as you get deeper anything beyond
about this point is going to get exactly
the same fog drawn over it as about this
point because it's it's pretty much
opaque by that point. The great thing
about that is that whereas the old
transparency you had to just work out
for a single object on CPU how much fog
in general it would get, uh, this you
can now just any pixel that's being
drawn can just read this text to find
out how much how much fog it should
have. So it doesn't have any of the same
problems. Another quite nice thing
actually about this, if we go back to
the to this view. So this is now
evaluating a noise function and just
applying it onto the fog. So you can
sort of see the patchiness just sort of
slowly drifting around inside it. And uh
if I turn off the debug, you can now see
that there's a sort of there's slightly
more richness and there's slightly more
kind of complexity drifting around which
sort of lets you kind of work into the
scene a little bit more like sort of get
more interest, get more variation. In
order to switch over, we need to
basically pick a date where every old
fog volume in the game will break and
every new one will start working. And so
it's just a case of once we once we've
got the tech in and we're satisfied that
none of the parameters are going to
shift around um and you know suddenly
the density value won't mean twice as
much as it did yesterday or you know
whatever like that. At that point the
environment teams and the ship teams
have to go through absolutely everything
that's got fog volumes on it and just
make sure that they all look good or
delete them if they don't or replace
them or whatever. check that the lights
shining onto it don't show anything that
was slightly dodgy about how the lights
were set up or all that kind of thing.
It basically replaces the old fog
technology completely. It looks better
in almost every conceivable way.
We've been integrating it from the most
recent Lumbiard release that we've got.
A lot of the work that I'm doing at the
moment is just sort of moving taking
that and integrating it with the with
the things that we've changed in our in
our copy of the engine. So minor things
like um exactly where you get shadows
from for the sun, we've changed that to
be slightly more efficient, but
obviously the new code is coming from a
system that hasn't done that. And so we
just have to go patch that up, find find
where those parameters are coming from,
find where that data is coming from,
make sure that it all feeds through in
the right way, sort of hunt down bugs
that are caused by by differences
between the two systems.
The fog, uh especially in space, is
going to make a huge difference. Um, the
UK graphics guys are looking into
creating a unified fog system so that
even in, you know, the asteroid belt
right now, they're kind of dull and and
plain looking. It's just a bunch of
rocks floating around. But in in space,
you have a ton of ice particles. You
have a ton of rock particles, you have
all these little dust particles floating
around, and that creates volume. Um, so
really one of the focuses going forward
is making those spaces feel more alive
and and like there's matter there. um
like there's stuff that you're passing
through as you're flying through the the
asteroid belt. Uh and that's that's
driven by the fog system. So that fog
system is going to be be massive. But
having that in the engine is is
incredibly cool. Um you can create a
sense of depth just with fog alone. And
then as soon as you you introduce lights
dynamically reacting to that fog, which
is what an artist would spend a long
time trying to recreate, it's an
incredibly powerful tool to have to be
able to guide players like we kind of
touched on before. Uh and to create a
sense of depth away from the camera,
sometimes the things that you don't see
in the world and your your mind makes up
what that is is is far more powerful
than actually seeing that asset. So so
strong silhouettes and things like that
is is a very kind of distinct and cool
style in my opinion. The fork was only
uh different for so if by default the
fork going to come like really intense.
So it's depends on what kind of thing
you are working for. I can show this is
the default sense. So they just come as
a volume but you going to active the fog
scattering with the light. So depends on
the situation of each sin we have to
design like where the fog is come from
or what may possibly cause the fog and
usually the fog effect shows up on the
like brightest point. See we have a hot
spot around the ground and we got the
window the lighting traveling through
here. So in my way how I design the fox
scattering is like alongside the
direction of the uh possible lighting
source comes from. See here's the
window. So that's why those fork kind of
falling in that way. So this is actual
lighting source. And again um if I turn
it on this is everything life. So the
entire sense uh lighting wise it's
consisted with basic image shift light
fixture and the real lighting hotel
space and the fog effect.
It's brand new. It's only come in this
week and we're we're at the stages now
of scaling it up. So we we it's going to
work in an environment like this. Uh,
great reference. Thanks, guys. But we've
got uh we obviously need to make that
work on the scale of a nebula, which is
is is bigger than a, you know, a solar
system.
I am I'm very excited about the lit fog.
It's something I've played with for for
a few years, and it constantly amazes me
with how how much it improves the
atmosphere of of an area. Um, it just
makes things just the air feel thicker,
and you can really feel like you're
you're in this space. Like every single
day I basically grab a new build and
there's always some kind of new thing
that's just like a new value that I can
tweak that just makes things look a
little bit cooler. And it's it's really
exciting being able to see that kind of
stuff.
Wow.
Heat.
Heat.

Uh, I bet the crew had a lot of fun
covering Nate and all that fog.
Uh, does that count as research and
development?
I'm sure it does. And I'm going to say
yes. Then, uh, before we go, I just want
to remind subscribers that this month's
issue of Jump Point will be available
tomorrow. Subscribers can also fly the
Drake Buccaneer as part of the ship of
the month. And if you're interested in
learning about our subscriber program,
check out the link in the description.
That's all for this episode of ATV.
Happy Hour Friday returns tomorrow at
noon Pacific. The talented Josh Herman
will create another creature live on
Twitch, so be sure to check that out.
Super cool. Let's see if he can top the
flying spider. And I also want to thank
all the subscribers out there. You're
the reason why we can make shows like
this one and happy hour. Of course, Star
Citizen wouldn't exist without our
backers. So, big thanks to all of you.
Yes. And thanks for watching. We will
see you
around the verse.
[Music]
Everything I change blows up the game,
so that's fine.
Are you all right?
Could have had it could have doubled
with it being a bit longer.
It's pretty intense. Yeah,
that's pretty awesome.
It has got a funny smell to it though.
It's quite It's not bad. This is when
the fire alarms go off. It's going to be
hilarious if it does go off.
Thank you for watching. So, if you want
to keep up with the latest and greatest
in Star Citizen and Squadron 42's
development, please follow us on our
social media channels. See you soon.
