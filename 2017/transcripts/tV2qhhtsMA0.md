hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development i'm sandi
gardiner and i'm chris roberts it's
great to have you back Chris thanks
after attending games gone I spent a few
weeks at foundry 42 working with both
the UK and the Frankfort teams on a
variety of things including alpha 3.0
which we're making some great progress
on that's right our battle against 3.0 s
bugs and blockers continues and the team
is hard at work on multiple fronts to
get these issues knocked out as fast as
possible currently the dev team has been
focused on clearing out the remaining
blockers while our dev ops team is going
through the process of repairing the
build for distribution let's take a look
at all the hard work that's gone into
getting 3.0 ready with this week's burn
down hello and welcome back to burn down
our weekly show dedicated to reviewing
progress on issues blocking the release
of star citizen alpha 3.0 to the evocati
last week we ended at 26 total must fix
issues which was prioritized as 11
blockers 10 criticals and 5 highs let's
catch up with the team on how we're
progressing as we approach release
Aaron is very keen to try and go to a
party this week so what we've done is
severely cut down the PTM us fix list
those 21 issues are the ones that we're
going to focus on the main focus for
this like initial push to evocati is
going to be the experience of the first
hour two hours or so the the directors
and the executive took a really good
look at what we wanted to do for our
first release of a car to be because
we're really keen on getting this out to
to the evocati group and start for them
to start testing things Jerry's probably
Jerry shouldn't use right and labeled
right and the time when I should be a
chair so what I want is a very quick
top-level view from the user of their
group calling out like what kind of
issues that the thing that I asked QA to
do today in the Leeds meeting is I
wanted them to just highlight the ones
that they think are big evocati issues
that aren't on this list and send that
filter to you will recommend what we
think out of the 13 issues that they've
highlighted we think probably should be
fixed I think there's one or two that we
think you know it's probably worthwhile
but Aaron it's for you to make that call
and that you can let us know if you want
to add them or not just simply guys look
and only 20 bees will nourish needs of
silver once you guys feel to be guess
you take off good suppose like a stop
but I do think if you get the fixing
forum fully for the ATT market
please just be careful each other yes
don't just safety us and also just take
care make sure you get a check and so
for things because that costs us more
time anything when the basic build race
kills you hear it kills morning and then
what for
at least before that's a fine thing fix
it might sound in my Dave don't go back
sir
we just need to make sure that were
really careful when doing that stuff in
that rather an extra hour
make sure that's fixed and then China
returns the next
/ today there was an issue where you
spawn in in Levski and you can't get out
of your easy hub room the door just does
not open at all
so we've knocked that one its head today
this bug was this one here where the
doors in the habitation pods in Levski
weren't opening once the player spawns
our animations and our assets are stored
in separate places on perforce and we
also have something called an inclusion
list which is this guy here and this
inclusion list has everything that's
included 43.0 in it it just ensures that
we don't include stuff this shouldn't
win 3-0 the animations which are these
guys here weren't on that inclusion list
and it was a case of three clicks for me
to fix which is my kind of bug we found
these bug recently a few days ago where
QA noticed that when we were trying to
use the air traffic controller to land
or take off in a specific station and
you were not giving any landing pad
assigned or your ship was not a spawned
like nothing was really working as
intended and so the main problem we had
was that it was only happening on
release builds testing locally on
development builds from my computer or
QA on profile builds this was fine we're
checking it on the development build and
it's easy it's a debug a lot of stuff
because you can use a lot of Shiva's and
just to get more information about the
server about the client and what this
particular issue was only present on
release builds and so it's a lot harder
to debug that information which men call
us how to whitelist deceive us so we
could use it I discover after going
through the the logs was that one of the
operators which is trying to answer you
when you request a landing or takeoff
was getting into a valid state and that
was causing all the requests to go
through the to the operator to just fail
so he thought he could communicate with
you but he couldn't we came in this
morning
and notice straight away we had a little
bit
problem in that the bill we were wanting
to use for the day had a pretty severe
crash in in a something we call data
core which is kind of as the name
implies where a lot of data is stored in
the build relies upon so that meant that
as soon as we booted the game you had
about an eighty percent chance of
getting a crash with that there wasn't
work around for this but it didn't work
for everybody so we we really had to
make sure we fix that one up in shipping
only release builds nothing seems to
work
none of the network messaging is coming
in from the server you'll try to
interact with the door nothing will
happen you open your mobiie glass and
nothing will happen just nothing at all
and eventually you get disconnected from
the server it turned out it wasn't quite
as straightforward as we would have
liked there was a few other edge cases
we need to make sure that were they were
working properly and you know all all
the fixes worked through all the edge
cases we eventually got there but it did
slow down development a little bit
another bug fixing which meant that
certain people that couldn't use the
workaround how to roll back to the build
from the day before because of this
server crash which we're still in the
process of nailing down and should be a
fixing for that as soon as possible
once we've got a list of ships that we
can check that are safe that aren't
crushing the server then we can look at
the ATC issue and and we'll just do that
by spawning the same safe ships what
that turned out to be was that when the
player teleported a part of his his body
and his attachments is loadout what kind
of store attached to the seat so when
the ship got D spawned everything else
we get this bond that was attached to it
including a low down so your character
was fine on your local machine and on
the Sailor because it was a bit of code
that managed to detach your loadout from
the sea but it wasn't triggering
correctly on remote clients so I kind of
investigated that bit and found out that
it wasn't the network code that was
responsible we needed that little bit
that was going to detach
and the load out from the seat so once I
found out most pass it on to m1 or guys
in LA when we have to replicate that
across all the machines and on other
clients what was happening is we would
delete the ship and the teleportation
call wouldn't get sent over to the
client so we would end up deleting the
player and the reason for that is if we
pretend this cup here is the player and
I'm the spaceship this cups parent is me
so I for all intense purposes own this
Cup if I get deleted or removed from the
server
so does this cup the only way to prevent
the cup from getting deleted when I get
deleted is to change the pairing so we
need to make sure that that
teleportation call gets sent all the way
across all the clients so that this guy
could teleport to the proper spot away
from the vehicle and now when me the
vehicle gets removed it's gone and
pretty much that change was to make sure
that we send this thing called a remote
method so when we do the teleportation
on the server it sends out a broadcast
using a remote method to say hey
teleport this guy and remove them from
the seat and send them over there then
we'll get the delete message the ship
will go away the guys over there and
well everything's fine and dandy
the Vokes can be quite simple sometimes
you know exactly what the cause is just
as soon as you see the book it's just a
question of tracking it down fixing it
and others are a bit more complicated
it's kind of like layers of an onion
you've gotta peel away each layer and
that use involves passed it on to the
next person in the chain they peel away
their layer eventually get down to the
meat of the issue the the center of the
onion and actually fix the book
my team is responsible for digital
publishing and with 3.0 imminent we've
been doing a lot of work to enhance our
systems and expand our capabilities and
so I feel like we're ready to publish
pretty much any time we get a selected
build that's ready to go people know it
comes with a lot of changes we just
finished with amazing deployment for the
time service and the shop service most
probably by the end of today I'll
receive that the configuration for the
new probability service that also needed
as part of 3.0 from Jason Healy and Tony
Zurich with the introduction of any new
service we always have to be ready for
for all kind of quirks that available
usually when he runs that the service
and his machine to make sure it runs as
expected he does not put on
consideration how it would interact in a
full release deployment we used to take
way longer to receive specs and
contracts from the universe services
team and introduced it in the pipeline
but with good use of macros and good use
of certain batteries now we will be able
to introduce a new service pretty easy
than it used to be however that doesn't
mean that introducing a new service is
not a lot of work we still have to
monitor it closely to see what kind of
resources it would obtain what kind of
work look you can put it through and
once we get the crashes that the QA team
is easily able to reproduce fixed the
number of people that we have in the
evocati and just the amount of strange
and interesting ways that they can think
of playing the game that we might not
have thought of internally allows them
to generate
stability data that we might not know
about provided that we get the build
stable enough before we get it to them
and since we value their time we want to
make sure that the data that they're
generating for us is actionable things
that we can quantify and document and
then get fixed before we release another
build to them and our site as well
whenever we have a large release like
3.0 we always like to make sure that we
have enough room to add capacity no
matter how many players we can get we
are expecting a lot of players this
release especially with the new patch
our launcher the diff that should allow
a lot of players and so many areas in
the world to
be able to match as often as you want
was very little download sizes so we
kind of took the initiative and I
started playing with more regions than
DWS to allow us to expand originally I
came up with the stability score because
I think in arena commander 1.3 the
players were being really vocal about
the fact that the game servers were just
not stable and not fun because it was
crashing so often and just because of
the kind of person I am I like to help
people I saw an opportunity for
something that I could do that nobody
else was doing so over time the goal is
to reduce the threshold for what we
consider a failure I actually based the
stability threshold for what we consider
a failure on the feedback that we got
from our players in 1/3 oh and so
anything that's considered better than
that patch is considered a stability
pass as time goes on I'm planning to
steadily reduce the threshold for what
we consider to be a passing grade so
we'll have less crashes per person
online per hour compared to what we have
now because in order for people to get
into some other really specialized parts
of the game you'll have some people that
may want to only do data running some
people that may only want to do cargo
some people that may only want to do fps
and the problem with keeping things
where they're at now is that those
people are only going to encounter
stability issues that have to do with
the specific part of the games they like
to play since we've honed in our focus
on fixing major issues that impact
traversal and navigation of our vast new
universe we've made substantial progress
on knocking out our remaining must fix
issues for initial PT release to the
avocado test group a spokes complete
there must fix issues for initial
release they move on to continuing to
polish and bug fix more features that
will be included in our next publish to
PTU now at the time of filming this
we've reduced our total must fix issues
by 19 this brings us down to seven
issues stopping this first release to
the avocado group so tune in next time
to continue getting an in-depth look at
the road to the star citizen alpha 3.0
release here on burned-down
be sure to check back next week to see
how much closer we are to getting 3.0
into the hands of the evocati
now let's turn our attention today's
main feature the air traffic controller
system so we knew early on that it was
vital to build a system that could
manage traffic at landing zones and
space stations to help juggle both the
players that we'll be taking off and
landing but also the NPCs that will be
coming through not only will the air
traffic controller system help keep
landing pads organized but the designers
worked hard to keep the process as
immersive as possible so let's take a
look at what went into crafting this
vital system and see how it will help
keep you from landing a star fare on a
landing pad that's way too small
with the air traffic controller we have
tried to get a feeling of realistic
situation so when in real life when you
have different planes coming to an
airport do you need some kind of control
you need rules you need a way of making
sure everything is going to plan so we
have been trying to to get the same
behavior in star citizen so up to now
when you approach an a station
you just have to land and that was it
now you have to request landing which
implies a communication with someone and
MBC which can be a real NPC or a
automatic voice one telling you where
you can land or if there's no space
available or anything like that and
that's also a control over how much you
can stay in a landing pad like security
measures and so on right now players can
just land everywhere I want it's nothing
controlling them there's nothing saying
oh you should park here there's no
there's no rules to that and we needed
to find a system that basically
coordinates landing taking off and also
creating more immersion on what actually
like flight controls are the concept
behind our game is to be very realistic
in what we do so we do a lot of research
and anything that goes on and especially
that definitely does not leave out the
air traffic controller so we've done a
lot of research into what air traffic
controllers do when when we were on set
when filming and pcap it you know it was
it was really important you know because
the game was really very much filmed
like a movie and so as we as we went
about tracking and trying to maintain
and manage the content it was very clear
that we needed to focus on the
implementation side and use that as a
way to track how the the pcap should be
cut up in the way should be organized
and so utilizing that that background of
implementation I made sure that we
tracked our pcap in a way that was
ultimately feasible to edit edit the
project and and and and actually track
how how it was being cut up and on the
on the editing board it's really a
behavioral thing
and so while we can record all the
context and all the different dialogue
that we want it really becomes you know
really comes down to our systems to
really be able to handle it and yeah our
engineering team is just phenomenal they
are really pushing the boundary of what
AI can really handle and and making it a
real systemic module of behavior so that
it's not just like you know oh these
guys do this thing or whatever it's it's
a real air traffic controller module
that that that's that's defining all
these behaviors and and and it's not
even just one voice it's defining the
whole ballet of all the different you
know people doing all the signals in
there you know at AI saying oh they can
go you have to take off or you can land
and you go here you know all those kind
of things that's it's it's it's a whole
ballet if all these characters involved
well one of the more complicated things
is that it's not working like in in real
life where everyone behaves us they
should be right there's still a game and
players do what they want sometimes so
we need to make sure to have rules in
place which allow players to actually
have an immersive experience but also
don't abuse other players as well and
have like punishment almost when they
not follow the rules we have to account
for the necessarily stupid things like
the player strafing the station or
flying too close and you know they have
to react in the way it's you know that
is both helpful to the play good to know
let's not do that but but it's also it's
it's it's a game you know it happens and
it's it's fun it's entertaining so every
flight controller is its own AI when you
hailing a tower to request landing or
takeoff you're gonna be in contact with
an actual sub sumption driven AI which
has depending on the station unique
voice lines or generic one and you will
talk specifically only to that AI and
that will give their response so there's
an air traffic controller entity which
is a combined version of the seats we
already have and the usable system of
the designers are working on and then
they I will sit down and basically have
sensors or feelers you could say to
check how many ships are in the radius
what ships request landing what pads are
free what are occupied what are the
different stations of occupation of
these pads and will then according to
that address landing pads to players
there's a couple of peaceful ones for
special stations like left ski or grim
Hanks or Prada Lhasa and there's also
like a generic one a generic computer
system which also picks up if there's
for whatever reason no flight operator
available because our flight a brace
actually like physically placed in the
station so you could basically stand in
the station see him talking to someone
and whoever is on the ship would see the
same thing so it's a one-to-one
transition let's say that station gets
attacked or that guy is out of an
emergency or whatever is not there we
have a backup system that picks up which
is a generic computer voice and that
will handle the flight operation them if
you think about it we have a big amount
of content to get you know and be like a
big piece of cake you know the sponge is
the primary the big part of what what we
do but there's also cake needs some
icing needs some flavor and so we like
to you know have a general kind of voice
set that that is used across the the
galaxy and we also like to have some
nice specific characters that are placed
in locations and give a good flavor to
certain things like for instance let's
key we have it we have a general ATC but
we also have this flight ops dude in
unless key that's kind of like a
California dude like me and he's a great
character and he provides a lot of good
character to that to that landing space
and it's it's it's fun for players to
enjoy that specific you know character
set rather than having a just a big
universe of always general you know
characters running around so this a
little bit more complicated on just
triggering a voice and you need
animations for an NPC because if you go
to a specific place in the station you
will see this NPC talking to someone
maybe it's not you but he's talking to
someone and you can see how he's
communicating with other
people we need to make sure this is
synchronized in the network with
everyone we need to make sure if
different players are talking to the ADC
ATC's air traffic controller you need to
make sure that two people don't get the
same landing area you need to make sure
they are not told at the same time by
the same pc because as real people they
can only talk to one person at a time so
there are several synchronization and
network issues we have to consider while
working on this we have had some
challenges regarding for example the how
do you control items our current system
usually has like a priority system to
control which NBC is in charge of a
specific item so you can have for
example in a ship wanna me see
controlling the weapons while another
NPC is controlling the ship but if the
NPC controlling the weapons leaves the
pilot takes control over the weapons
things like that because of this system
it was not easy to get the air traffic
controller controlled by several NPCs at
the same time without having one
priority over the others so we have had
to do different systems in code so one
single ADC can be controlled by several
operators at the same time since we're
using the one-to-one transition like a
live feed to that ai you're talking to
you which was playing the animations
that means only one a I can technically
talk to one player at the same time so
the particular challenge there was to
get multiple ai's work together as a
traffic control and true you could say
and handle multiple requests at the same
time and not get overlapped or like take
requests of each other or portably
interests the same player so that was a
challenge we tackled with some ssin and
the group activity behaviors we have to
get them all working together in a nice
slave fashion the typical air traffic
controller is very much or at least for
our system it's it's like an answering
machine where you you know you uh you
call up a company and you like okay now
they gave me through getting a landing
pad and what to do and then they they
they they tell you how to okay you know
okay we need money you know pay
pay for this landing okay well you don't
have enough credits you know but it's
it's it's the answering service that
that kind of takes takes that when we
designed the system we looked at two
things mainly one was like real life air
traffic control at the airport or at
military vessels like an aircraft
carrier and the other thing was there's
also a lot of flight simulations out
there were like it's not really an MMO
but you have actual people sitting in a
tower and directing other people to land
and take off and give like a landing but
landing pads technically but yeah it
gives more lifes to the station right it
is some more people you talk to in the
station and they actually have feedback
for you and it's not always gonna be the
same hopefully we have for like
different variants for that the player
has more interactions with the world
itself instead of just having the ball
giving everything to the player yeah I
mean the air traffic controllers just
it's just a great subset of what what we
do here at cloud Imperium because it's
it's just it's just the one many facet
of all the different systems that we do
and how we put you know everything into
something so that's just a great example
so another fun aspect of the air traffic
controller system is that the person
answering your landing request can also
provide a little flavor to them at that
location we've already done this with
Eze lahmacun who's the atc at Levski his
laid-back attitude is fitting for a
place like Levski but will stand in
contrast a more professional or more
automated controllers located elsewhere
