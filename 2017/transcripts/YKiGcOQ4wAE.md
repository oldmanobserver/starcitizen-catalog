hey hey no after you after you
ayuh know what welcome to bug smashers
we have a new episode today just right
right no we actually don't need him and
don't you know I'm done I got a helmet
light that we're gonna try to fix me you
don't wanna see that helmet light sorry
if it's too busy with other bugs
apparently just smash them too many bugs
so I'm gonna try to smash one or at
least try this match winner
try mark is so swarmed with bugs that I
am going to try to help troubleshoot
some bugs for him but I'm gonna take
more of an artist approach at it so it
should be terrifying and interesting so
I'm gonna go ahead and open up a build
right now and what should be happening
is the characters should have a light
inside of the helmet illuminating their
face but I heard that that's problematic
at the moment so let's see exactly
what's going on let me jump in the game
and now I'm going to load a character
let's try player1 armor and let's switch
the lighting so we can kind of see it up
already that looks to be a problem we
have a light spawning at zero zero zero
and let's take a look at the character
Oh yep that's definitely a bug
so it looks like we have a light that's
supposed to be spawning on the
characters helmet but it is missing the
bone attachment and is going straight to
the root of the character at 0-0 in
addition it's also spawning a zero zero
so since it's an entity I'm going to go
ahead and open up data Forge and take a
look exactly what the item is doing and
how it's calling the light all right
looks like we got data Forge open so
let's take a look at this item so I'm
going to go ahead and navigate to the
helmet item entities SC item characters
human armor light helmet light helmet
and this character is the Explorer so
let's go ahead and open up the
components and let's see what we find
and there we have an effects that's
depreciated by opening this effects pram
we have a light that's enable so it
looks like we are switching over to a
new system we were going from the
effects system to the entity effects
system which I imagine the entity
effects system has more options it plays
better with the other disciplines and
the other items in in the scenes so
probably has a lot of good gameplay
options as a result to this new system
so I'm going to go ahead and delete the
old system that's labeled depreciated
and let's see if that's what's causing
the bug
let's go ahead and save the change
alright now let's jump into the game and
see if our changes took effect and it
fixed our bug
let's go ahead get the lighting a little
darker so we can see what we got and I
am no longer seeing a light spawning at
zerozero and I'm no longer seeing a
light spawning at world zero zero so
looks like this has been resolved now
I'd imagine that they don't just want
the light to be spawning at zero zero
and they don't want the light to be
spawning at 0 zero in the world they
want the light on the players face on
the players helmet so let's go ahead and
go back into data Forge
and let's see if we can actually get a
light to properly spawn all right now
let's go ahead and take a look at the
entity and let's see what options we
have for this new entity effects
component so I'm gonna go ahead and open
this up and there we go there's a light
entity effects and it looks like we can
add a new tag and now we have an old
bone so I think the best way to approach
this is to actually have a slot
attachment that is directly tied to a
joint location on the helmet luckily
we're already prepared for this so what
we've done is we've created a bone rig
that actually shows up on the character
loads and runtime and then we can attach
the light so we've created this little
rig here we have a floodlight on the
side of the head we have a floodlight on
the front top and we have a light coming
from the bottom which will be our
primary direct light then we have two
little side lights that we can use is
like paneling or whatnot
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and see if
we can get these things actually working
in the game
alright so under the entity slot
attachment let's go ahead and select a
character bone attachment and under the
character bone attachment let's go ahead
and paste one in so looking at the
diagram here
I think a great place to start is this
primary light right here which is bottom
light Oh for so attachment Oh for is
what we named the bone all right so
let's go ahead and just drop in a
temperature we've got a diffuse
multiplier let's go ahead and give it a
name I'm gonna name it the same as this
file so bottom light Beaufort
cool cool let's go ahead and enable
let's go ahead and save
now the beauty of having the actual bone
attachment means we've already somewhat
rotated the the bone position and
already have done the translation for
the position which means that we should
just be able to spawn it it'll pop up
approximately exactly what we already
wanted so the editing will be very
minimal if any at all all right so let's
go ahead and jump in and see if we can
see a light
and I see something that's a good sign
hey check that out we got a helmet lied
so what's happening right now is the
light is actually a point light which
means that it's projecting in six
directions which means that we're gonna
have to give it a directional so let's
do try to texture projection so it only
shoots one direction and then it will
have it kind of this ghostly coming up
from the bottom right there so let me
jump out a game all right
let's jump back into dataforge and I'm
gonna change the point light to a
projector light open that up and now we
have a texture Pass so I'm going to use
a mask to have a bit more control over
the direction that it's going
so let's just do a general spots we
probably don't need a four meter radius
so let's go ahead and turn that way down
to point two let's give it a nice little
viewing frustum so let's crank this up a
little bit it's gonna look 120 140 we'll
leave the light default for now and
let's turn down the multiplier quite a
bit so let's go I don't know
point one
let's go ahead and turn on a shadow
Kassar and let's give this a try
all right so let's jump back into game
and let's see if our texture projection
is working
get them that nighttime lighting load up
her character and it looks like I'm not
seeing the bright light anymore
rotate around hey hey look at that
we have a light now coming from the chin
alright so the next thing I'm going to
do is I'm going to turn on this two side
lights as we see in our example we got
bottom light oh five and bottom light oh
six which will kind of be nice I'll do
like kind of a subtle splash I'm not
gonna enable shadows I think that the
budget probably only permits for one
shadow caster then maybe we could turn
on a nice floodlight so let's take a
look at this jump over here go ahead and
jump out a game
and
we have a total of six lights so I'm
going to go ahead add six we don't have
to use them all but might as well set up
the item in case the artist wants to
and I'm gonna go ahead and add all of
the ensure that they're all projectors
and ensure that they're all bone
attachments and then one by one I'm
gonna go ahead and
add the mod of the same
all right now that we got them all set
up let's go ahead and save and see if it
worked
all right we're back in the editor we
have our six light entity set up in data
Forge and let's see if they can be
enabled now jump into game
let's get that nice nighttime lighting
that we like
all right nothing weird happening rotate
around and it looks like all of our
lights are indeed working it looks a
little weird right now but that's just
because we need to polish them and if I
jump over here and get back into
dataforge let's get a little crazy
let's see if this will actually update
in real time look at that that is
awesome
all right so I got an idea since it
updates in real time we can now actually
go on to the lighting polish path we've
got them all on we got on while working
but it looks super funky it looks super
weird so now let's actually give the
lights and proper settings and dial
everything in and then close out this
bug all right so it looks like someone's
picking me up I'm gonna go ahead and run
towards it and maybe have this person
take me to space so I get a nice dark
environment to finish up the helmet
lights all right now that I'm in let's
go ahead and uh who's that a mystery
pilot can we can we take off please
and while we're taking off I'm gonna go
ahead and work on this helmet lighting
alright let's go ahead and
jump over and there's our lighting
freaking out it's going to recalibrate
this there we go okay cool so I'm gonna
go ahead and jump over to dataforge and
I think what we would like to do go
ahead and reinitialize that all right so
let's start with the bottom light that
seems to be kind of the most important
there we go
it looks kind of cool let's go ahead and
put a little bit or radius on there
too bad
see if we can do a little bit of
rotation
cool cool all right now let's go ahead
and turn on some of those fill lights
let's try the bottom left
right
the song
on
let's turn those weighed we just want
this so
all right cool let's go ahead and turn
on that primary flood
all right so we've got the side it's go
ahead and once again turn that way down
cool
go ahead and do this
very nice now I think that this is a
little too close so I'm gonna go ahead
and back this up here
[Music]
just kind of splash across the face a
little bit
very nice
cool and let's go ahead and turn this
down and we got ourselves some helmet
lighting it's not the best but you know
it's something all right so is that it
over this seat there
I think we got ourselves a marky-mark
one day I'll get a light oh I'm sorry
bud
no lights for you so we had a little fun
helmet light bug there and for us
how'd it go oh good we I believe we
smashed the bug as you would say so the
light was spotting at zero zero on the
characters route probably because it
wasn't finding the bone attachment and
drawing straight down and then it was
also spawning at zero zero in the world
so we went into dataforge and we found a
depreciated effect system removed that
right out lights were gone everything
working good and then we added our new
entity effect system new and revised and
awesome so we added some lights through
that system and attach them to the
helpers for the helmet and now the
character headlights we jumped into the
quiet tested them off with a black tee
player but I didn't have lights but
that's another story
that was intentional well I hope you
