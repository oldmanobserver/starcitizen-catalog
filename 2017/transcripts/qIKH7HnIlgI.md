Mark Abent: Hey everyone, welcome to Bugsmashers.
I’m your host Mark Abent, I’m a Gameplay
Programmer here at CIG, Los Angeles and I’m
here to show you some bugs that we smashed
and let’s take a look.
So, this bug is when you’re having fun playing
Arena…
I’m sorry, Star Marine and you’re having
a fun time shooting and all of the sudden
your game pauses or if you die and you revive
your game pauses.
So what’s happening...well, we have our
character here and as you can see what we
have is we have this body and then we have
his face and then his hands and those hands
and face… they’re called skins.
So we have a skeleton which is his body and
then we have skins and a face which are still
the same thing.
They get attached to his skeleton and they
become embedded and those extra, extra bits
of geometry that get tangled into making what
he is and his skeleton is preloaded and it
stays in memory til it’s no longer needed
and then it will eventually unload.
His skins on the other hand, they’re constantly
loaded and unloaded every time you revive
or respawn as a character and that’s what’s
causing these big performance drops because
we have to unload it and then reload it, unload
it then reload it, rather than keeping it
there in memory.
So what we’ve done is added a resource caching
for skins just like all our other geometry.
So that we don’t have get this stall, so
let’s see what that stall looks like.
So if I kill this guy and I revive on this
guy… oh, I can no longer move the mouse
because he’s stalling loading the other
guy and you can see it can be quite severe
on some machines and other instances it can
be a few milliseconds… on this guy it’s
a full couple seconds.
So, let’s go into the code and we have this
thing called a global resource skin is what
we made to preload skins and what we want
to do is enable it.
So… what this does is any time that there’s
a skin resource either through DataForge or
through XMLs, it will load this particular
thing in which we’ll know it’s a skin
resource and on unload it’ll load our skin
once and any time we use it we’ll add one
of these rough counts and the idea is when
we die we have our ragdoll which will bump
the rough count up.
We revive, we have the player which bumps
the rough count up to one and then the ragdoll
goes away which releases one of the counts
and we still have one count so we don’t
have a stall and eventually when the player
and the ragdoll go away because... well, the
player left and there’s no one using his
face or his head it removes the resource cause
it’s not needed anymore.
So, let’s recode and see what happens.
All right, so back into the game and we’ll
kill this guy and as we take time to respawn…
funny enough before we were doing this fix,
we actually stuck in a bunch of the heads
in the level as a temporary fix so all the
heads would be loaded so it wouldn’t cause
any stalls til the code was ready.
Once code was ready we removed the heads and
now we have a proper code fix.
So we respawn and as you can see I’m able
to move around just fine, there’s slight
delay but not as bad as it was before cause
we’re actually keep the head in memory or
skins in memory until we’re not needed anymore.
So, we die and respawn, die and respawn, it
won’t have to load them cause they’re
already there in memory.
Well, hope you guys enjoyed.
So as you guys saw we had a little fun bug
where if your player dies and he revives,
he’ll completely stall for a few seconds
depending on your machine could be like nothing
or if you have a slow hard drive it could
takes seconds in which really gets frustrating
cause you want to get back into the battle,
kicking ass or just dying again.
So, what happened is… well, we have a way
to precache a bunch of geometry and things
like the player’s body or skeleton, that
gets preloaded and it stays around so if he
dies and revives, it’s there so it just
makes a copy, but his hands and face, they
don’t so when you die and revive it has
to reload them again which causes the stall.
So all it was is we had to add a little bit
of preloading so those skins stay intact so
when we die and revive it knows just to plop
them back there and not load a big resource
hogging thing.
Well, hope you guys enjoyed, til next time.
