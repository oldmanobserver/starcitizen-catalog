everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host mark abent I'm a senior
gameplay programmer here at CSULA and
I'm here to show you the bugs so hi
everyone we're here and our fancy-dancy
vanduul swarm and we're going to
replicate this crash where if we enter
spectate mode see if I enter it there
I'm in spectator mode everything works
as expected everything's moving around
but as soon as I disconnect I should
crush do-do-do-do BAM crash this was an
interesting crash it's actually HUD code
accessing the item court system the an
important system of course is our system
which we use to connect like weapons to
the player player to the ship all sorts
of crazy shenanigans and for some reason
the parent I should say it's the parent
port parent port or this particular port
is garbage it might be this it either
way it doesn't like something there's
some nasty it's parent part that's
actually garbage and when access it when
it was like whoa you're actually seeing
memory that was deleted so what's
happening in a why well let's step back
close all the games and we're gonna
really
run it and explain the issue so I ran
the wrong thing I click too fast come on
there you go all right so what's
happening here is anytime we sit into a
seat we have to switch the player to
this link-state it's in this actor link
state code right here and this is
basically the area that you hit when you
enter or where you get removed from a
seat you'll get the link event and the D
Link event and under normal situations
you should be going here so if you want
to go into a ship you should get the
link event so let's get processed if you
want to do something like inter
spectator mode leave the seat and go to
this bit of code what these bit of code
here is we basically take the player and
we don't attach them to exactly an item
part we just set his parent what that
allows us to do is have his radar
communicate to the vehicles radar and
have the vehicles radar communicate to
the players radar it's like this is how
they the to communicate to the items and
sub-items so the player can players
visor could see all the items on the
ship and vice versa and that's what
basically this bit of code does and this
bit of code the d-link will clean it all
up so that we completely separate and if
we don't get the proper D linking and
unlinking Arleen linking and unlinking
will never reach these bits of code and
so if we have the ship and we delete it
but the player never got the the link
event or we and then we switch to
observer mode this is gonna leave a
dangling pointer and the item port code
because we never cleaned up so when we
sit down we tell the player that you are
now linking to the vehicle we switched
to observer mode we moved the player
delete the vehicle well we never got
this D links thing so now the player
never cleaned up his item port so he's
still pointing to this memory that was
just gone
so we need to make sure that we get to
here before we go to observer mode and
the observer code is so if I request to
observe so we'll get it process it and
ultimately come here and what it's doing
is summary of the code when we delete
the ship it will exit him but before it
could actually get to the link state
it's just completely setting a state
machine to something completely else so
even if we remove them from the seat
he's this bit of code just ignores that
all stuff and just directly a sciences
new state machine and we never get to
dealing the fix of course is to make
sure that we properly exit the seat so
that the state machine could pretend the
required e-link we could remove all the
admin port pointers and then we're not
wanting to envelop memory and we're
actually out of the seat correctly and
then we can now see then snap to the
required spectate mode so we're gonna
hit recode do compile in place and as
that code goes up and running
bacon here that crunch go bacon
alright recoat is finished so now we can
connect to the server and of course
connect things then take a bit of time
so wonder what we can do I know
bacon
yes that's right you're just gonna watch
me eat bacon for the next minute I'm
okay with this bacon
all right we're back into the game put
the bacon aside and now we're gonna eggs
go to spectate mode and we properly eggs
to this sick seat we went to observer
mode so now everything should have
cleaned up correctly so when I exit I
should not crash from that particular
crash and as you can see I haven't
crashed it's now loading the main menu
all as well so you could go to spectate
mode exit the game come back get out of
the spectator mode going to seat do
whatever your heart's content and you'll
no longer crash because we have no more
dangling pointers hope you guys enjoyed
time for more bacon as you guys saw we
had a fun little bug there where you
join in and your co-op and you want to
enter spectate mode and all sudden
everything's fine and dandy you leave
the game and all the sudden BAM everyone
crashes spectator mode wasn't taking us
out of the seat correctly in fact it was
just kicking the vehicle away and then
moving us in the spectate while everyone
thought you're still in the seat so now
spectate mode will actually remove you
from the seat before moving you in to
spectate mode now no more crashes when
anyone leaves and all is good hope you
guys enjoyed until next time
