## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm Josh Sherman we've got a
good one for you today later in the show
we'll be talking to Tony zhirova
and others to learn more about the
improved mission system but set to bring
a whole bunch of new gameplay to the
persistent universe but before we tackle
that it's time for another edition of
burned down or we discuss all of this
week's progress on the alpha 3.0 release
let's check in with the team to see what
issues the devs have been battling
welcome back to burn down our weekly
show dedicated reviewing progress on
issues blocking the release of star
citizen alpha 3.0 last week we ended at
76 total must fix issues which was
prioritized as 10 blockers 50 criticals
14 hives 2 moderates and no trivial so
let's catch up with the team to see how
we're progressing : travel short trip
distance set too far taking ages to go
between moons or the destination that
should not have the slow version of the
quarter about 25 minutes ago aid a half
an hour ago Mike Dillon Spock common
tonight and the way of dealing with it
is for Mike to fix this issue being to
probably revert his change so the rich
recent bug we got for the quantum drive
had to do with traveling way too slow
within the system our star system is
massive and not largely the actual solar
system but it's like scaled towards that
and we recently wanted to have
short-range travel between very close
points so the points around a planet
unfortunately our calculations we didn't
take into account how fast we were going
so what we were calculating dynamically
for the short range had to do with how
fast do we get to travel speed and how
fast do we slow down one solution we put
in towards that was to also fixing
targeting issues we replaced the physics
push we were using where we pushed the
ship along its forward with a calculated
envelope of where you should be we could
pass in a time ago
five seconds in you should be here at
this speed that also allowed us to trim
our ramp up ramp down times working with
designs so that they knew that they
could modify that to shorten that angle
and it allows us to now travel slowly
around the planets but still get the
fast travels between the moon's
themselves what only takes like five or
six seconds maybe 10 depending on how
far away we're still working on tuning
those numbers so we have nice long fun
travel as you can get out walk around
the ships and stuff but it still doesn't
take a half an hour to go from one side
of a planet to another because that's
just not fun we had another issue kind
of let off of that where we ended up
going too fast because we over
accelerated in the other direction and
everything way too far so it's been a
matter of balancing out the code making
sure it's calculating things correctly
and working with design to get the
visual and the feel that they want and
then working with VFX to make things
look pretty as it's going and
everything's come along really well on
that so now it's working pretty well we
still got a few tweaks we want to do but
overall to work and really solid I would
define the agenda the week before you'd
be testing that agenda would be figuring
out the issues with that and would be
coming up with something that we could
look to review in the event that that
thing wasn't available right now what
we're going to suggest is commodity
inventory cargo that whole gameplay loop
of being able to sell as well and maybe
even looking at the kiosk and if that is
if that does have issues then there's
other things that we can look at in
terms of mission missions or even areas
of being able to traverse to different
planets there's a lot of different
things I've been marked off for complete
so the whole idea here is you know we
got a look at them so recently we were
regressing a bug on the PU for the 3.0
build I went to to drop a ship on to a
character on a pad just to see the
animations at first what ended up
happening is the ship exploded the ship
blows up and the flare is just standing
there like nothing happened
which so flies into him it pauses
because it's freaking out ship blows off
and then the guy is like no problem
there is another video ships like flying
into person and
blows up and the guy is just floating
there like didn't care nothing happened
QA we want to go bigger and better so I
spawned a star fair at that point I got
up to speed and sure enough start favor
exploded as well so this is obviously
kind of an issue and looking at what was
going on it ended up being a few
different issues like initially it
started with why the ship blowing up
which was there was some code added for
the gamescom demo because small ships
would like fly into the address and the
interest would just immediately blow up
so some code was added to like figure
out the mass difference between the
address and the ship or like the two
ships clicked colliding into each other
and it had the knock-on effect of
working incorrectly when you're flying a
person into the ship because there's
obviously this huge master between the
ship and the person and it worked
backwards because it wasn't intended to
work in this situation and it added like
huge amounts of damage to the ship and
destroyed the ship getting hit and
damage was being applied but he was
still standing there like nothing
happened and when you like ask the game
hey what's the health of the player it'd
be like zero and the players just still
standing there like walking around like
nothing's wrong so you need to actually
manually trigger a death which was
another step that had to be done so now
eventually a person in first-person view
and the ship like flares at you and a
bit of a pause but the player is killed
blood on the screen everything's good on
the ship hasn't blown off which is what
you want those are related to like the
waiters describing the bugs you pull on
one thread it actually trickles and like
solves a bunch of JIRA tickets like a
prospector not taking damage on the
engines
it's the UV to overlay tissue that I
keep trying to push up to a higher level
so I still need to talk to engineering
today during our our door sprint to say
these are two must-haves that I need to
accomplish three Oh
the rest is psyche nice ice kind of case
three-oh stuff but these are like my
must-haves stethoscope very well the
ships of the moment I said that there
things keep going differently wrong my
audio become when they're back in the
current imagine time switches or the UV
tube or maps and damages on about a
third and ships maybe courtship spear
just enough to have it set up at all so
another important three point of a
feature that we've been focusing
focusing on this time is the
disconnection recovery logic so what
this means is we're now able to track
graceful disconnects versus ungraceful
disconnects a graceful disconnection is
you know anytime you bring up you know
the main menu in the game and you
explicitly choose to log out
that's a graceful disconnect but in an
ungrateful disconnect could be any
situation where you lose connection to
your ISP or you know perhaps the client
crashed and you're trying to get back
into the game so if the backend detects
that an ungraceful disconnection
occurred then we save you know player
metadata as well as create some
reservation tokens you know for
individual game servers for your spot so
that you know when you log back in
you'll immediately be presented with a
pop-up dialog that says hey do you want
to reconnect to the game server that
you're less connected to and so if you
accept then you know the matchmaker will
immediately put you in that instance and
at that point you know the the network
objects between the server and the
client should out of a sync up and the
goal is to get you to spawn in exactly
the same location in the universe that
you were at the point of the
disconnection I want to get I want to go
to every cut the first thing I want to
make sure you do is traverse the system
easily while and that's all this set of
bones is about is we do you know from
getting in taking off a TC working QT
working we have to go to locations all
that kind of stuff we just get that
working and so it's not it's not a night
you know another than that Maps or time
trial bike jumps place to take off you
do that kind of stuff then we have what
I think actually
a really good start for Democrats it's a
lot of fun it's fun you got a fancy
piece of things and then once we get
this set of twenty you know six books
left don't forget these are the 26 books
I want fixed to go to a McCarthy with
but I'm sure what fits a bunch of other
stuff you know at the same time stuff
like that and then we basically go and
get that in and then once you get that
set but God speaks then one of one did
that have sit sit down again with Todd
and then say write what some what's the
next feature we want to focus on and
we'll pick another say 10 20 you know
feature that said let's get training
looking properly and there maybe 10 or
15 features and we said right this is
these are 17 books with that that's the
next release around Cathy let's get all
this stuff worked on another fix list of
the background just basic pick a feature
at time they look down just keep them
going that way that's how Lina closes at
so as we talked about last week we've
tightened the focus of our first test
plan for the evocati which will be
traversing and experience the expanse of
the new universe and all that entails
then while we're getting larger tests
support will continue to polish and bug
fix more features push them out for more
testing and so on and so forth until
release now at the time of filming this
we've reduced our total must fix issues
by 50 some by fixing bugs and some
shifted over to allow for a more focused
polish of traversal and like Erin said
this brings us to 26 issues stopping
this first release of the evocati group
so come back next week to continue
getting an in-depth look at the road to
star citizen alpha 3.0 release here on
burndown
remember we also published an updated
3.0 production schedule report every
week you can find it on our site to
explore further details about the status
of 3.0 let's now turn our attention to
the mission system with all the moons
and planets plan for star citizen it was
important to design a procedural mission
system that could provide plenty of
content yet we needed to do it in a way
that also incorporated handcrafted
missions and characters to make sure
that the universe feels alive the
blending of procedural and handcrafted
missions has been a goal of ours from
the very beginning and with the release
of 3.0 you will get to experience the
first implementation of the new system
let's check it out
most appealing aspect of star citizen to
me has always been the level of freedom
that it promised the idea that she'd be
able to wander through a massive and
extremely detailed universe and craft
your own unique path I'm fine with
limitations being imposed but they need
to be done within the context of the
game so that for example if a player
acts like a criminal
the game needs to have mechanics in
place security forces a bounty system
the concept of reputation and
understanding of ownership and things of
that sort so that the game can push back
is appropriate ultimately it all comes
down to choice and consequence that's
part of the real world and it ought to
be part of the game as well big
challenge of the game is it's such a
large universe and we got to fill it
with with interesting content and
interesting stuff to do and the work
that I'm doing on the mission system is
to try and create tools that the
designers can use to to generate
interesting content and also it sort of
reusable content as well rather than the
designers having to say English in this
mission you know there should be three
ships and two of them should be pirates
and one of them should be security what
they should be able to say is hey we
need like a stand off mission where
pirates and you EE are fighting each
other and the system can look up into
the universe and go well actually in
this part of the solar system it's a
really wealthy area so there might be a
lot of security ships so we'll spawn a
whole bunch of security ships and maybe
like one plucky pirate who kind of made
his way and was trying to make a break
for it alternatively it could be like ah
this is a really rough neighborhood it's
a really poverty-stricken area of the
universe it's a bit rough we'd won a
bunch of pirates or maybe one or two
pirates but with more pirate
reinforcements ready to jump in and join
them so at that point it becomes a much
more procedural living universe rather
than the designers specifically saying
hey every time you come to this
particular section of space you will
find two pirates fighting 1ue
so what we want to be able to do is to
say here's a ship you know it's got an
engine room it's got a bridge it's got a
mess hall and designers want to be able
to say right it's going to need two
pilots four security staff a handful of
engineers go and our system needs to be
able to identify where on the ship those
characters should spawn
also set them up with behaviors to run
subsumption allows complex systems to be
broken down into hierarchical components
that can be quickly and easily combined
to create logical and layered systemic
effects it does this via enforcing a lot
of structure so that the base elements
know how to properly interface with one
another and so that non programmers can
quickly construct large quantities of
content the the speed of implementation
is actually extremely important since
larger component dictionaries equate to
a greater ability for the system to
craft an appropriate response to a
particular set of inputs NPCs don't
start to truly look intelligent until
they can understand prioritize and
appropriately respond to a lot of
different stimuli and missions start to
very quickly feel boring and repetitive
if there's not enough variation so with
sub sumption these base components are
just the starting points many of them
can be algorithmically modified
customized on-the-fly so that the game
can more effectively respond to a given
situation
Tony's subsumption editor allows the
designers to specify those requirements
for a ship so they can say right cool
you know you need this many pilots with
these behaviors you need this many
janitors with this you know these
behaviors but picking sensible locations
to spawn these characters has been quite
a challenge I mean we did end up for a
while with characters spawning on top of
tables and you know stood on there on
the top of the spaceship and then over
time we've kind of refined it we've gone
well they're not really sensible places
for the characters to be so it's it's
been a an improvement you know a slow
process but we got there the thing that
substernal aoz us to do is I can just
find a location on three planets I can
find a outpost on one of those planets
out of tens of hundreds of outposts
however many we have and then I can find
a room and then I can spawn a box in
whichever one of those it's it's now
reached the point where designers have
moved away from flow graph entirely
which was a particularly important
milestone since they're now able to
start realizing some of those inherent
force multipliers we're now in the
process of
you know we're now in the process of
training designers how to most
effectively utilize the system this is
going to take some time since it
involves getting them to think about
some things differently than they have
in the past so it's a lot more a lot
more open we have a lot more kind of
opportunities to do missions that are
more expansive when we decided to go to
substantial we will approve a choice and
that was whether we'd go in
half-heartedly kind of thing we'd keep
the old missions there and support them
and keep them alive in flow graph and
just make the new missions in
subsumption or whether we just rip it up
and start again we can't have designers
and coders keeping two systems alive
because bugs appear all over the place
you know you can never just say this is
done and it will always stay done you
know you have to always support these
things so yeah we started again and that
gave us the opportunity to revisit all
those old missions and give them the
verse absorption touch which is like we
can never do the variety like a
randomization things like that in flow
graph it's just not possible
working with sub sumption is quite
similar to how we used to work with flow
graph it's still a visual scripting tool
and we still have to build missions with
objectives and logic to progress a
mission but substantial allows us to
build things in a more modular way and a
more reusable way so if we're building
say if we're going back to this mission
where we picking up a box on a planet
for instance in an outpost we would make
a little bit of logic that is reused for
any number of missions where it's
something like when you pick up a box
and it shows the objective where you
need to take it and then when you drop
the box the objective appears on the box
we only have to build this logic one
since absorption and then we use it
multiple times in many missions now that
seems like a really small little thing
but having to only be able to make that
once and then use it multiple times
across mission content actually means
that the experience is more consistent
and it also frees us up to do more
interesting things
one of the biggest challenges to getting
subsidiaries I was able to pretty
quickly get a good sense of how I wanted
the architecture to actually function
what I really needed though was a
counterpart on the game side someone
that had had dealt with a lot of the
same issues and spoke the same language
but that had a really really really
detailed knowledge of CryEngine and so
we lucked out we were able to pick up so
many talented people from Crytek in
early 2015 one of those in particular
was Francesco Riku Qi a lead AI engineer
with a ton of experience we've since
added a number of other people to the
effort and the end result has been that
things are now moving along in a pretty
solid pace on a number of different
fronts the last thing that I'd mentioned
in this area is that continues to be a
challenge to getting substantial out the
door or what I'd call the endpoint
systems these are the pieces of
technology upon which chunks of
subsumption logic often depend
pathfinding for example has been it's
been operational for probably a couple
of years but it's only been relatively
recently that a lot of the visual
glitches started to finally get
addressed such things they might sound
purely cosmetic
but abrupt turns hugging walls and
improper acceleration they quickly rip
you out of the game world and break that
sense of immersion that we're aiming to
get there have been a lot of other
animation issues particularly with
regard to usable that had to be solved
before characters could properly
interface to everything from chairs to
control panels to crates and so on
subsea is tightly integrated with our
object container system which means that
it had to reach a certain level of
maturity before we can move forward and
this is actually just the tip of the
iceberg there are many other systems
upon which subsumption depends that had
to reach a certain level of
functionality before the system could
really start to flicker to life that's
actually why getting substantial into
3.0 is such a big deal it means that a
lot of other critical game systems are
now starting to either come online or
have reached a certain level of
refinement which is why I expect game
play to start making considerably larger
leaps forward in the future than it has
in the past
one day I was just trying to get a
couple of guys you know the bag of two
guys and usually with the bag on-screen
so we have some functionality on the
game where you can look at a character
press the slash button on the num
keypads and then it will immediately
show on screen like what he's trying to
do what some behavior so it shows the
behavior let's say the activity which is
in the sub activity which you see in the
logic is running the variables that are
running and you know what we call the
personal log and the personal log is
similar to what we're talking about you
know about the story because the way I
tend to write behaviors is really to
tell the story of their decision flow so
you can read and say like oh I'm really
angry now I need to go to pick up
something and say oh I couldn't find
something then I'm gonna go buy
something else and you can see from this
story if something goes wrong because
you know which story you are trying to
tell and if something is odd then you
immediately spot but then like it was
impossible to the back two guys at the
same time because of the space and the
screen so we create the subsumption
visualizer that is the kinda
representation of subsumption in the
game in the engine and the beginning was
just debugging like you know activities
and then I had the help of table art
because he also wanted the bank the
missions with the decided design I was
saying okay then I will add the the
mission debugging and he started like
you know something that we we needed and
then people really started to like
because they oh now I can keep like
track of an infinite amount of log not
only the last five lines and I can see
things changing and then we started to
implement other functionality for
example Dave helped me implementing the
ability of changing variable values on
the fly so you can take a behavior that
there's a time where our five minutes
there's a you know how are you wanna
test it but I just want to make sure
that I'm not waiting five minutes for
the screen you can change the time or
value or you know you could reset some
of the values just to make sure that
ticks gets trigger again and then we
were talking with designers and of
course when we started to work on the
conversation their problem was I out but
I helped played the whole mission to
just trigger one conversation that is at
the end the mission so I work basically
with an attitude programmer studies here
in Germany there's Cole Gabriel and we
made what we call the conversation
tab in the subsumption visualizer and
there you can see all the available
conversation when you select one you can
basically see which participant on the
conversation are needed and then you can
check on the game which one are
available all the actors there are you
know in the world you can select them
and then press Start and you're gonna
read trigger a conversation over and
over again to you know make sure that
the flow of the logic is correct or you
know you want to test the lighting on
the game yeah you can trigger the
conversation and makeshift lighting is
good or is the setup correct yes you can
really trigger it again now you want to
see the animation blending if everything
is correct for animators they can just
make a test map you know place three
guys if the conversation has three guys
and trigger it even not in the real
environment so we're basically trying
really to make a tool that allows the
signer to speed up in their in their
process because the other thing I always
write like really to push is if you
don't allow designers to be quick in
what they're doing they will have fear
of iterating and if their fear is
already you don't get the right gameplay
the idea is basically that if you allow
designers to have the right tools they
can iterate much more on their levels
and their logic and this you can achieve
the best result for gameplay reason you
just don't want to make designer scared
of iterating over the logic like oh no
if I change this one now and it's been
at five minutes to retest it yeah I
don't have time for a dry they should
always be time for tweaking and
iterating and it's what we would
basically want to achieve the mission
system and the activities and the
reputation they all live under this
absorption umbrella so the good thing is
and this is why we did it that way is
because we want to be able to access all
different systems in within within all
the logic of the game so the mission is
basically the core flow of the game
right it can be single-player campaign
where the mission is pretty much your
campaign and then the sub missions are
the chapters of the game or the some
missions of the other chapters few
missions will be completing more like
you know generic and more dynamic and
basically this mission will access data
from the characters that are available
in the world
what they
doing what the reputation is the layout
of the world so we can access from the
object container structure for example
this like the root of the universe we
want to go to this planet and we know
exactly which planets we have available
but then there are other things that we
generate around time let's say we spawn
a pirate ship a pirate eatery's with a
specific crew member and this one is
defined in subsumption in the specific
platform structure and this spaceship
with the crew can be accessed by the
mission system to give either commands
to the guys or to create a specific
logic that you want for telling the
story right and basically this is the
reason why we spend time refactoring all
of this because it's just the only way
in which we can create specific logic
that is reusable across all the parts of
the game and that we can basically
expose the game in the right way to the
designers designers want to be able to
obviously create content for the world
and they find that they want to be able
to give like spawn ships give them
instructions tell them to fly to a point
shoot a target defend an area because
it's a new tool and it's because it's
new data that the designers are putting
in we then have to go alright cool so
you guys want to be able to defend an
area so we go away and we go right
that's what they need now so we add the
we get Tony to add the function to his
editor we then go to the game code and
build that defend an area code up so
that the ships are been able to do that
then we pass it back to the designers
who go all right great now they can
defend an area we now want them to be
able to fly off into space and a
formation and like lead an attack so
alike ok cool so it's the same sort of
thing we go back to Tony and say right
now that they've got this they want this
extra thing so he starts adding it to
his editor and meanwhile we start
handling it in the game code where we're
able to you know build up features but
one by one until the designs have this
massive tool kit available to them to
build new content there are like
different ways of getting missions and
different ways you know of just accept
missions so a lot of the your
interaction will happen through your
mobiie glass as well so you can see
what's available to you
even from a mission ever maybe it's not
gonna give you just one mission it's
gonna say like oh look I have these
bucket of missions available for you
which one you want and the same is you
know around you can say like oh no I'm
these are at this place there are these
missions that are available to me I want
to accept this one away
there's certainly two types of missions
there are the more story focused
missions I guess where there's a mission
giver who says hey I've got this
situation please go deal with it you
know here it is they give you an
objective to meet and then you fly off
and meet that objective you know or
don't meet that objective so the mission
breaker is a system that that runs on on
the server's and takes into account like
the player's reputation and criminal
status and various other like economic
factors and in the area that they're in
and generates a list of missions appear
and the players might be glass and
allows them to just accept the things
that they're interested in and it also
talks to the mission givers as well and
the mission givers can ask the mission
breaker what missions are available to
that they can offer to the player as
well so kind of does does all these
things together the other kind of
mission is kind of random encounters in
space it's possibly wrong to call them a
mission it's more of a random encounter
in space but in terms of how the
designers would set it up it would still
it would still be built as a mission
just the trigger would be you're flying
in space nothing's happened for a while
and you've ended an area that feels like
it needs some action and we go hey
here's a spontaneous mission that's
popped up you don't necessarily get an
objective it might pop up on your radar
and say there's a rescue that needs
happened or you know we've detected
pirates in the area but it would still
be handled as a mission but yeah that
that would be more of a
take-it-or-leave-it kind of situation as
opposed to the missions where someone's
explicitly said hey I've lost my dog go
find it and you're like I've got I've
got you I'm gonna accept this mission
and go do that designers can create like
timers or different logical triggers so
it can be if you enter a specific Iowa
shouldn't enter maybe you know and then
they say oh now I start to spawn lots of
or say oh you're very close to finish
you save like five other six characters
now I will send you a lot of pirates so
they can really generate the logic they
want and create the logic they want
through these tools to the super generic
and it's just very efficient because we
try also to run only the lodge that is
active in that moment so we can run a
lot of missions are a lot of characters
I've never had any interest in purely
procedural content as you know in
practice I think it tends to feel very
formulaic and repetitive and bland that
approach gives you a practically
infinite amount of variation but when
there is nothing more I think that it
falls apart on the experience it lacks
the depth to really make an area feel
alive and unique and interesting my
personal taste is that I want key NPCs
at a given location for example to have
real backstories and well thought
through motivations and reasons for
being there in the first place and not
to be NPC facades that have had their
traits rolled from a random number
generator and whose connection to the
rest of the universe feels isolated and
bereft we actually use procedural tech
extensively but it's just one of many
tools within the pipeline and its
primary purpose is to set up the
background the canvas upon which a more
detailed and intricate picture is going
to be handcrafted we're actually taking
that concept one step farther and
allowing handcrafted content to be
algorithmically placed on to procedural
backdrops and then customized in real
time based upon inputs from the game
tonio was kind of said you know the game
should be this interactive universe
right this very emergence gameplay style
universe so that rather than having
everything hard scripted and feeling
like you know it's it's been placed
there and you turn up and it just was
there it feels like it should be
reactive to the player so as the control
of power in the universe
absent flows then so should the
encounters that you come across from
experienced players seem to enjoy things
happening that aren't quite supposed to
happen so long as it's not game breaking
and so long as it's not like ludicrous
if a pirates attack popped up no in a
safe stronghold but it only happened the
once it would be this rare event that I
don't think players would have a problem
with
I mean obviously if it started happening
all the time people would start seeing
it as a bug but it is it is fun for
these things to randomly get thrown in I
mean that's that's partially the power
of the system if we were able to make it
so that it's able to choose that just
enough so that it's keeping players
entertained but at the same time not
enough that people go well this just
doesn't make sense
you know logically pirates wouldn't be
attacking this base then I guess we've
done our job right the players make
their own stories as part of the game so
it's like they're flying along they find
there's a pirate ship attacking a
civilian vessel and they fight off those
pirates and rescue the civilian and they
then later able to find that civilian
ship is elsewhere you know and it's
almost like they're tracing the threads
of these stories on their own as they're
being built around the player that's not
to say that'll always be the case I mean
sometimes it will just be here some
pirates let's fight those pirates but it
would certainly be nice if we're able to
start tying these missions together and
maybe tying missions onto the back of
other missions so you save this civilian
say you know from a pirate fight and he
turns around yours are my ship was
damaged you know I was meant to take
this this car you this valuable cargo to
somewhere and then suddenly it opens up
a whole storyline for the player where
they could potentially take that cargo
or steal at cargo depending on the
inclination of the player but it starts
letting the players build their own
stories and I know certainly from
speaking with Tony he was hoping that
like there'd be a civilian rescue
mission say see you fly in and start
defending this civilian more players
join start attacking you because they're
playing as pirates you know and then
suddenly you've got an all-out war
between a bunch of players and at that
point the players are really building
their own narrative it's less hey here's
a very small mission encounter you know
where we've turned up shot some guys and
left it's become more like hey no we
turned up to try and save this guy and
then these players turn up and started
fighting us so then I called my friends
and they turned up and started fighting
them and then we tracked them back to
their base and a whole bunch more of
them turned up when we develop a mission
from scratch we start with
a very high-level direction from Tony
and then I take that away and kind of
flesh it out into some you know a
mission with objectives and then run
that by Tony and tart and if we get
their thumbs up we we then so I sit down
and I flush it out further and I try and
think of all the ways that I can keep
this mission open to narrative dressing
as possible and a really simple example
of that is you know go collect a box
very simple objective and you can think
of thousands of weights ways to dress
that differently to make it interesting
but when you start talking about more
complex missions with several objectives
complex objectives the
a narrative dressing you can put on that
you know there's less variety you can
you can get out of it so that's where
the writers come in like I try and leave
as open as possible and give examples of
you know always I think we could do this
and then they'll just build on top of
that and give us like 10 more ways you
know we can make this sound different
you know or we might need is a different
prop for this or something and that that
process is very fluid and it's great to
work with those guys I mean we're in it
pretty much daily and communication
usually like when it comes to these you
know of a mission creation part there's
a constant back and forth of their
mission designs and then dialogue and
mission text coming back that we can go
over and go and we need this changing
because the objectives such and such
like we'll come up with things that like
affect the way the lines are written and
these like right as Dave and will will
like pitch something back to us and
we'll go that's amazing and turn it into
a mission or an objective it honestly is
really great working with those guys and
being so close to them and it's great
when they come over here as well and
it's actually sitting down with them and
then just kind of rushing out for
example that I'd say my favorite example
of that right designer relationship is
tessa Bannister who is the character who
lives on a ICC probe between the writing
the actor and like the implementation of
a lines we managed to create this really
really likable and like vibrant
character for the players you know I
mean they seem to really love it and
like my small part in that is the way we
arranged for lines like the writers will
give direction on each line today after
the way the lines come back there's
always a very slightly different tone so
she might be supposed to be a beat for
all these lines but she'll be upbeat
slightly more on one of them so what I
did was obviously I listened to all
these lines and the way I ordered from
because it was just kind of linear
progression like you meet this person
and then you do missions for her
and so when you meet her at first she's
as neutral as this actor can be she's
very like buoyant but she's quite
neutral and then for more missions you
do for her she likes you more and more
and more more friendly kind of thing
until she's genuinely excited to see you
and just building that kind of Ark there
was like I really enjoyed that and it
seems like the players really felt that
too so the intent of the mission system
is to be able to create this it's a
universe right we can't be designing
individual missions and to fill it we
have been crafting individual missions
to fill it so what we tend to do is
create mission types which themselves
can like there's a there's a bass light
flow but they can be random places it
can be a completely different reason and
for needing to do this mission you can
be attacked by different people at
different points for route it or not
there are a whole load of variables so
we create this like template that has
the option of all these variables and
then that can be generated over and over
and over and over again and I'm not
going to say you'll never play the same
mission twice like 93 Oh anyway but the
moment you have this full galaxy and
we've gone in and marked up all these
different places for it to be in come up
with all these different enemies and
search it's very unlikely you'll ever
get those same mission twice it's
exciting to be seeing all these new
gameplay elements come together when
combined players should have a wide
variety of missions and unexpected
encounters just waiting for them to
create their own star citizen story
