hello and welcome to around the verse
our weekly look at the development of
Star Citizen I'm Sandy Gardner and I'm
Chris Roberts uh we have an all Banu
show today uh a look at their law and
the newest Banu ship and later we'll
share how you can earn a trip to
Gamescom plus some fun star Kitten
rewards I wonder what star Kitten is uh
but first uh let's go to our Los Angeles
Studio update they've got some pretty
cool stuff to show
you hi everyone welcome back to Los
Angeles I'm senior producer Eric Kyon
Davis here with your monthly Studio
update we've grown to 74 total employees
across several disciplines with one
thing in common making Star Citizen and
Squadron 42 the best games possible now
some of those new hires include talented
Engineers which bring our engineering
team to about 12 all their vast and
varying experience is quickly helping to
bring more features to life across both
games soon all of our new ships will
have a heat and power component now that
the team has finished designing pipes
and begun implementing their basic
structure this will manage the flow of
respective elements to allow individual
component contribution to ship Behavior
so for example coolers now contribute to
how much heat this system can handle
rather than being statically defined by
the heat sink anyway we're currently
replacing the old system in the new
ships with this new management system
after this is done the team must
implement the minute details of each
component influencing one another for
example coolers not only affect the
overheat temperature limit they also
offer IR signature masking heat sinks
will no longer simply Define the
temperature at which components overheat
and shut down
the heat will ramp up to its desired
temperature rather than being generated
instantaneously now we've talked about
shops in our last update and now the
purchase transaction system has been
reimplemented with our new replicated
function system called remote methods
this system will decrease the amount of
calls to the server which in turn should
make purchasing things a bit more
responsive next we'll be working on
improving the Tryon mode and the client
side update to your persistent data
after purchases since the previous
update about the ultimate light switch
the Light Group entity also has several
new features its light State can also be
changed by track view which is very
useful for cinematics it allows for
individual directional lights to now
rotate with a simple property the
process was you know previously required
flow graph the light groups can now
replace the Antiquated prefabs that
vehicle external lights have been using
and now next the team aims to get the
light groups on a vehicle to rely on the
vehicle's power in order to control all
lights as well as interior devices such
as doors and lastly on the engineering
team we've been hard at work on what we
call the control manager this system
will automatically give authority over
items across the game and will allow
players to dictate the control of an
item and its sub items now in the past
we've had a system prototype for
vehicles that was hardcoded which meant
that item connections would have to be
manually defined by the designer for
instance a particular seat always
controlled a specific set of items but
now the control manager will be able to
connect to any entity for example a
designer would add a control manager to
a turret and then weapons are added the
turret that can then be controlled by
either an AI module or by an operator
seat the player this can also be added
to the vehicle with either an AI module
or again the operator seat the framework
we've set up is universal so it can be
used anywhere on anything and this isn't
restricted to weapon systems if a player
wants to control doors on a space
station
and terminals with an operator seat it
will link you and you can operate
whatever it controls now the the really
exciting thing about the control manager
is it will allow for multi grroup play
depending on which seat you're sitting
in on our test ship the person in the
operator seat controls the weapons but
can switch them to the AI Control and
then reclaim control again we've been
we've now completed adding this to data
Forge so designers no longer have to
manually State what each controller does
the system now knows what each control
operates so with a set priority it would
manage itself however if the designer
still wants to get that extra level of
control or just let the system function
as it wants to they can do so now over
on our ship team here in Los Angeles
they've completed the white box phase of
the Anvil tein and moved into the gray
box phase which includes the final Geo
on the pilot seat the cockpit the main
engines landing gear and housing
meanwhile the white boxes already up and
flying for our initial tests we've also
done some basic Rigs and animation on
the landing gear and on the landing gear
housing the team is making steady
progress on the RSI Aurora as well we're
working on cockpit controls um MFD
screens and the sleeping quarters
they've also been through General polish
such as Palms decals and lods it's
starting to look like much more than the
modern-day descendant of the X7
spacecraft and is heading to The Landing
Pad at maximum thrust now our QA team
has been quite busy they've been testing
our new ships in the pipeline and
started working on our new animation
pipeline also so one of the biggest
projects they're work undertaking is
testing the new planetary Tech on moon
such as dayar the team has had so much
fun testing this new tech that they
really don't want to go home we're
really looking forward to getting this
for to you as soon as we can in the
upcoming 3.0
release
our Tech content team has been uh very
busy supporting building improving and
assessing all of our processes and
pipelines to increase performance reduce
Dev time and help deliver every aspect
of Star Citizen and Squadron 42 for
instance with multiple asset pipelines
one of our biggest challenges is
maintaining consistency across every
asset this means that the tech art team
is constantly evaluating and auditing
our materials to achieve the best and
most efficient result to ensure such
consistency all the asset Dev teams
really need to create and maintain a
shared use of a single unified Library
maintaining such a library for a
universe full of assets requires
vigilance and maintenance our most
recently completed audit included sound
tutorials and clear documentation for
all of our best practices also uh
animation is a lot like any other asset
it has a certain memory footprint that
needs to be streamed in and out of the
game think of an animation database like
an object container but for animations
the DBA or database of of animations is
an optimized animation container
comprised of hundreds of animations
compressed down to a fraction of their
typical size on the disc splitting them
up logically is important because the
speed of streaming will be affected
depending on the size of said DBA for
example a um Locomotion set can be
fairly heavy as it's comprised of
hundreds of animations from walking
running turning idling everything in
between causing streaming of a large
file to take a few frames perhaps you've
noticed your character sliding prior to
the animation beginning which is a
product of a DBA that's just too large
so Tech animation developed a tool to
create manage and sort these animations
within that DBA our goal is to ensure
that while you're streaming seamlessly
through the star syndicon Universe your
animations will be streaming right along
with you another Boon on performance are
asset errors these can be quite
difficult to identify when the only way
to find them is parsing through a 200
megabyte text log line by line so this
month engineering Tech art and devops
teamed up to automatically output and
track errors and warnings associated
with certain assets for easy assignment
better visibility and quicker turnaround
in everything from needed fixes to
undefined behaviors that could
negatively impact the overall gameplay
experience with the implementation of
item 2.0 Characters within Star Citizen
will become fundamentally different than
the characters in our base engine so to
manage them we needed to create a
specific Loadout editor tool and now
that that editor tool has been used in
production we've made some major
improvements that allow for more
developers to get up to speed quickly on
the usage of this tool with new icons
documentation and general workflow
improvements we are now expect the
loadouts to be easier and faster to
create now our new skinning tool also
handles more complex rig setups and lods
it takes our CGA format which is a
hierarchy of animated meshes collisions
and constrained Pistons to become a
unified set of skins with lods that are
bound to an animated skeleton with
physics this tool also red reduces our
turnaround for skinning complex setups
and improves the overall
process now a critical feature required
for our characters is that the weapons
move to their designated positions
accurately when players switch armor uh
Tech art worked within the confines of
the skeleton extension system to develop
an override technique to utilize the
correct helper position based on each
asset this means attachments will now
inherent positions in real time as you
attach and detach armor pieces you don't
want your gun hanging off the wrong part
of your armor Not only would it look
silly but it can slow you down when
switching weapons after you run out of
ammo on your trusty
sidearm and also in terms of attachments
the most complex character we've set up
to date is the heavy Marine a fully
equipped heavy Marine has the most
physical attachments or weapons than any
of our other characters this presented
you know some pretty unique challenges
trying to fit four grenades eight
magazines two Med pens two gadgets one
sidearm and two weapons onto a single
character makes for quite the game of
Tetris the heavy Marine has now been
completed and is ready to hit the
battlefield fully equipped now the
character team is making solid progress
across handfuls of different outfits
uniforms and Aliens opposite of the
heavy Marine is our heavy Outlaw which
has completed its in-game mesh and will
move right on into texturing rigging and
implementation so it's not going to be
too long before the heavy Marine will
have its potential match out there in
the verse now in Squadron 42 we're
cranking through various characters from
major and from the minor background
roles and this one has now passed to the
high poly stage and move right on into
in-game modeling and texturing the OMC
unders suit has completed its high pass
making it ready for in-game mesh and for
texturing the Marine BDU has move moved
through texturing and on to its final
stages we have a Medical Rep who has
finished up her high polyphase and soon
will be in-game modeling last but not
least concepts for the Shan and Banu are
wrapping up and our newest Quest givers
rudo and miles ehart are getting ready
to meet you in the verse in the very
near future well that's it for us here
in Los Angeles thank you as always for
your support and we'll see you again
soon thanks guys watching the QA guys
Tesla Canyon runs looks like a lot of
fun and as Star Citizen grows the
persistent universe will expand to more
than just the Crusader moons yes and
definitely so not only will there be
more environments to explore but another
important aspect is other alien species
that you'll be able to interact with and
one of those alien species is the Banu
which is the first alien civilization
that Humanity discovered they might be
known as Traders and Merchants but
there's so much more to their culture
than that take a look
[Music]
so we're here to talk Banu yeah you were
here when the Banu were first thought of
like from conception right uh yeah they
were the part of the original Time
Capsule they were Humanity's first
contacts from like a meta perspective
was it just you were just trying to
think of who Humanity would encounter or
was there a need particularly for like a
trading group or early on there was sort
of in the very rough conversations with
with Chris it was I think it was just
trying to figure out like what are the
sort of Paragons of kind of creatures
and civilizations were we going to deal
with and there was always this sort of
image I remember from early
conversations about that sort of Morocco
in the 1940s like very vibrant colorful
Lush you know but with that sort of
intrigue and danger and mystery and the
back alley type thing and going off of
the the allegory of the uh you know
decline of the Roman Empire if the Shian
were sort of the influence of China and
the vandals were the vizos and the tavar
were sort of feudal Japan then the Banu
would be sort of the Persian Empire that
was sort of their initial initial role
so when it comes to the look of them the
older designs that we had had lots of
ridges on the face and they kind of a
little scarier so what I've wanted to do
with them is kind of try to bring some
color into them uh I really think that
it's a place that we can explore some
color in the Star Citizen Universe
especially with our aliens uh so right
now we're kind of getting into exploring
skin tones exploring uh you know why
they would have different skin tones why
those things would exist but then also
some of the things that I liked about
the old design was all the lines on the
face I think that's an interesting uh
design language so I've tried to pick
that up again and run with it a little
bit more Humanity's first encounter with
the bander was sort of a mixed bag there
was a it was our first Contact ever they
we discovered jump points we were able
to terraform
uh but we hadn't run into any aliens yet
and so jump points at the time obviously
still are sort of that big you know uh
Holy Grail of for exploration so people
are very protective of areas that
they're scanning and the story was that
there was this guy Vernon tar who was
out scanning this patch of space uh
looking for jump points and he saw
another ship show up on his radar and
was like convinced that someone was
trying to Horn in on his territory and
uh so he he took a shot at it and then
realized far too late that it was a
alien spacecraft and uh freaked out and
called the cops basically and yeah and
that was it and they ended up forming
the first Intergalactic treaty basically
but we found out later that the reason
why he was so happy to be found by us is
that he yeah that Banner was a fugitive
from the law it was on the run so our
first Banner that we encountered was a
criminal he had upset one of the guilds
and they were chasing him down so this
Banu who was on the run from the law
basically became I weirdly enough
probably kind of a hero of his age
something that I've been wanting to get
across is features that the players can
connect with that we can associate with
so there is a little bit of a human
element to the to this design uh you
know some a lot in the eyes a lot in
some of the general structure of the
face um but I do want to get across some
of the more creepy elements so their
skin is a little shiny and it's a little
almost Fisher eel like um you know
there's all the they're breathing the
way that it looks like they could
breathe is maybe in lots of different
places uh some crests on their head like
things that are just not really natural
things that aren't you know but also
balancing the human parts to that uh you
know in the clothing that they're
wearing it's going to be very uh
decadent right it's going to have lots
of different types of patterns in it
it's going to have lots of different um
colors in it and that's to show all
these different places that they've been
that they're not just pulling from one
influence from one location uh you it
should show a little bit of their
history just when you look at them you
should be able to see where they've been
or or who they are and where they come
from we've been really getting invested
in who the Banu are as a species and
something I find that's really
interesting with the Banu is that
they're very specialized so you know if
they're a soldier they've been trained
to be a soldier if they're a merchant
they've been trained their whole lives
to be a merchant if you know whatever
they are they they have specialized in
that and they're very specialized that's
not very typical in a lot of cultures
you know for for interest sake and for
having it be more fun we try to set up
all the cultures kind of opposed to each
other and the farther away they can get
the more interesting it is so when we
were
looking at this Trading Group we started
asking like all right what what makes
them really interesting as Traders and
then part of this use of like um
Reliance on a barter system and and that
having be the main value of the wealth
and and what do the do with etic rule of
wealth and kind of that's where it
started developing the idea that that
was the important aspect of their
society of the very real and physical
you can see what I'm worth because it's
right here with me now Look Around
that's how important I am yeah because
material things are very important to a
Bandu to signify their position and
station and life like their ships tend
to reflect this kind of artisanal
quality to it of of having really nice
nicely etched flooring stuff like that
because it's more impressive and you
know their ship that they're most known
for currently is the the merchantmen
which is a massive
massive reiterate that uh yeah cuz
that's not really like just a ship to
them used for transport that's that's
their home and that's why it's on such a
big scale that has all their belongings
aboard that they travel around with and
that kind of idea of that traveling
bizarre that they would come visiting
with people is you know kind of taking
some inspiration from early like BWI
nomadic traders that they're moving with
everything they own and it's important
to them in that way the background of
the band new is very tricky because we
we circled in on this idea that uh they
have no real sense of History like that
that's never really held a lot of
importance to them so you know they
don't you know they don't care who
invented the merchantman they just care
that the merchantman is a ship that
works and is effective at what it does
and they'll retain the sort of
instructional Manual of how to design
and build one but they could care less
that so and so built it in whatever year
on this place because of this reason
they have holds no interest to them the
what is important is this is a ship that
is built that's that's built for
transport and cargo and is and is
effective and so that's that becomes the
uh the primary thing for them yeah like
if they were viewing like American
history they the walkway for them would
be America as a country they wouldn't
care that it used to be part of Britain
because that doesn't matter anymore it's
not part of Britain anymore and they
wouldn't care that this was the
Independence year because it's
independent what difference does it make
when it happened so so long ago boiling
it down to the important facts that they
pass on so you know their history is
more like a series of manuals than it is
kind of like a timeline recording and
and because of that it's been very
difficult for humans to have pieced
together the Bandu history before they
met them the big aspect of you know
thing is about ACR stuff so ACR stuff
means you've lived a full life you've
been a lot of places you've met a lot of
people you've done a lot of things and
that's it so people it's it's very much
about living in the present so because
the Banu are so heavily in trade uh one
thing that's also interesting about them
is that they don't necessarily look
friendly right they could be a little
aggressive they could be a little
awkward um so what they try to do and
this is part of why they put all their
stuff out on display is to show you that
they're friendly right because in the
ships they're going to have rooms you
know their greeting room and when you
come into the Greening room this is all
their stuff that you you can see and
maybe Behind These closed doors it looks
totally different but put everything out
in display for you their costuming and
their clothes should also be impacted in
the same way so maybe they're carrying
lots of little trinkets or maybe uh the
types of clothes they have are from all
different places in the universe where
you know it's going to show that they
pin to all these kinds of places or
something that's very rare and very
valuable from somewhere far far away
they're trying very hard to come off as
appealing even though they naturally
aren't you know they should be a little
creepy they should be a little awkward
they should be it's kind of the judging
a book by its cover thing where they you
they probably wouldn't be the person
you're going to come up to and say like
this guy's going to be super friendly I
really want to trade with this guy but
as soon as you get to know them you can
see that they're you know very friendly
and that they're willing to to do
business with you and that they want to
make you as pleasant and as comfortable
in their in their space and around them
uh and I think that's really interesting
so it is a difficult balance to say I
want to you know when we're designing
this race that they need to both come
off as a little awkward a
little creepy a little uncomfortable um
but also friendly also appealing um and
that's I think the balance that we're
trying to capture right now with these
guys developing the Banu culture is
important because it also helps us
create other aspects of their
civilization like their ships language
design choices and many other things and
since the Bano are known for borrowing
technology from other species that idea
was actually used in their ship design
yes so up next we'll share a look at our
newest spacecraft the Banu
[Music]
Defender so the ship is called the
defender uh and it literally is that you
know it's not it's it's not an
aggressive ship I mean it's a very
unique looking ship we needed to link up
with the writing team in La so David and
will to find out what the banner about
if there are any specific things that we
needed to take in mind when we made the
ship we knew from the beginning that if
they had like a fighting ship it would
probably be an escort ship primarily cuz
what would they want to do with it they
would want to protect their valuable
trading ship what we generally do there
is we take the requirements for Ben and
Chris and we look at ships similar to
that role to see kind of where it fits
in in the universe and I think initially
there was about 18 initial initial ideas
of just different configurations often
with like the two you know the two pods
that's been a major feature uh and also
taking into account you know um you know
on the merchantman we've got the you
know there ramps feature heavily um and
trying to sort of just tie that in as
well so on this one I think Chris picked
three that he liked and then we kind of
just rifted on those um little more in
2D little more in 3D just super blocky
it's almost what looks good first and
then we can sort of come back from that
and go okay well how do we actually make
this work as we've learned more about
not only our game systems but as the the
race itself that's also been slowly
being brought up to date and adjusting
yeah and we just had a conversation with
the UK guys about like room assignment
what room does what and stuff like that
and and it's really opening up some
really interesting like some really
fascinating unique things about how how
a band new crew works and then compared
and contrasted with with a human crew
it's very very different and very weird
the Banu quite interestingly have a uh
kind of like a social system where very
specifically trained in a field unlike
the uee ships where it's just one man in
a fighter they have possibly a fighter
and a Gunner and instead of the Gunner
being in a turret they're actually
Manning the main ship weapons alongside
the pilot so they're trained to work in
tandem rather than like a generalist
role which is why there's a dual cockpit
system going on with it right off the
bat we did like a typical sort of human
configuration uh you know things in
racks and it was it was instantly
obvious that that wasn't going to work
uh it was out of place the whole
rigidity and the structure was um
complete opposite to what we're sort of
trying to get for the interior and so
that there was a lot of there was a lot
of drawing a lot of line work just to
sort of again it was all about flow FL
lines you know curving from the roof
down to the floor so after a little more
chat with Nate and uh Jay Brushwood like
we decided to really go for like a sort
of uh almost it's like a vertical
horizontal shutter system basically so
this whole thing will just like open up
and just go and just reveal all the
components and they'll be they will be
in a sort of structure but um the facade
is still very sort of our no Novo
sweeping organic um and it it'll make
quite a nice experience I think should
be there you'll push the button you'll
have this
reveal um and you know then you can
change out your components or you know
change your fuses or whatever it is that
you want to do so The Defender as an
example has a bigger Shield than most of
the fighters we've got in the game uh
especially of the same size however as a
counter point it's got a very weak hole
so the second you get through that
Shield
you're in trouble you know the the
defender has a Shon engine on it and at
a certain point they were like oh this
engine's much better suited for this
ship than the previous engine that we
had on there so they got the engine
design they retro engineered it they
figured it out theyve started
manufacturing it and now it's a Shon
engine incorporated into their Tech it
kind of comes in two configurations as
like a flight configuration and a landed
configuration um you know I really like
the landed configuration it just creates
a really nice silhouette and you and you
know you'll know straight away that's
the defender when you see it on a
landing pad there's just no way you'll
mistake it one of the things that we've
been talking about internally was the
idea that they as a culture they don't
have art Fine Art but the idea being
that that that kind of Creative Energy
goes into the manufacturing of the thing
so that's why they like all their stuff
has really beautiful kind of quality to
it and also the way they build their
ships you can see the pride in how it
represents their own personal worth in
the art Artistry behind it the in
intricacy like it's just beautiful to
look at and that's because of how much
it represents who they are both me and
Nate and design have been uh heavily
involved working with a concept artist
for a pallet that sort of invokes a
richness basically so muted Golds uh you
know pale Golds there's you know there's
hints to sort of gemstones integrated in
a very functional way so they're sort of
used as light accents while flying is
quite involved so is the shooting
especially when you've got the gimbaled
weapons on the front you're not waiting
for the pilot to line up a shot directly
you'll be able to have a little bit of
movement there yourself so while the
Pilot's trying to track the target the
Gunner will be able to shoot within a
nice range of that the Dual seats kind
of came about because we also wanted the
seats to eject and we really didn't want
to force the pilot to eject the Gunner
as well but you also not restricted to
this pilot Gunner thing either because
this ship is a Bano ship produced for
humans you will be able to get in there
flight on your own be the pilot and the
Gunner but if you want a friend to pop
in there with you they can do some
engineering work they can jump on the
weapons if they want to so you're a bit
more free and this is uh this has been
quite exciting I think the whole team is
pretty is pretty sort of uh pretty
excited to work on it it sounds a bit of
a crazy mix um but when you know when
when people see the images you know it
all it all comes together and it's very
obviously not human and hopefully
obviously Banu but I think yeah it's
going to be it's going to be good I'm
I'm looking forward to seeing it sort of
uh come through the production process
and and then turn up on people's
screens the Banu Defender makes a great
companion piece to the merchantman by
protecting valuable cargo that many Banu
Merchants depend on or cargo that you
have you depend on too yes and starting
tomorrow you can get your very own Bano
Defender this sale ends May 1st so don't
miss your chance to add this special
ship to your hanger yeah we've also put
together a helpful guide to interacting
with the Banu on our website complete
with travel tips for anyone planning a
Voyage to the protectorate it's really
cool and I definitely recommend checking
out up next we have a special
announcement regarding our Star Citizen
referral program and referral
contest yeah not only have we added new
reward levels to the program you can
also now earn a special trip to this
year's gamescon take a
look
hello citizens I'm Sandy Gardner welcome
to the million mile high club I'm here
with Tyler Nolan to discuss our new 2017
RSI referral contest and updated
referral program if you aren't familiar
with Star Citizen referral program it's
a way to earn in-game rewards by
recruiting friends to Star Citizen we're
now adding new levels to referral ladder
which you can see on the referral
program page and now on to the really
fun part the new referral contest any
new citizens you recruit from the start
of the contest until August 8th will get
you additional in-game rewards it only
takes one new referral point to get an
in-game star Kitten t-shirt that your
character can wear in the verse and you
can also get a star Kitten pink
dragonfly by gaining 10 new referral
points before the contest ends but
remember to receive these fun star
Kitten prizes you have to get these
referral points during the contest you
might be asking yourself what's star
Kitten star Kitten is our new in-lore
product line Sally is the first member
of the star Kitten family you can learn
more about her on the referral program
page so it doesn't matter whether you
have no referrals so far or 1,000 once
the contest starts your next referral
gets you star Kitten it's the perfect
shirt to wear in the verse that's not
all the referral contest gets even
better the first person who has a
lifetime total of 2942 referral points
by August 8th will receive a free trip
to games come plus whichever other
backer has the highest lifetime total of
referral points at the end of the
contest will receive an Idis M the
Gamescom trip will include an event
ticket airfare hotel stay for one and a
chance to meet with Chris Roberts and
other members of the cig development
team while the interest M will include a
chance to blow a lot of stuff up woohoo
again to earn a free trip to Gamescom
the magic total to reach is 2942 points
using Star Citizen referral codes we
already have some great contenders vying
for the Gamescom package let's take a
look uh man I heard about the game you
know really when it first started up
when the crowd funding pretty early on
and for me it was about finding
something that wasn't out there I think
