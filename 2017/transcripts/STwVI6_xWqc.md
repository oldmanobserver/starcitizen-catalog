## Transcript

welcome to another episode of around the
verse our weekly look at star scissors
ongoing development I'm Chris Roberts
and I'm Eric Kiron Davis so on today's
show we'll examine what it takes to
build a solar system a process that
includes everything from extensive
astronomical research to the creation of
a new tool that we're calling Sal Ed
yeah plus we have a ship shape that you
will KNX want to miss that's so bad but
first let's pay a visit to Frankfurt for
a studio
update hello I'm Brian Chambers
development director of our Foundry 42
Frankfurt office this month the team
grew by an additional two people
bringing us to a total of 76 employees
this month we had 20 of those employees
participate in a local 5K run here in
Frankfurt
nobody necessarily participated in hopes
of winning but it was a good opportunity
to hang out after work and have some fun
and exercise so let's start off this
month with checking in with the level
design team the level design team
finished the main part of the work they
needed to do for the surface Outpost and
they're now in the hands of the
environment art team they also had white
boxes for both the modular hangers and
garages approved and those were handed
over to the r team as well for their
visual exploration phase with the white
boxing phase complete they're currently
focusing on implementing the markup
required for all our locations this
involves everything from room systems
and breathing environment interactions
like vaulting elevators and consoles for
spawning ships and
vehicles Levi will have a combination of
hangers and garages to spawn ships as
well as vehicles to explore the
planetary surface
with the bulk of the work completed on
the previously mentioned locations
they're now moving over to the remaining
Flagship Landing zones for the Stanton
system the first ones on that list are
Area 18 and lorville followed by orison
and new babage the engine team worked on
consistent capturing of both atmosphere
and sky in Cube Maps so we can
seamlessly blend between Global
atmosphere and local Cube map based
lighting this will ultimately give us a
higher level of visual Fidelity they
implemented an improved compression
algorithm for the new pack file system
to allow for more efficient data
streaming due to reduced CPU overhead
during
decompression this is part of the new
incremental Patcher which will
ultimately make patches and updates much
more efficient they also did some work
on our internal tool called planed we
have several needs for marking areas on
a planet to identify where specific
objects should be spawned within an
ecosystem areas to be punched out to
embed brushes or complex structures such
as Landing zones the code for this was
unified so it's easier to reuse and
extend in the future as even more
functionality in this regard is needed
the AI team has been busy as usual uh
this month they did some work on buddy
aai where NPCs will intelligently follow
a designated leader they also oo made
progress on ship AI getting it one step
closer to be fully controlled via
subsumption one Sprint they did this
past month was focused on human combat
they spent time refining behaviors for
First Reactions to enemies seen and
events heard the reactions vary in
direction and speed from casual
situations to Quick reactions to loud
events and so on the clips you see here
are put together in a way that just
verifies the behavior via triggering the
appropriate animation from a start pose
to the action intended once the behavior
is verified they'll get fully hooked up
in game and the popping won't occur they
also did some additional work on
Friendly Fire to make sure friendlies
are identified correctly in combat
situations if and wi
[Music]
needed the Frankfurt VFX team has been
continuing to work on effects for the
various Planet surface types this covers
a wide range of effects from simple
footsteps to weapon impacts and vehicle
Tire effects
[Music]
they also did some early experimenting
with rigid body simulations and the
workflow for squadron 42 cinematics this
will cover the many mesh destruction and
deformation animations that are required
for the Squadron 42 single player
missions the lighting team has has been
very busy bringing all surface outposts
to their final lighting this involves
creating a consistent set of lighting
fixtures temperature charts and rules
which we can use to define how each type
of outpost looks we've also created a
library of prefabs combining existing
props with lighting Elements which can
be easily iterated on and propagated
across all outposts
the techar team had a variety of tasks
this month they continued to create
numerous mannequin animation fragments
for the Cinematic team they implemented
the game entity for the new Kar
custodian SMG energy weapon with the
blocked out mesh and rig now that it's
implemented other departments can start
working with it in game such as
animation and
VFX they added addition features to our
internal play blast tool to make it
easier for the animators to create
simple play blasts of their work which
are primarily used for animation reviews
they also made great progress with the
new weapon Dynamics and secondary
motions using both in-game physics and
simulation the initial results are
promising and secondary animation will
add one more level of subtle detail and
realism to the verse

[Applause]
[Music]
the build engineer team grew by one
member this month bringing us to a total
of two here in Frankfurt so a good
amount of time was spent getting him up
to speed on how we function they are
ultimately both responsible for build
support for our European offices as well
as working on both mid and long-term
plans to increase both efficiency and
reliability of our build process for the
environment our team this month with the
updated material distrib bution the
ecosystem ground materials have been
improved on all three moons adding a
more varied breakup of the materials on
the ground the team is also close to
wrapping up work on the landing pads
that will go with the surface Outpost
these landing pads will give the players
a stable solid Landing point on what
otherwise might be a rough
Landing the surface of Delmar is getting
its final polish with geometry and
materials being updated and fine-tuned
the surface is also getting an fx pass
adding an extra layer of visual interest
to the environment and atmosphere the
area surrounding Lei will also have more
areas of interest for players to explore
in Lei final touches are being put into
the Customs area all player traffic in
and out of leski will have to go through
this checkpoint so extra effort is being
put into making visually interesting and
ultimately hard for players to smuggle
in unwanted Goods the work on the
garages is close to done and ready to be
included in the level once this work is
completed players will be able to
request a vehicle in the garage and go
out and explore the Daryl Marsh surface
the elevators in leki have also been
updated with new models fitting the
modular building set that we're using
across the entire game the game
programming team has been working on
finishing up the remaining weapon
features for 3.0 such as the rail gun
cover animations delayed coils and
delayed ads reticule they also completed
the first iteration of the doors and air
locks that we mentioned recently now the
technical hooks for adding VFX and sound
effects are being implemented and
they'll be ready for the rest of the
team to
use with the help of other Engineers
from both the UK and LA offices the
technical design for the network code of
the new weapon system is being fleshed
out and the overall research phase is
coming to an end the first test
implementations will be started as soon
as all other 3.0 3.0 tasks are completed
cinematics is working with UK Graphics
engineering to test out first working
version of our brand new holographic
projection volume entity Tech this piece
of tech essentially provides a Target
holographic volume with content fed from
a source scene that gets rendered into
the volume it would allow us to example
have Larger than Life characters
communicating via hologram with
characters in a scene or have the holog
globe switch to a scripted mode and show
Mission briefings all in real time
without resorting to things like
pre-rendered Motion Graphics this Tech
minus the holographic component will
also be used to get comm's calls from
other ships and their cockpits in real
time such as the cockpit mfds or other
displays as usual team has also made
great progress across multiple chapters
for squadron 42
we look forward to showing things off in
the near future the Frankfurt QA team
started testing the new Sig data Patcher
in May and testing has continued through
into June Patcher testing is done daily
as well as on the client editor and
dedicated game server copied via Sig
data Patcher our main goal is to make
sure there are no differences between
builds pulled via the new Patcher and
builds pulled with our current internal
build tool copy build 2 copy build 3 has
also been rolled out to QA at the
beginning of June and has been its QA
testing phase in conjunction with Sig
data Peter subsumption editor testing
continues to be a regular part of their
weekly task as new versions with new
features become available QA Works
closely with Tony Z and Franchesco Ruchi
in order to ensure that each subsumption
edit or release is free of anything that
could pluck the development process they
also spent a good portion of time
testing multiplayer game play in the
Staton system persistent universe level
the system design team continue to
expand the library of usables to be used
for both the Pu and Squadron 42 the air
traffic control is also making Headway
and you should be able to experience
this ing game fairly soon they started
work on the FPS companion sluddy aai
including all the orders you can give
them and the behaviors needed for those
orders to take effect the actor status
system is being internally tested right
now and is going through its final
tweaking and balancing they've also put
some finishing touches to the
conversation system to allow our
cinematics team to create the best
experiences possible the weapons team
blocked out numerous Universal grip and
Optics attachments they're converting
the older blocked out attachments to
work with our new attachment rail system
and doing a quick first pass to test
them on the existing guns to see how
well they work and if of the designs
need to be adjusted they also completed
the first pass blockout for the Clon
verer demo which is a laser light
machine gun for ship weapons they
finished the preacher armaments
Distortion size 4- six and upgrade
levels 1 through three they also did a
first pass blockout including rough
animations for the Clausen verer laser
repeater size 1 through three the
neutron repeater S1 through S3 and the
apocalypse arms ballistic scatter gun S1
through
S3 and to close out the update earlier
this month a large amount of people from
the office attended a local bar citizen
here in Frankfurt good people good
conversations it was a really fun time
and we're glad they organized
it that wraps up this month's update
from Frankfurt we all really appreciate
the support and feedback you give us we
couldn't do this without you guys and
we'll see you in the
verse the VFX work on Planet
environments it's it's really looking
great yeah I know being able to see your
Footsteps in the snow or having your
vehicle kick up dust while speeding
across the desert are those little
details will make you believe that
you're really in those environments and
be much more immersive you know me I
love immersive yeah yeah we do another
way you'll be experiencing these
environments is from the seat of aox
although the concept sale begins
tomorrow we've got a special ship shape
today to give you a sneak peek at this
new open canopy racer
hi my name is Chris Smith and I'm the
elite vehicle artist in the ATX office
I'm currently working on the Knox bike
which is a xan bike made by AOA has xan
technology involved much like the Scout
and it's you know a very stylish bike
and it's supposed to sort of compete
with the dragonfly well the dragonfly
was made you know with a lot of sort of
exploring and scouting in mind I think
this bike on the other hand is a little
bit more purposed towards either racing
or combat but it's going to be very fast
and Nimble uh and it's going to be
powerful in combat the concept was uh
provided from England this time it was
only a 2d concept though uh usually here
uh we we start with 3D Concepts for this
bike though we didn't really have too
much time uh for that concept initial
concept phase it was worked out in a
fairly quick Manner and only on 2D so
this was a bike that I got to actually
built from the ground up literally the
first poly you know from the ground up
which was was quite enjoyable so
building the xan bike wasn't terribly
challenging cuz we used the xan
technology which uses magnet technology
and it kind of made connecting points a
little bit easier so we decided to have
like the Nels floating and they're
connected by magnetism and the
handlebars the same way and sort of the
plates slide along we try to infuse a
lot of style of the xon technology in
there and use like a mix between sort of
like heavy metals and and exotic
materials the main challenge was to make
sure that uh we sort of Nathan dearle
helped in the concepting it with Gary
Sanchez he told me that he really wanted
to like from afar look like like this
little monolithic sort of simplified
thing like sort of ominous looking uh
shape from a distance and then when you
get closer you know it reveals more
detail the main challenge was to kind of
get that feeling across and and make
sure I hit that the xon technology the
skin of the the bike is definitely going
to be an armored type the the rider
itself is protected by the bike when he
gets on it has these sort of shells that
come up above his back so the rider has
a little bit more protection you know
from behind the main thing that sets xan
technology apart from like let's say RSI
or uh agis would be the rider has a much
more aggressive stance on the bike than
on the dragonfly so the dragonfly is
more the upright stance right this xan
bike has like a race bike type stance so
you're forward leaning it's it's more
racer type uh your legs are back that
gives that gives a little bit more uh
maneuverability and then also that way
you can kind of get a little shell and a
little bit more protection over the guy
so I mean it's still open on the sides
and everything but you just get like a
little extra protection from those
shells in the back the xan bike uh is
actually going to use a holographic Hood
system in order to try to streamline
everything and make it technologically
advanced we try to minimize the amount
of screens as much as possible once you
get on the bike and initially there's
not going to be any screens there
there's one little screen by you and
right in front of you but that's sort of
flat and that comes up a little bit but
everything else will like come up as a
holographic image in front of you which
looks really cool and the startup
sequence is pretty neat hi uh I'm
Patrick solerno technical artist at
Cloud imperum games um I focus on mainly
destruction systems and optimization for
the
spaceships uh functionality to
at the end I make things sure things
work but um I kind of have a checklist
of things that I go through when I'm
doing the spaceships uh it's like the
there's a couple Tech art passes that
the ships go through uh in particular
we'll be talking about the KNX today and
the setup that went into that and if it
differs from any other ships that I've
worked on most of the ships that you see
in game I've probably touched in terms
of either lighting or particles or
damage or something um during some point
in the process I get the model from the
artist he's like it's done you know and
before this we've talked about how it's
going to break off which pieces are
going to break off of where sometimes
there's small changes down the process
we're like oh those intakes or those
weapon racks might be able to break off
you know we can add a little bit more
detail or gameplay so I'm working with
design I'm working with art and we're
trying to make sure that by the time I
get it there's really no back and forth
you know like I don't have to go oh Mr
artist guy there's something you have to
do here so I take it from there and what
I do is if we're looking at this ship
here I will look at it in Max and I'll
break it apart
and we'll say okay so if the nose comes
off from the front of the ship then it
has to detach and fly off how do we do
that how do we make all those pieces
work together and look good well for
that I usually hop into the XML from
there so before even working on like the
art side of it like making the metal
wear and stuff I have to work on the
functionality side where the debris
happens so shoot the ship and it
explodes the pieces have to fly off in
certain directions those are called
vectors those are impulse pules right
you know boom Ship Happens it explodes
now what happens is I'm kind of tying in
multiple effects together at the same
time I'm saying I have particles to work
with when I'm shooting the ship so all
these little green squares you see here
are kind of uh what are called helpers
in Max and uh helpers are all these
little green squares you see and they
can serve a bunch of different purposes
for we want to use them for uh for my
particular purpose I use them like C4
charges like little explosives uh that
will happen and what they'll do is
they'll burst in say a radius and I'll
set the radius in my list and on the
name of it and that gets put into the
XML and from there I then update the
ship and I shoot the ship and I can test
my new particles so it's a bit of back
and forth right you know you want to go
in shoot it see what happens check your
particles check your fire you know make
sure everything looks all right if the
modelers put in specific uh things like
wires and girds and stuff and tubes you
know you want to take that into account
when you're putting down a particle now
mind you I don't necessarily make the
libraries and uh I go in and I'll pick
from say you know lowtech high-tech
chanch Vandal Tech type you know uh
particle libraries so luckily these guys
had a cool one they're kind of like high
energy blue alien Tech so I had a lot of
fun with that um just sort of like
shooting and testing it so once I get
the debris flying off let's move on the
next phase I set up what's called the UV
2s and the Damage map right that that is
our system where the ship actually melts
and wears now when we do this system we
have to take into account um the
underlying surface detail it's very
important so the modelers will actually
model gerter and underlying stuff and
there's two types of underlying sort of
surface detail there's 2D and 3D go uh
2dg is like this it's called a palm
Parallax seclusion map it's this one
polygon that goes under the surface of
the hole no matter what it shape is and
when you shoot the ship and it melts
you'll end up seeing that underlying
sort of metal or girds or wires or
whatever is not actually like you know
it's supposed to be there so you don't
see through the ship polygons are only
one-sided right so light hits it that's
it but if you're looking at the other
side you can see right through so uh we
take that into account so for that to
work the ships need two UV sets and in
case you're not sure what UV set is a UV
set is what Maps your texture so like
the wood on this surface or some kind of
other uh wear like thing so UV 1's are
for your ship texture and UV 2s are for
the procedural damage map um once we
start shooting that everything kind of
works in conjunction so I have my
initial debris with the pieces flying
off and the breakability activating the
particles which then set off say fire
smoke electricity then spins off and
then Fades out now after I'm done with
all the you know fun creative stuff you
know there's the making sure things work
and is optimized and runs well uh
there's also another layer to that when
you're doing the Shader damage and it's
doing the melty effect and it's trying
to show the underlying stuff we use what
are called vertex colors on the ship and
vertex colors are basically every
verticy a polygon is made of these
little points points of vertices each
one can hold data uh we use that color
data to tell the map that it can be
transparent or not so um what I do is
I'll go in and all these different
colors mean just a slightly different
level of damage right so say for example
there's really no damage under the nose
right but I still want it to show the
uv2 dam still looks like it's getting
dented and worn right I can set it to a
certain color that can block the punch
through of the damage that means you
might not be able to see the underside
of the ship now for somewhere in the
back I can do it a little differently
where I can layer the damage so if
there's really nothing under here I can
set that you can't punch through but you
can slowly Whittle through different
areas of the ship um then I just go
through and I kind of layer that across
the ship and create levels of damage it
creates a little bit more Randomness
when you're firing at it some areas will
get huge hole throughs and other areas
might look like they're just wearing a
bit harder so yeah but after I have all
that set up I kind of work on the lights
right I want to make sure that lighting
Works uh most of the time lights are set
up by the artists themselves uh the ones
who are doing the ship or the lighting
artists um so if there are no lights set
up which I was lucky enough to have at
the time with this uh I had a little
back and forth with Chris Smith about it
and he polished it off but um basically
I got to set up some of the lights on
this ship and this was kind of fun
because as an alien ship the theme was
more of a high-tech sort of vibe most of
our ships have more traditional Fire
spark smoke etc etc so uh luckily there
were Shen libraries and some Hightech
libraries I got to play with for this
ship and when I was shooting it
different weapons have different effects
we shoot this we see we get a sort of
melty burny wear if we pull out a rifle
we get bullets now the bullets can
actually sort of tear a hole in the ship
which is fun boom and then change the
lighting conditions fire smoke etc etc
so at the end that's how all the pieces
come together right the process takes a
bit longer than that but uh at the end
it's pretty fun and just sort of picking
which pieces explode and killing the
ship and I mean it's important to take
in account the functionality ship when
deciding how it's going to be destroyed
like you know with this guy there were
really only two or three pieces you
could blow off like nose sort of the
seat area and the tail so how do you how
do you make that look different every
time you want to blow up the ship you
know I I don't really like it when
damage always looks the same so my goal
is to add sort of Randomness and variety
to it uh one more cool thing that I have
is to show is this new debug gun we have
for testing the damage normally I shoot
it right I use different weapon types to
see what happened if you're going across
a ship but we have this thing called a
damage gun now for debugging our
materials and see all I have to do is
kind of look at the ship now this
doesn't help me with actually blowing
off pieces of the ship that still
doesn't quite work but but uh that's
where I shoot the ship with an actual
gun but you can see I can test out my
damage map which you can see up here in
the corner then that wears away this is
what I was talking about with the
transparency you can see slowly eats
away at the ship so if there's really
nothing under there I don't want to
actually expose that to the player right
so I just I do the vertex colors that
you see over here to block off certain
areas like this has a lot of vertex
colors there's not much going on but um
I'd say that's pretty much it and then I
just I test it all and I bring it all
together and I give it polish and then I
hand it off to the final people for
functionality and testing working on the
xan bike was actually pretty neat
because it was the first non ship that I
got to build for this company I did use
bike references for some of the details
like you know engine details because the
Gian sort of has like a naked bottom
it's not totally covered you know so it
shows some of the mechanics and stuff so
I definitely use some real life
motorcycle reference from that and I'm
into motorcycles so I was very glad this
F in my lap it's very sexy so I had a
lot of fun working on it
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
as Chris Smith mentioned building the
nox was made easier because the apoa
ship pipeline was already established
having such systems in place are key to
reducing development times going forward
yeah especially when building a game of
such size and scope scope another
example of the solid a tool we've
created to make building solar systems
easier yeah that's right cry engine as
you all know was not meant to handle
game with the maps the size of an entire
solar system let alone even 10 or 20
kilometers across so it made placing
objects difficult and time consuming uh
so now let's take a look at what it
takes to build a solar system from
scratch I'm Luke Presley I'm lead
designer on Star Citizen live hello I'm
uh Sher hyberg I'm the archist here cig
I'm Dave hack I'm the lead writer over
at C recently I was on a Bren uh con
panel and I got asked is there any
unsunk heroes in the um Star Citizen
Tech things that aren't flashy enough to
get their own kind of featurettes or
anything but which make our lives
possible kind of thing we're building a
solar system um well we're building a
Galaxy so how do we build a solar system
we recently got a new tool called the
the solar system Ed or Sol Ed as we call
it it was something that was kind of we
we made the brief here and then Sasha
hober in Germany um actually built of a
tool what it allows us to do is um well
build a solar system build a hierarchy I
bring in a sun and then I give it
children which of the planets then I
give those children which of the moons
and then I can give those children which
are you know satellites and I can very
easily give them an orbital distance and
just have you know created the the whole
thing in a matter of minutes and that
sounds really simple it sounds like
something we should have been able to do
from day one when we
started uh getting close to the the
deadline for the star map we had to do a
kind of heavy internal push to generate
a lot of uh of of star systems we were
sort of
thinking you know oh this would be cool
to have a system like this and it would
be cool to have a star like this and you
know astronomy virtually every day
you're finding new cool stuff that's
happening so it's we were trying to get
as much of that stuff in there we were
sort of faced with this thing of like
well we should probably see cuz there's
such an emphasis on like realism and
while it may not be entirely accurate
like plausible I think was sort of the
term when we were building Crusader for
instance for 2.0 what we'd have to do is
we'd bring in Crusader and we'd set that
down at the origin which is 0000 0 in
the XY Z and then we'd bring in a moon
and that' be on 0000 as well to get it
to the right orbital distance we'd have
to move it in either just the x or just
the Y away from the planet and that's in
meters as well so you can imagine how
many meters away of a moon is from a
planet and then obviously if you've got
three of these moons um you don't want
them all at 90° from the planet so that
means you've got to add some rotation on
which means what we had to do was like
we' put down another object in the
middle of um Crusader at the origin and
we'd physically link it to the moon and
then we'd start twisting that would move
the moon around too and you wouldn't be
able to see it because it'd be too far
away and the moment you've moved it off
of like pure Zed or pure pure X or pure
y sorry um You've Lost That one one pure
number it becomes some two numbers that
you have to do maths on to figure out so
it's not it wasn't allowing us to be
able to change this in future imagine if
a scale changed um we just have to start
again what the solid allows us to do is
you know if we change the Scale of the
Universe we just scale down the numbers
for uh the orbit orbital distance away
from its parent like in a matter of
minutes you would have a rescaled solar
system we try our best to make things as
accurate as possible but still respect
the need for the players to actually
enjoy what we have we got a bunch of
astrophysicists the writers gave them
the brief for reach of these solar
systems they went away and came back
with a spreadsheet that has an
unbelievable amount of data in there
more than we could ever use there's a
service that actually U Collective of
scientists and researchers and stuff
like that who basically volunteer their
time to screenwriters video games stuff
like that uh you can contact them and
they basically will put you in touch
with an expert yeah he was an
astrophysicist who had served as a
consultant on other properties before we
learned about star types and green bands
and how long it takes to evolve life and
the density of asteroid belts and we
basically got a crash course on how to
build a system from scratch if you're
not a scientist they went to town on
this so the the list that basically Sher
worked with them on was like everything
from the size of the the system itself
to where's the green band start where
does it stop where's the frostline start
daily rotations orbital rotations
parhelion I mean I'm going to throw out
terms that I don't know what they mean
but like you know the uh odd orbital
patterns you know inclination de all
this stuff we kind of just take for now
the the size and the distance from uh
the orbital distance from its parent but
obviously um things like the density
will affect the gravity of the thing
eventually it even goes into details
like how the mass of a asteroid ring so
if you took all the asteroids and
combine them together what the mass of
that would be it's extremely detailed
and these guys know what they're talking
about so our solar systems are going to
be extremely like realistic obviously we
scale it to keep it you know a a
playable because you know no one
actually wants to drive around around
the Earth but also like you know to keep
the tech um working like we we can't
make any Planet say biger than Earth
right now so that means we have to bring
everything slightly in so that we can do
these super um super Earths like arore
they were able to build the systems with
respect to orbit they didn't want to
cause like a bad orbital orbital
resonance situation so the planets were
a certain amount of au apart and in a
certain position so that the orbits
wouldn't fling planets out of the system
so an au is an astronomical unit it's a
standard unit of measurement used in
astronomy astrophysics and it's the
distance between the Earth and the Sun
it's used so that you can easily
communicate vast distances in solar
systems our solar system for example is
around 50 Au if you include the orc
cloud and Pluto and all of that uh it's
basically so you don't have to say
something like this system is
575 trillion 8 9
b473 km it'll factor in based on what
our our time dilation system is like how
long a day is in the game whether it's
that's at of scale because it might
actually in a weird way I I don't know
about the formula but it might actually
balance out that basically if like if if
the time was running at a tenth of this
or 90% faster or whatever then it would
equal out the distance traveled would
make sense you know if you scale it back
to normal time I think it was almost a
year trying to get uh all the numbers in
and we went through many processes of
going back and checking to see whether
or not the numbers that they gave us
reflected consistently with the lore we
had given whenever we had questions
about stuff that we wanted to make real
but couldn't we would talk to the
astrophysicists and they would usually
give us good ideas there are some things
that we weren't able to keep entirely
real like um asteroid belts for example
in real life asteroid belts the distance
between asteroids is so vast that it
wouldn't pose an issue or an obstacle to
any kind of race for example you would
just Mose on through it it would just be
like going through regular space
asteroid belts in our game are denser
it's not like real life but it's a lot
more fun and also we would have
situations where they would say Hey you
know um what you have presented in the
lore is not possible you know but what
you can do is if you change this this
and this you know it's a minimal rcon
for the backer's perspective but it will
kind of pull it into scientific
feasibility which was sort of the middle
ground we kind of aim for but the thing
we also learned was that space could be
crazy you know oh this can't happen and
then a week later something would come
out in the you know NASA or something be
like oh by the way there's a diamond
planet and we're like yeah there's a
diamond planet there's a planet where it
rains glass there's a stellar Cloud
that's supposed to taste like raspberry
schnap Space is really weird it's a gas
giant that's the color of coal like pure
pitch black that we stole yeah we
definitely stole that yeah space be
crazy the things with placing with um
the solid um are obviously right now the
the uh procedural planets Crusader will
be um a different entity because it's a
gas giant it'll be a gas giant entity
that um we've not got the tech for yet
but we'll have an amazing Shader that
goes goes around it and creates creates
these wisps and and these eyes and
storms obviously we can also as I said
before plan um put satellites going
around and things like that we also
placed for the asteroid uh ring around
the solar system with it they are
building the systems on a on10th scale
so for example if we have a system
that's 200 Au in our notes it comes out
as 20 Au in the uh the system that the
designers are building so that like
number one it can it's a lot more fun
for the players this way because systems
that if we had like a 200 Au system it
would take I don't know years for the
players to get across it even it's just
such a such ridiculous amount of time
it's an inedible distance so we needed
to scale it down so that number one it
would be fun for the players and number
two that we could build the whole thing
and seamlessly within our engine Quantum
travel is is kind of locked at around
on10th the speed of light so you know
even at that you know it's going to take
a really long time yeah to fly from
place to place so with real long haul
travel things it's going to take I won't
say where the example took place but
there was a situation where something
was going to be traveling in Quantum
travel for 20 minutes so you know break
out your cards and load up your Netflix
queue while you're in Quantum travel you
could get up out of your chair I mean
considering you have a multi Cru ship
you would get up out of your chair and
stuff like that and if something yanked
you out of it then you would have to you
know run back and it's also the thing
it's like Quantum travel travel the idea
was that Quantum travel only moves in
straight lines the reason why you don't
your body doesn't liquefy is that
there's a sort of anti-grav bubble
around you but because you're moving in
a in a straight line you know you're not
getting that sort of the intense
pressure but if you were to turn
suddenly you go flying against the wall
at one tenen the speed of light which
probably hurt yeah yeah might might hurt
a
little a little bit it feels like this
sort of adherence to you know again even
at like a on10th scale I mean in 30 I
mean we're starting off with the moons
the moons of of Crusader and I mean
they're huge you know it takes 15 hours
to drive it like around once the
interesting balance is going to be um
how do we achieve this sort of like the
the crafted experience with the the
massive scale like that sort of vast
openness but still feel like there's you
know that there's interesting flavors to
all the places you go My Hope Is that
the players will see the numbers that we
have generated for them the care that
we've put into designing the systems and
we'll know that they have all this
information at their fingertips and know
how real we want the systems to be for
them we would never be able to
create let one solar system let alone
you know the hundreds of solar systems
we're going to be able to we're going to
have to make if it wasn't for this tool
you you can imagine like the the amount
of hours it would take to to hand move
these out because the cry engine was
never built to do this you know again I
say it's it sounds extremely simple and
it is a simple tool
but it wasn't there out the
box so an incredible amount of work went
into coming up with over 100 systems and
scientifically vetting them but now we
have all the information it makes it
easier to build them in solid yeah for
example the the Stanton system which
we're currently building out is just
over 800 million km across even after
scaling it down by a factor of 10 yeah
that's pretty amazing at a distance um
so anyway that's it for today's ATV
thanks to all our subscribers for
helping us make shows like this each
week yes and thank you to all of our
backers we really couldn't do this
without you oh and if you're as excited
as I am to hop on a nox and speed across
a planet don't forget to check out the
concept sale tomorrow yeah definitely
check it out so until next week we'll
see you
around the ver
