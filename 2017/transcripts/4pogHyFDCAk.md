hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers I
am your host Mark aent and I'm here to
show you the
bugs bug
[Music]
bashes hey we are here on an awesome
planet and I just stole some cargo from
that Drake ship and what's cool is I
could actually place this down anywhere
I want but I want to place it in my ship
so let's walk up
there and O it's hitting the shield
that's fun but oh no I can't place it
into my ship I can't loudly enough I can
place it outside with an awesome jittery
bug oh no what's happening
well my crate vanished I've officially
lost my crate and it's back all right
let's take a look and see what is
happening but before we do um which to
say what's going on is if I hold down F
I go into this awesome new interaction
mode that's going to be coming for 3.0
um where it shows me a list of things
that I can interact with and if I click
place I could interact with this cargo
Grid or cargo container that I have and
I could place it on the ground now
ideally I should be able to place it
anywhere so I can place it on the
planet and I should be able to place it
on my ship however going into the ship I
have a hard time because well this
planet actually has a coordinate system
and the ship has a coordinate system and
when I cross between the planet's
coordinate system to the vehicle one all
things just go Bonkers so let's step
into the awesome
code so here is is um the player choice
component this is the thing that when I
hold f it allows me to place the uh
cargo thing around or do some kind of
interaction and unfortunately this guy
is doing everything in World space so
when I try to place the cargo grid into
the ship it's freaking out because it
can't figure out between the planet Zone
and the ship Zone where it should place
it and if I actually move it from World
space or the whole or let me step back
in our whole universe we have a root U
coordinate system then we have a planet
and then that planet has its own
coordinate system and the ship has its
own coordinate system so if we do
everything in World space we're
technically doing it in the higher up um
basically the universe's coordinate
system and things get freaky when you
try to do a gigantic uh you know the
outermost realm TR Trace into to there
instead we should be going to the very
deep coordinate system where we are and
doing our tests in that coordinate
otherwise if you're on the very
outskirts it has to try to figure out
where it's own it just goes Bonkers so
we need to make sure everything that
we're in is in the correct pinate system
so since we're using the eye position of
the player and the direction based on uh
the screen coordinates so basically
wherever my screen is we're projecting
it into the um this the zone
or in this case world we should be
changing both of these to the zone so
first thing we need to do is get the
zone that the player is
in zone we ask the player he has an
entity like hey you give me your zone so
this is the zone that the player is
currently in we want to get his eyes in
zone space so instead of world space we
do Zone space
cool and this direction that gets
projected from the screen to uh the game
is in World space
therefore we need
to translate them into the correct
coordinate
system so let's
translate World space to Zone
space we got to do it right here and
right here
so this will convert my starting camera
position to where I'm pointing from
World space to Zone space so that's
awesome we have a position in zone space
we have a direction in zone space but
now we need to tell physics we're doing
everything into this specific
zone so we'll tell
wh H where is it we
need get physics
grid get we got to tell
physics we are going to be in this
specific um coordinate system using the
position and Direction hopefully we'll
now get a ray Trace hit but when we get
a hit uh unfortunately there's still
some code that's still doing in World
space so we need to translate that hit
position from Zone space back so convert
Zone space to World
space Shazam and let's recode and see
what happens as it recodes I'll explain
it again uh we have pretend this whole
room is uh the universe and this is our
root zone or our world Zone and we have
a planet which is pretty cool and that
has its own Zone which means it could
have its own gravity and basically
everything's in this guy it's a
partitioning system it's pretty cool but
we also have a vehicle it's kind of a
big vehicle but when he gets into uh the
zone of the spaceship he could actually
rotate around and he's basically
affected by the gravity of the ship or
I'm sorry the U the planet instead of
the root Universe system now if you have
a player I don't have here's a little
player we stick him into the ship he's
actually in the zone of uh the ship so
where the player is in the zone of the
ship which had his own gravity so he'll
be pointing up in the planet Zone
rotating around inside of the universe
and what we just did is make sure that
when we do this R Trace we're doing it
relative to the player so if he's in the
ship we're doing the rate Trace in the
zone of the ship if we on the
planet we're doing the ray Trace in
relative to the zone of the planet so I
could place the um the crate in the
planet cuz I'm in the zone then when I
Traverse into the grid of the the ship
I'm now doing everything relative to the
ship so I just finished recoding let's
see what happens we'll pick up this
lovely
box and I am going to run up the
ramp in a peaceful walking
Manner and let's try to place
down come
on hold that I got
stuck all right so let going to try to
place down so I can
place somewhere inside of the
ship somewh place in the ship yeah oh
gosh he's
teleporting well kind of got placed down
but what happened
now what did I
break
I broke
something hit hit
hit
let's skip that crate
again Spa a
crate where my crate
go one thing goes wrong everything goes
wrong why ah there's a crate give me a
crate all right so Reco is just finished
let's try placing down this crate
whoa so place it down anywhere I want in
here in the outside world everything's
fine and dandy let's go up
to the
ship you're going to see it snap right
there cuz it's actually in the
um uh where we oh there we go
it's actually
hitting come here you why aren't you
sideways when one thing breaks it all
breaks
Zone
space
why are you
[Music]
now
Aha and of
course it would help
if our rotation
in this bit was actually in the proper
Zone as
well
so this guy also needs to
be in the
correct
Zone give me
all convert
to give me the
Zone give me the
Zone we are convert Zone space
[Music]
to let's try this real
quick
so one thing breaks everything
breaks
have to do another
fix well I actually discovered another
bug in this thing well discovering the
other one the rotation is all messed up
so I have to fix that one now you get
two bugs for the price of
one
so what happened here folks is um
unfortunately since uh we converted the
race successfully to um the correct Zone
and we had to get the position back into
World space because this is how this bit
of code works but unfortunately the part
that figures out where it should place
it on the rotation uh it was assuming
that the player's rotation was always in
World space but but it's not so we have
to convert that back into World space so
that this could do the correct rotation
up so if I place him
down oh recode why you know
work
yeah where's this
rotation
I managed to crash the entire
[Laughter]
game
yeah two excruciating days where we
didn't think we were going to have a
show
later Jared is it fixed
yet it's been two
days I don't think it's
working
H at least we have a beautiful scenery
all right guys let's test to see if this
fix actually works now we're going to do
the impossible cross the
boundary and try to place a
crate woo so I'm now going to try the
impossible and place a crate down and
see what happens place the crate rotate
a bit and the crate's down h oh we have
successfully crossed the Zone in another
Zone and placed a crate down with minor
rotation so what did I do let's go to
the code so here's the fun uh big old
thing that we were looking at last time
where in this local player choice
component if you hold F you can look
around and pick where you want to place
stuff in a crate and it was doing
everything in World space and the fix
originally was to move the ray cast so
that it was in zone space and everything
else would be kind of in World space
problem was the placement and rotation
got all out of whack so I literally went
through this entire
thing and transformed everything which
should be in zone space or World space
correctly so all of our transforms are
now so when we place this thing down it
does everything in zone space and even
moves this invisible thing into the
correct Zone when appropriate and when
we spawn where is this magical Beauty
when we spawn this holographic thing
that thing you saw when we placed it on
the ground we make sure that it's in the
correct Zone and this placement position
is in the zone PL or rotation um and
spot so now that everything's in its own
space everything appears to be correct
the only issue now is the player kind of
tilts that's a completely different
issue and that will be one for next time
hope you guys enjoyed behind the scenes
of game design and game programming
where one thing you think goes right
ends up going bonkers hope you guys
enjoyed till next time so as you guys
saw we had a fun little bug with the new
feature where uh we have a crate in the
player's hands and you hold F and you
want to look around to place it down it
was doing all of these calculations in
World space but unfortunately when we
have a gigantic planet and a ship um
each of those have their own little
coordinate system inside of it so when
you go inside we have a coordinate
system system and a coordinate system
and a coordinate system and doing all
this Ray casting in the world space
instead of that specific coordinate
system tends to cause some issues so
moving it all into the proper zone
system and transforming everything
relative to the correct coordinate
system resolve the issue and you were
able to place crates from the planet
into the back of the ship hope you guys
enjoyed until next time thank you for
watching so if you want to keep it with
