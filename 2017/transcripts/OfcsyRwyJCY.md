Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hello and welcome to
Around the Verse, our weekly in depth look
at the development of Star Citizen.
I’m Sandi Gardiner and joining me once again
is Game Director, Chris Roberts.
Chris Roberts (CR): Yup, hey Sandi.
Good to be here for another ATV.
SG: It is good to have you back and first
off we wanted to quickly say congratulations
to the team for getting the Alpha 2.6.1 live
and into the hands of all our backers.
CR: Yes, well done to the team!
There were a ton of great updates that have
gone into this patch including new balance
changes to ship, weapons and map updates in
Star Marine, but the biggest accomplishment
was the introduction of regional servers and
the single player mega map.
I know there’s a lot of people in Europe
and Australia that are quite happy that they
have much lower pings than they used to do
playing the game.
SG: Very cool and 2.6.1 wasn’t the only
thing to go live last week.
Our new communication platform Spectrum was
rolled out as well.
You can sign in right now to chat with devs
and fellow players and use the much improved
forums there.
CR: Yes they are very, very cool and along
with the patch release we’ve updated the
production schedule to show how our estimates
lined up with our actual deliveries.
Comparing the two gives some interesting insight
on how we plan our scheduling and obviously
this will be an ongoing thing we’ll be doing
for each oncoming patch.
SG: And last, but not least we have one more
exciting thing we’ll be releasing this week.
Tomorrow we will be launching the concept
sale for the Anvil Hurricane.
CR: yeah.
So this Fighter is going to be a great addition
to the lineup.
It’s one of my favourite designs we have
right now.
It was developed originally for the Second
Tevarin War.
This two seater puts a heavy focus on firepower.
That’s all I’ll say for now because I
don’t want to spoil too much before you
get to the see the cool brochure tomorrow,
it is very cool, but make sure you stick around
for an exclusive look at the Hurricane end
of the show.
SG: First up though let's go now to this week’s
studio update to hear the latest about news
from the Los Angeles team.
[2:08] Studio Update
Eric Kieron Davis(EKD): Hey everyone, I’m
Eric Kieron Davis, Senior Producer here in
Los Angeles.
As many you know the LA office houses several
disciplines working across multiple aspects
of Star Citizen so we wanted to give you a
quick update on the progress we’ve been
making.
One of our biggest teams is the Technical
Content team led by the great Sean Tracy.
Members of this team span across three time
zones and if you were described that team,
the function of that team on a t-shirt it’d
read something like, ‘solving problems you
didn’t know you had in ways you wouldn’t
understand’.
So, to understand some of those solved problems,
here’s some of the things that they did.
To start a portion of the team is working
with Engineering on the new damage system.
As we’ve shown in the past, some ships are
already using the new damage system which
create much more random and organic damage
effects via procedurally generated materials
and an internal skeleton that appears when
metal just melts away.
We’ve also been working on adding the physics
driven destructible behaviour to our item
system 2.0.
Initially this just meant converting the existing
functionality into the new item 2.0 health
and damage system however this work is much
more than just a port.
Networking, persistence and VFX functionality
will be improved and it also extends destructibility
to a broader class of entities including props.
Members of the Tech Content team also work
with Animation to implement the introduction
of facial idles for pilots of all ships.
Now no more death stares from flying over
to save someone from Kareah.
Additionally, Tech Content developed a tool
for marking up zones that are used by the
renderer to hide and show different areas
on a character mesh when layered pieces of
clothing and armour are equipped.
So basically if you character is wearing a
shirt and then you put a jacket on the zone
culling tells a renderer to hide and ignore
any part of the shirt that is out of sight.
One of Tech Content’s many contributions
to this powerful feature was to create a tool
that automatically zones and splits any number
of assets regardless of topology, this allows
us to quickly implement the zone culling feature
onto an already massive database of character
art in a fraction of the time.
So, in a nutshell as opposed to manually the
existing armour and clothing to work with
this new feature, this tool will automate
that process and save us a lot of Dev time.
Now our Tech Design team has been working
on many different elements of the game and
one of their many tools to help everyone visualize
expected gameplay is to develop prototypes
of upcoming features and gameplay.
Recently we’ve had two prototypes come out
of Tech Design, the first was based off Chris’s
initial vision for the Interaction system
which in a nutshell is the interface by which
players will be able to control and manipulate
various objects in the game world such as
ships, control panels, weapons and a whole
lot more.
Once they roughed out that system they work
with Programming and UI to ensure that the
prototype functionality was not only clear
on what we’re trying to achieve but actually
possible.
The second prototype was how the player controls
the properties of items to manage their signals
generated by entities like space ships.
For example, how the power is managed to shields,
weapons and thrusters which allow us to manage
our emissions and engage in a kind of stealthy
gameplay.
The foundational work of this prototype will
allow us to change properties of these items
so that we can determine how upgrading will
be desirable and fixes our previously limited
system which we were unable to balance and
provide a design up a much more direct way
to implement gameplay via simple numerical
values.
They’re also deep in the setup of the Drake
Cutlass Black, Buccaneer and the rework of
the RSI Aurora as well as another ship we
can’t quite discuss yet.
Lastly they’re taking a pass at updating
our ships stats page on the website to bring
all the information about our ships up to
the most current specs.
As part of this change we plan on providing
regular updates about any changes to each
of our ships going forward.
Now, over on the Engineering side the team
has been working on instance properties, which
allow designers to modify any part of an entity
component in editor or ingame.
With this features designers do not have to
create similar entity templates for our game,
they just need to expose some parameters that
the designer can modify inside the editor.
This will save asset storage and really reduce
the number of entity components but at the
same time allow for much more variations.
Obviously with the ultimate aim to create
seamless transitions throughout our entire
universe, the Engineering team is making progress
on object container streaming by changing
some of our core engine code, which will radically
increase the amount of content we can put
in the game all at once without sacrificing
any performance.
For example, we’re currently replacing the
old pre-fab system in the Hangar and Shops
with an object container in the preparation
for this expected streaming.
On the radar front, we’ve added an extra
timer value to the object databank which will
be used to specify how much time an entry
can remain as an echo contact as well as implementing
the meta data component interface which is
an entity component that can be attached to
any entity to make them radar detectable.
We’ve also added an object databank linking
and unlinking feature, so that entities will
inherit databank entries from their parent.
This will allow a player to inherit information
he or she is currently sitting in.
Then we’re also working on new scanner gameplay
tied into the new radar system that build
on the mechanic of revealing more or hidden
information on radar objects.
We’re really excited about this addition
because it will have a lot of potential elements
to scanning another ship and will be instrumental
in the eternal struggle between smugglers
and law enforcement, for example.
Lastly, the Engineering team is working on
lighting state to provide a little more context
when it comes to space stations, ship interiors
and other sorts of man or alien made environments.
We want the lights to be able to have various
altered states to reflect certain situations
like low power or emergency lockdown.
While we currently have a way to accomplish
this using layer switching, it has its downsides
such as requiring duplicate lights for each
state and having no options for transitioning
animations.
We’re therefore developing a new entity
called a light group, that will take control
of these lights that are assigned to it with
it’s own internal state machine, the light
group will be able to modify its ights depending
on the current state.
For example, switching from a normal light
state to an emergency light state and back,
you can think of it as the ultimate light
switch.
Now over on the character side we’ve moved
further down the pipeline on many of our new
outfits.
Specifically in Squadron 42 we have lots of
deck crew who work a variety of jobs and some
of them need to work on the exterior of ships
in the vacuum of space.
This deck crew outfit is coming along nicely
and is firmly in the high poly modeling phase.
Also you’ve seen the explorer space suit
recently in the newsletter and on our previous
updates and it’s moving along nicely as
well.
The team is finalizing texturing and it has
already been sent to rigging which will allow
us to get tested in game in the very near
future.
Last but not least, we’re working very hard
on the heavy armour class for both Marine
and Outlaw.
We now have the 3D concept for the heavy Outlaw
going through rounds of feedback and once
that concept’s approved they’ll move right
on into the high poly modeling phase.
While the heavy Marine is in engine and headed
over to the rigging team and then on to final
implementation.
Well, that wraps us up for the LA studio update,
thank you very much for your support and see
you again soon.
[9:33] Back to Studio
SG: Thanks for the update Eric, I think a
lot of people are going to be excited for
the plans for the ship page now that we’re
better positioned to provide more accurate
stats to everyone.
CR: Yes, more accurate stats is always good.
What got me excited is the design of our player
interaction system for Item 2.0, it has now
gone into production.
It’s going to open up a whole universe of
gameplay possibilities taking our initial
Grabby Hands idea and incorporating it with
the inner thought system has created a ton
of new options for designers to begin exploring.
From looting, to shopping, to hanging out
at the bar, should be a lot of fun.
SG: Very, very cool and speaking of hanging
out, next up we take an in depth look at our
new chat and community platform Spectrum.
So let’s head to Montreal to hear from our
web development partner, Turbulent on the
tech it took to bring this new system online.
[10:24] Behind the Scenes: Spectrum
Benjamin Fardel (BF): Star Citizen is a lot
of things and it’s aiming to be a lot of
things.
It’s a space simulator.
It’s a shooter.
It’s a full blown universe you can play
in first person.
It’s a lot of stuff at the same time.
And a really crucial part in this is the roleplaying
thing that for me is what … what draws me
the most to the project is the fact that people
can get immersed and play however they want,
with any ship they want, any setting setting
they want and explore this whole thing and
choose a career path.
Basically living however they want in that
universe.
So if we wanted to do a communication platform
for that game we need it to have something
that will reduce a lot of the friction that
would happen naturally between the players
and the tools that they would use to communicate.
John Erskine (JE): So when we launched the
crowdfunding campaign in 2012 we started with
a traditional website and traditional forums
and a service called Chatroll.
And these systems worked pretty well for us
in the beginning: they’re very traditional,
they’re things people are comfortable with
and for the size of our community they made
perfect sense for us to do that.
Over time on the platform we’ve replaced,
or we’ve improved, different pieces of these
tools.
For instance we replaced Chatroll - there
was a point where we outgrew Chatroll - we
would have more people in chat than it could
support and it was chaotic.
So we built our own chat system based on XMPP
and that on the service today, that’s still
on the platform today in fact.
We also talked a lot over the last several
years about upgrading our forums to be more
modern forums.
And in fact we’ve talked about a variety
of things like, building our own forum engine,
having orgs … allowing orgs to have their
own forums on our site.
These are all major undertakings because we
have more than 30,000 organisations and so
if we allow every org to have their own forum
that means you now have to support 30,000
different forum instances.
Benoit Beausejour (BB): So we went to Chris
with the plan to build a new forum engine
that we could replicate to all of the orgs
because most forum engines will allow us to
do one instance but we need it to 40,000 instances
… forums.
And so we came to Chris with this plan.
We design a forum engine to be modern, new
ways to see threads with trending, replies
that have notifications , live updates.
It was a very nice concept but it was it was
still just a forum engine.
BF: So we needed to have a platform that would
be part of the project itself.
Part of the game.
BB: I think the key word became that we wanted
this application to be both available both
in and out of game.
To cover for everything that is out of game.
Because that’s a real big part of your gaming
experience today is talking with your friends,
setting up your game parties, organising with
your organisations, calendars and meet ups.
And so we wanted to build a framework that
would allow us to build that into the game.
BF: The organisation system has been around
for awhile now.
It’s been actually three years I think.
And first of all it has an amazing response
ever since it got out.
We saw the number of organisations created
was amazing, but also the amount of involvement
that players were showing with those … just
a simple set of tools that you could create
your own presence for organisation.
It had a homepage that you could define, have
text you could put in and have your own brand
and stuff.
That ... just … a really simple set of tools
and people did amazing things with that.
And now we .. with Spectrum we’ve given
that a whole new set of tools to cultivate
that presence and actually cultivate your
… the spirit of your organisations.
Right now when you play the game you start
on the website.
You have your own inventor and that feeds
into the game.
So that’s one way that it interacts.
But then Spectrum fits in there in that it
is your … your presence as a player in Star
Citizen wherever you are.
Whether you’re playing or not.
That also gets fed by data from the Organisations
System.
So the Organisations System has been out for
years now - I think three years - and people
took to that when it got out because it was
the first time you could actually roleplay
into the universe of the game.
And we were amazed by how many - first of
the number - like how many organisations were
created but also the implication of some players
to … sticking to a role and having their
own identity in their organisations and having
that define who they are in the game even
when they play.
Getting all of those organisations and outlet
to have their own forums and chat systems
was a lot of pressure on use because it mean
that we were not just releasing something
to replace the original forums and chat of
Star Citizen.
We were actually launching, not one, but 30,000
for engines and chats.
And the opportunity for each of them to be
customised whichever way their owners wanted
them to be.
BB: And so when we pitched it to Chris as
a first consideration he literally told us
to think bigger.
That we should expand on that and just try
to fix communication as a whole instead of
just trying to replicate the forum engine.
JE: So Benoit and I continued to brainstorm
and come up with different ideas and found
by looking at a lot of different systems that
are out there like ... Discord is popular.
Reddit’s very popular.
Things like Stack Overflow.
Things like other forum engines.
We decided that we could tackle the challenge
of building our own system that integrates
all of these things.
BB: And we started to design and application
that would be unique to Star Citizen.
That could bridge this gap between the web
experience that you get and in-game experience
that you’re going to get when the game is
fully integrated.
Tyler Tumlinson (TT): One of the cool features
that comes with Spectrum is social tools that
add and improve to the user experience.
An example of that moderation tools that allow
organisations to better manage and organise
their communities.
BB: The team really stepped up but quickly
realised this was going to be a gigantic challenge
and not just a standard development effort
that would require many design cycles, many
UX design cycles, and at the same time technology
innovation to be able to reach … to be able
to ship it in a time that’s respectable.
Edern Talhouet (ET): [French] When we started
thinking about design, we instinctively went
with flat UI.
It made it easier to load, more functional,
and easier to upgrade later.
There’s a lot of functionalities we’re
planning to add to Spectrum so we had to think
forward with a simple and stripped down design.
This allowed to make the most of Spectrum’s
functionalities and with minimum friction
for the users.
BB: And so as we got pretty much done with
the design aspect of the project we realised
not only … how big the scope was but we
realised it was going to be a huge technological
challenge to get there.
And so that’s when we all met up together
and we’re just like “Alright let’s build
this thing!”
And then we kept on trucking from there.
So the first roadblocks that we encountered
was that we didn’t have the technology to
build that and so we really needed to extend
the RSI platform to include a lot of real
time services that were going to be needed
to power lobbies, realtime forums, channels
- and soon voice lobbies - but all of this
needs to be build in a generic way.
But now that we have this technology we were
able to step stone to the next one.
Other types of roadblocks that we encountered
- a giant one - was the technological stack
for the actual application itself.
And so we knew it had to be a web-based application.
Now there are many, many options on what type
of framework we can use to build an app like
that.
And so we set out to do a lot of research
to figure out which stack we were going to
use.
This includes what rendering technology we
were going to use inside the browser, what
kind of communication layer we’re going
to use.
And so we ended up choosing React as a base
platform which is a framework from Facebook
- it’s open source - that’s our baseline
for the application.
We also used the library that we’re big
fans of called Redux that gives us a way to
manage state inside the application that’s
really streamlined.
So we started to move out everything into
React and we built the entire thing with it
and it became a hallmark in the team here
and this was an expertise that we sort of
had internally, but that really needed to
expand on and so a lot of the team members
that joined the spectrum team were, initially
not very proficient in this technology, but
then really learn quickly based on Laurent’s
work in order to really facilitate getting
the rest of the features online.
So we were able to basically silo that up
between developers and so people would focus
on a specific of features, build it out without
interfering with the others and then bring
that into the main line so we could iterate
quickly.
So that was a really big win because building
traditional maps, you know HTML5 apps like
we did in the past.
Like the original RSI platform would not have
scaled to this kind of functionality and state
transition so we’re really happy about that.
So other types of roadblocks we hit was on
the server side.
So there’s a special use case for a web
application when you think of online connections.
So Spectrum is using websocket connections
for everything which is a way for us to get
real time updates on the client and one of
the major roadblocks we hit really early was
the fact that our, let's say you compare the
game to Spectrum, ingame you’re going to
only have one connection per account or per
character right?
So the way the servers manage it is that you’re
connected once.
On Spectrum though you can have multiple connections
and so you can have multiple tabs open.
You can have one tab open in the game, one
tab open in your browser and your phone so
you’re connected in multiple places so we
have all this class of problems that come
from that like which connection is active,
which connection is inactive, are you the
same user, are you disconnected and now when
you add the concept of presence to that, it
becomes fairly complex because you can be
online in the tab, away in another one so
we have to basically brainstorm multiple versions
of our presence system in order to get to
something that’s pretty comfortable which
is: you have user control on certain presence
statuses, but other status are automatically
toggled.
For example online, away, and playing are
automatically toggled by the system across
your connections and so are you also offline?
If all your connections go offline then you’re
offline, but then if you’re reconnected
from your mobile then you’re online and
so there’s this whole differentiation between
online and offline and then presence details
that come in and so our first iteration of
our prototype was very, very simple.
We had a single thread presence system that
was over there, but then we quickly released
when we started having multiple connections
that this wasn’t going to scale so we had
to bring other engineers to build the proper
presence service which also turns out to be
the first contact point that we had with the
game which was really exciting for us because
then we were able to get their presence from
the game whether you’re in menu’s, in
Star Marine, in Arena Commander, In your hangar
into Spectrum.
So you’re online and then you go online
in the game and it changes and that for us
was a super kickass moment because it’s
like, “Wow, now we’re bridging this gap”
and that’s the vision for this application
and that’s the first wall that we’re breaking
down between the game and Spectrum and it’s
not going to be the last and so this whole
roadblock of the presence system was a major
one, but we’re glad we tackled it this way
because now we have a lot of flexibility in
how we display presence and that’s going
to be a core piece of element moving forward.
So the way the way we engage the community
for testing Spectrum was interesting and it’s
something we’re going to redo quite a bit.
We really want to make this a bit different
in this process.
We have the chance of working on a component
of the game which is not directly related
to the story or lore and so I think we can
share a lot more of our development, like
we’ve already been sharing with you guys
the type of technologies that we’re using
and we plan on keeping doing that in the future,
but the way we engage with the community is
that we went to PTU fairly early in the process
back in December and our initial goal was
to go at this frantic pace of releasing a
build every week to the community on PTU and
so that’s what we setup to do in December
and we did that, but not only did we want
to ship builds and build notes which is standard,
but we also wanted to be there with the players
on PTU, talk about Spectrum and you know be
involved in the testing you know because sometimes
you need this personal connection with players
in order to understand what the problem is,
if there’s a design issue or there’s an
actual bug right?
So this frantic pace we kept it up till launch
in February and so we’re really happy about
that because it gave us this proximity with
players that allowed us to change the app
entirely.
Like you can ask any members of the Evocati
group: Spectrum version 0.1 and version 0.3,
what’s the difference?
It’s pretty major because we’ve listened
to feedback quite a bit initially to be able
to fix.
It’s all in small details which is, there’s
broad strokes, but a lot of small details
got adjusted that were a big deal and so we’re
really happy about that proximity and we want
to continue to do that.
Of course on the live servers we can’t go
as fast, but we still plan to do an update
a month, even more if we can, but as long
as there’s no breaking change we’re good,
but we really want to keep that momentum going
so you can see how fast Spectrum is progressing
since we don’t have special hide this feature
thing, so we can talk openly about what’s
coming up.
There’s a lot next for Spectrum, but in
the short to intermediate term we’re reviewing
feedback, we’re looking at what you guys
are telling us about the release.
We know we have lot of things to adjust, like
the launch was pretty hectic, but it was a
good, but now we have technology changes to
make.
In the short term we’re gonna adjust.
I think spend a lot of time on the forum part
of Spectrum to make it reach a little feature
parity with the old forums so we want to spruce
it up a bit.
TT: Additionally we’re reviving the ask
a dev section that you may remember from the
forums.
It allows backers to ask questions to developers
in real time so they can gather more information
about what’s up and coming or specifics
about systems we’ve already announced.
We’re really excited about it because Spectrum
allows us to do this initiative and we have
some new and exciting stuff coming in the
future.
JE: There’s a lot more functionality to
come with respect to presence.
More what we call “Rich Presence” to actually
know to a very detailed level where you are
in game.
That would allow us to do more things around
parties and grouping and locational awareness.
We could have location where chat lobbies,
location where services.
TW: One of my favourite parts about Spectrum
is that it brings a lot of my favourite features
from things like Reddit, Discord, and a few
others and it brings them all to one place
that’s easily accessible from the entire
Star Citizen community.
BB: There’s also a few modifications in
how the sorting works.
As you guys know, Spectrum supports classic
style sorting and you know more Reddit style
sorting and so we want to keep this duality
and give you guys the power to do that within
your orgs, but we want to increase the feature
set on that front so expect a bunch of short
updates to forums moving forums.
Our big ticket items in the what’s next
category is obviously, mobile app.
So we currently support mobile, but we want
to have a real native experience on mobile
so we’re going to be working on mobile ports.
BF: But if you allow yourself to dream much,
much further than that, you can also imagine
stuff like a complete communication system
with voice where you can have…
Let’s imagine you’re in your ship, you’re
landing your ship with a couple of friends,
you actually have two communication channels
that you can switch between.
One that is for people who are actually manning
the ship and having an actual role in the
ship and the other one is like a P.A. system,
blaring information to people who are not
just manning the ship, but also like not the
crew itself, but passenger or boarders and
you could switch between the two during the
game and coordinate with your friends to counter
their attack that’s appearing right now.
JE: Ultimately spectrum will replace our current
forums which are very traditional, functional,
but very traditional forums.
It will replace our XMPP chat and it will
give orgs their own forums to work with as
well.
So we have achieved our initial goal already
with the launch of Spectrum of giving every
org their own private forum to deal with,
having a live chat and having all these modern
functions built in.
BB: If you guys haven’t tried it already,
I invite you guys to come online on Spectrum
and give it a shot.
If you see anybody from Turbulent, feel free
to reach out to them and talk to them about
Spectrum.
Now don’t flood them, but you can ask questions.
We have this policy that we want to be super
open about this development and so any questions
you have or ideas that you have, bring them
to us and we’ll try to do what we can with
it.
[28:32] Back to Studio
CR: Seeing where Spectrum’s headed you can
really see how much it’s going to bring
to the game.
What we have right now is just the beginning.
We’ll be adding much more functionality
like bringing across the full organisation
setup to Spectrum.
Wider variety of thread styles, adding VOIP,
integrating you closer to the games so you
can see not only which of your friends are
online, but where and what they are doing,
because actually put that option on, you’ve
got to respect your privacy.
Going from chatting online to connecting with
your friends in game on the same platform
is going to redefine how players connect within
Star Citizen and each other so I’m really
excited to see by what it’s going to bring
SG: I am too because staying connected with
all of you is very important to us and it’s
a big reason why we create such a wide variety
of behind the scenes content every week.
Outro
That’s it for this episode of ATV.
We’d like to thank all of our subscribers
for giving us this level of community involvement.
CR: Yes thank you very much for all of that.
Even though we say this every week, it stays
just as a true, we would not be able to build
a game as wonderfully complex and immersive
as Star Citizen if it was not for our community
of backers, thank you very much.
SG: Thank you very much and we would like
to invite all of you to join us tomorrow at
12 Pacific for the latest Star Citizen Happy
Hour stream for some live gameplay as well
as something very special.
CR: Yeah this week's guest will be Character
Art Director, Josh Herman who will be creating
a new creature concept live on the stream.
So good luck to him for that, and while taking
suggestions from chat.
It’s not something you’re going want to
miss.
SG: Coming up now as promised is the exclusive
premier of the brand new Anvil Hurricane going
on sale tomorrow.
CR: Yeah so take a look and we’ll see you.
Both: Around
the Verse.
