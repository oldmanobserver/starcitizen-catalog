## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm for Stefan happy to be
here with you sandy it's good to have
you here to forest today we take an
in-depth look at the detail that goes
into the surface outpost you'll be
exploring in 3.0 from adding specific
branding to adjusting the amount of wear
and tear from the weather creating these
outposts is far more complex than you
might think but first last week on
burned down we showed you some of the
bugs and blockers currently affecting
the 3.0 release this included an issue
where players would spawn the wrong way
in port olisar and immediately fall
through the station's geometry Oh
to see what issues have been found and
fixed since then let's take a look at
this week's burned down welcome to burn
down our weekly show dedicated to
reviewing progress on issues blocking
the release of star citizen alpha 3.0 in
our week ending report at Roberts space
industries calm /schedule - report last
Friday we were at 83 total issues which
were identified as 12 blockers forty
three criticals 23 hides five moderates
and no trivial x' with 32 new must fix
issues created but let's see how this
week is progressing the 3.0 release is
the first time that we're going to offer
players real persistence it also means
that we're finally really leveraging a
lot of technology that we've been
building towards for a long time it
means we have to be prepared to do a lot
of interesting bug fixings that it's
hard to track down
you know it's hard to identify where
these are coming from in order to get an
idea of how things are up to the tree
but over and specifically often a
certain email to QA leads earlier today
but if you guys can do a 3.0 smoke test
today then we can have results of that
over the weekend thing that's been
really getting through this week and the
last couple weeks really has been
getting the shopkeeper in order the
shopkeeper animations particularly
we have these shoots these awesome
shoots with a couple different actors
that were something to get in and behind
the counter and so right now like the
counters are where the characters are
doing all this and we have a bunch of
different counters and a bunch of
different characters doing different
things at them and so I'm going in and I
put it in and I put it all the stuff
onto one counter and then they all use
it a different way than that like I
expected and then you know like right
now we're having a place to deliver a
box when you need to and I got it out
when I got it working I was so happy and
then I played it and then I realized
that the guys leaning right with a box
was going to be delivered and so I walk
up and just like stuff it in this face
it's something that you think you have
figured out and then you see it in and
you realize though I didn't have this
figured out I had really should have
probably thought about this harder
before and coordinating with the UK and
the design team over here to go through
and just get get the animations in and
get the face team to have this sync so
this is all now one-to-one so she's
actually playing face animations and
then getting all of that to work in
sumption so that if you go in as a
player not only we should be able to do
this but she'll be able to intelligently
like you know turn and look and be like
hey how's it going you know I mean this
right here I mean this is the result of
thousands of hours of in a multiple you
know and you know it's it's not one
person I mean there's you know there's
your snack you know there's you know
7080 a hundred people that were involved
in trying to get this a bit at all
clicks I think that right now we have to
ensure that we first apply today and I
think that we need to keep the momentum
on the European time zone so we can tell
by the girl we're totally done yet and
then that way when the US times are
going how they have the Momentum's
switchover West case by tomorrow morning
we have to be in a position where you
walk in tomorrow morning and you're like
well you should - at least raking end of
UK days that would be arguably the best
year I'm working on usable
those are objects that NPCs use in the
game so the frustrating thing about this
is that quite a few of those things used
to work before but are now broken again
so in this video for example we have an
NPC who grabs a cup and for some reason
it just is in his hands and then he puts
it down and he pushed himself out of the
booth with with this cup so after a lot
of research we found out that this is
because the cup actually has collision
and the table also is collision and
during this interaction they are not
supposed to collide with each other
because they are both part of the same
process namely in drinking in this case
but for some reason they do so the
embassy puts it down pushes himself out
of the booth which then messes up
everything that follows including
heavily clipping through the booth to be
precise though we haven't entirely
figured out is really an animation issue
so the investigation still needs to
happen string givers there's a lot of
challenges because we've got a very
cinematic experience that we're trying
to use with the same feather blending
tech for everything else and so we've
got some challenges that the other wild
lines and stuff doesn't really have to
deal with so a car will finish lines in
like different positions so he'll he'll
be forward to kind of you know talk to
the player a little more discreetly year
and he'll finish his line there whereas
a lot of the other wild lines they kind
of can say they're their lines from any
positions so you know whether they're
wiping a counter or standing at a
counter just leaning on it or leaning up
against the wall they can all say hello
goodbye whatever but Eckhart's you
really want to feel that emotion that
he's trying to convey and so reusing the
same tech has been challenging in that
sense and the other thing that we were
able to do is look at getting to fix on
the car issues that we've been seeing
those combination of designing the AI
team on their sprints and making sure
that each node still actually present so
he was missing from the bill at that
point and that got fixed as well so to
fix that one on which is cool so I'm
working on right now is item
highlighting its shops we've been
updating the way you interact with shop
items have a smooth
the shopping experience to use our
existing interaction system instead of
our AR data and so if you take a look
here when you look at a weapon on the
rack or sort or whatever it'll highlight
that weapon so you know you can buy it
but if you pay extra close attention
you'll see things like the magazine or
sometimes the scope or other bits of the
gun are not being highlighted and that's
because things that we have attached to
these shopping items will not get the
highlighting just the main item so I'm
going through and making it check all
the attached items so everything gets
highlighted so you don't get weird
situations like this so how is it the
shovelry cask stuff is that and I didn't
go particularly well I mean we saw you
sell pretty much everything because the
thing about shopping the key is because
they're all going to be the same across
the board so once you see all this all
you've seen everything
zooming it gets through everything and
unfortunately most of things don't work
and you are is not fully established so
the primary focus of it is just where's
the UI yeah yeah and so it's not very
similar towards last time so we're
currently having some problems with
right now is doors across a bunch of
different ships particularly caterpillar
as well as the constellation you see the
constellation the doors seem to be
fleeing they don't want to stay inside
the constellation at the moment so we've
been chasing down exactly why they are
fleeing the nest and leaving everything
within the constellation in kind of a
rough state because of that some people
don't understand exactly how complicated
our doors are they're not just a simple
open and closed because they also do
things like hold the environment in and
the you know the atmosphere for your
ship as well as represent certain areas
of the physics grid we're consolidating
all of our door texts of all be variants
of the same system one of the things
that I'm doing is that a there has been
some mismatch in least reported I
haven't found it yet with some mismatch
in the actual assets being used possibly
as a result of that switch
so I'm going through and cleaning that
stuff up now making sure that everything
is are the same naming conventions
everything uses the same effects or
sounds as they're supposed to or hooks
those into the proper bones because all
of our doors that bring something in
with the load-out will have the same
expectations of what those attached
points are going to be now we have had
some interesting bugs I guess I think
because you know when we when Glynn
project first staff did a lot of this
stuff was kind of more of a pipe dream
and we didn't necessarily have the tech
to do it now we've got the tech to do it
there's you realize that those it
doesn't really matter if something is a
centimeter off or it doesn't really
matter if something's not quite right it
is now really really important it's been
really really good kind of therapeutic
for us to kind of go back there actually
do you know what looked at this and it's
not quite right but we know how we need
to fix this now and it's I think it's
been a good chance for us to be much
stricter with our our processes much
stricter with our naming conventions and
our metrics in QA we've been amongst the
first wave of guinea pigs for the
rollout of coffee world 3 internally
it's really benefit others in QA and it
will benefit everyone else too
I've got on my screen copy all three
which is our internal patch a tool and
right now I'm just going to be
incrementing a 3.0 build to the next
version so as it goes through it's
picking up on what data we do already
have from our previous run and it skips
over anything it doesn't need to do and
just as the downloads it does so
previously on that last run which went a
little bit wrong our loose files took a
while and already here we have an
updated 3.0 build the copy builds 3
application itself is really just the
tip of the iceberg we've got many people
working on lots of different moving
parts to get this to actually worked
from the build guys over in Austin
through to engineering in Frankfort who
have actually developed the app sure
that's the copy bill 3 is based upon
so really this week's been tying up all
the loose ends had a few issues the last
minute realizing that we could launch
because we needed some changes making to
the build system however that's all got
resolved and we launched hopefully
successfully today so quantum drive
involved two major things getting the
ship across the system wherever we're
going at you know fractions the speedo
light and ensuring they got there safely
we've been getting the ships there no
problem getting there safely has been
the issue if two people want to jump at
the same point there were chances of
them colliding asteroids getting in the
way
stuff like that so our biggest issue is
now has been dealing with the potential
collisions along the way and preventing
that so detecting at you know a tenth or
2/10 the speed of light am I about to
hit something and stopping soon enough
we've had several several issues where
people would jump to the same point and
arrive on top of each other and just
explode the big one we had for a while
was people would jump to a planet or
whatever and end up inside the star and
this there and you would just see a
glowing circle I've got what's going on
look around oh I am now the star of the
system now we're still knocking more out
than coming in and at the time we're
filming this we resolved 54 with 46
being added to our must fix list and
we're currently sitting at 88 issues
blocking his first release well across
all of our internal branches we've
checked in over two thousand fifty two
updates this week alone the next time
our public schedule gets updated you can
see even more progress as we work to
keep you as up-to-date as we are
internally also we've officially moved
our development team over to the 3.0
branch which is another great milestone
for us to further triage issues coming
in and get us ever closer to our first
release to non vig testers our
optimizations and polish are making for
better testing allowing us to move
quicker into regression and bug
identification so come back next week to
see the progress we're making here on
burn down just a reminder that there
won't be an atv next week while we're at
Gamescom in the meantime you can check
out the production schedule on our
website to track the progress of 3.0 and
speaking of 3.0 one of the features
we've showcased in the upcoming release
is the ability to visit of
of surface outposts scattered across
crusaders moons these outposts will be
places for you to explore do missions
and cross paths with other players now
take a look at the team responsible for
making these outposts interesting and
connected to the surrounding environment
so the last update we kind of showed you
what the outpost archetype is the main
shake language how it sat on the surface
whereas now we're going to go a little
bit deeper into the branding and the
integration and the detailing that we're
going to put into the interiors so we're
given a brief and it will be quite light
and in terms of narrative and they'll
say something like ol re re is a
high-tech hydroponics lab and that grows
cutting-edge by engines of plants and
they used in medicine so then they'll
also say what the field will be will be
high clean organized scientific nice
place to work and I just convey that in
a visual method so this isn't just a
process that can just be done in an
instant it's a progression thing so I'll
do like a first iteration and that'll
probably just involve maybe putting down
the selection of props and then all them
pass that on to my leader and our
director and they will review it and
they will say okay maybe the field here
isn't quite what we need we need
something maybe a little more sterile or
something a little more cleaner say for
example something like the focused on we
need something a bit more sinister
looking so it's a process of layering
the dressing and then building up an
authentic atmosphere so we go from that
initial point and then we'll get to the
end where we're kind of happy with it
and we feel like when you walk in in the
player goes wow this is cool
traditional what you do is you concept
out your vest a shot and kind of
describe where their location is whereas
now with the tools we have it's actually
more natural more organic to just have a
little Scout around that way you kind of
get natural happy accidents so for
example you might find a location where
the
is a nice kind of rich line and then
there's maybe a gas chain just peeking
over the horizon and then that's when we
stop saying this will be a good location
you also get that second element of
believability were you know rather than
putting down an arbitrary location it's
what people actually build there you
know but this way we can almost validate
the location you know is it believable
would people build there and then that's
when we can start establishing our
compositions I found a lot of times
where I decided on a place for an
outpost and I've dropped a point down
and then I fly maybe a mile to the left
nothing oh this is a much better place
to pull that outpost delete the old one
move my type of point drop it down there
it's the process of 30 seconds so you
know it is very quick to iterate on I do
basically fly around the moon and think
this is much better oh you know the gas
giant hanging in the sky just here
really looks good so let's put an
outpost here and I tend to move things
around quite a lot so secondly about
integration and believability it comes
to the surface in the weathering so when
you see an outpost you can you should
see an indication about how long he's
been in that landscape the type of
climate that's being happening there and
thirdly the type of people that live in
this location so these three factors go
a long way for describing you know the
visual style of this location so one of
these elements is slightly off they
don't kind of break that immersive
element so it's something we always pay
attention to then we integrate these
outposts onto the planet and basically
that just means how it fits in if it's a
sandy planet you want the outpost and
have some of that
to help you embed it and it doesn't look
like it's floating on this planet and
it's nothing to do the environment you
know see it's an environment and it will
take part of that on we had several
levels of how we integrate our outpost
onto a planet's surface we've got the
outpost itself the exterior walls and
the ramps and stairs they have a blend
map which takes on some of the texture
information from the outpost some of
that stone procedurally so by the base
of the outpost
actually uses a tech to blend the planet
surface into the texture of like the
stilts and the ramps and then we have
our actual walls having their own blend
map so if it's the sandy one it will
blend sand will come in with the gaps
and the crevices and then the ice you
want to go the same kind of thing ice
will build up like Frost it's like in a
jungle environment or more like life
like biome then you might get moss or
vines or something like that so that's
the sort of blending we do on there and
then we do the decals themselves so
that's like projected decals of of
similar things but we can do a bit more
localized kind of build up so streaks of
coming down the outpost and build up on
the roof of the outpost if there's been
a sandstorm then it's blown over the top
and then we can show that we can
actually control the amount of built-up
itself so using the blend Maps we can
see how new this outpost is it is it
sort of quite recent it might only have
patches of dirt around or has this
outpost been on there for many many
years and it's sort of maybe it's
abandoned and it's got stuff coming
inside as well as it's covered like you
imagine like an Arctic base has been
there for many years it would be covered
in and just frost and ice and then you
only get those hints of what the
underlying wall might be so on the
interiors we've been defining what these
spaces that actually are so rather than
just having these generic volumes
we've been defining what the architects
are so you know if you're going into an
engineering space or medical or
habitation things like that secondly
it's about the brand the who who owns
this place so we usually get a good
brief from the law team and that's our
starting point there are different
corporations that we have for the
outpost so for example we have a re
corporation and Shubin interstellar
corporation and it's slight differences
between these two and so the re re
corporation is probably a better place
to work and it's more pleasurable for
employees and
and they focus more on sore alpaca
culture the Shubin on the other hand is
maybe slightly more impressive is it's
not was probably a pleasant place to
work in order to do the branding of the
outposts we first get the information
from the writers the law and the
narrative so what these up lists are
what company owns them if they are a
company or independent and what's the
sort of general theme and narrative of
that company and how how it looks and
how its dressed and things like that so
for example if it's Shubin
it would be very corporate it's a really
big corporation it's kind of sterile
they don't necessarily treat their
workers badly but they're sort of like
just their workers and there's not a lot
of character there something like VR is
still corporate but it's a little bit
more considered like a nicer place to
work so you should see that in the in
the way it's dressed and even layout and
things like that and then you've got
like the more rundown corporations like
art Corp feel more dirty they really
don't treat their workers very well and
then you have the independent company so
they wouldn't be as dirty necessarily
but they wouldn't be as tidy as a
corporation to have a bit more character
because that they're kind of like a home
from home so someone saved up a bit of
money managed to sort of buy a mining
machine and started their own little
little independent so there'd be more
character it might be a bit Messier but
they've kind of be living there as well
that's kind of interesting too that law
and stuff which should be shown in the
dressing so you should be able to see
what kind of company is just by that but
then we've obviously got the actual
branding like the logos the and the
color scheme so we go about that by
instead of doing all this stuff spoke
Lee with materials we feed in our colors
my primary secondary tertiary colors and
any kind of logo colors and practical
stuff as well into dataforge which is
just a library of date
really and then that feeds back into the
material so we don't manually make like
lots of different materials of different
colors we just put in our RGB values and
then those colors get fed in so whoever
owns say this mining station if it's
Shubin then it will tie in to that color
scheme and take that so it's a nicer way
than having to manually do everything
and then we've got the logos themselves
so we have our we have like an atlas of
logos and idents and lines and fonts and
things like that and then they get fed
in as well so if Shubin owns this then
it takes this whole set of materials and
then if we aree owns it and takes that
set of materials and if it's an
independent maybe it doesn't even have a
logo and we try not to like just plaster
logos everywhere we want to be a bit
more subtle you'd obviously sexy some
but depends on the corporation but you
know we don't want to see like rere rere
everywhere you look so some corridors
might just have like a certain colored
line that they help you link that to the
to the company and there might be some
not necessarily logos but just symbols
and things started around again just
reinforcing that with that brand so
that's that's how that's done and and
it's it's great that it's all procedural
so we can just drop one down say okay
this is this one is start core it
automatically I mean there's a lot of
setup it will take the color scheme and
the logos format it becomes an
incredibly complex job when you have to
consider so much about where the surface
of the planet works and these
environments aren't just a static level
that is going to look the same every
time you go back to it they'll be in a
constantly evolving kind of spinning
planet that eventually is going to be
orbiting the Sun in a way that makes
sense it's a lot to sort of think about
so you have to consider things like
vistas and lighting are going to change
and you can't as an environment artists
you can't pick a perfect place to put an
outpost and know that it's going to
always look like that so we have to make
sure that we're working towards
environments that look good in many
different scenarios because as the moon
rotates it's going to go from day to
night so we have
make sure that it looks good at night
and day but it's the same outpost so
there's a lot of systems talking to one
another there it's a complex task if we
think about the eventual purpose of
making this entire process at least semi
automated we can't maintain individual
outposts so we could make an outpost by
hand and export it to a level that's an
easy job but if you think about having
to make a thousand outpaced by hand and
exposing each one of those to the level
that's a thousand outposts we have to
maintain if we go back down the chain
all the way to that initial initial
geometry prefab if there's something
breaks in an outpost over here then all
we have to fix is one prefab over here
whereas if something broke in an outpost
that was custom we wouldn't be able to
fix it across all the other outposts at
the same time it would only ever be
fixed in that custom outpost so in a
procedural system you only ever dealing
with pieces but you fix one of those
pieces you fix all the pieces in every
instance of that outpost that is around
so it may be complex now in terms of
initial setup but once the pipeline
tools come in it should be a lot easier
to maintain than if we were making a
thousand custom outposts yeah so that's
the reason really
its initial complexity and initial sort
of beating your head against the wall of
trying to figure out the system but once
that system is in place and once the
tools are in place the end result is
quick and easy to get and it also is a
lot easier to maintain so in terms of
how I use the editor I'll be given like
a set of brushes probably props guys and
I'll also get requests for other props
because when I construct seams and it'll
probably go with my art direct and he'll
say look you know we need something more
on the ceiling and so lately I've been
making a lot of ceiling pieces and these
could be for something the in the labs
they needed something more technical
looking so what I've done not creating
more ceiling vents positions for lights
particularly so I work quite heavily
with
lighting artists and he'll say only you
know some sort of five degree angles in
order to put more lights onto it to
illuminate areas of the room which if it
was just a flat ceiling would be quite
difficult to do so giving him these
options he can do his job more
effectively we work with pretty bad as
well and these are usually
pre-constructed brushes use these can
have things I like to hear and sound
effects and stuff like that
so when I put them down the control
ready to go and gives a more immediate
sort of look as to what we require so
because we've got all these systems
talking to one another we have a lot of
complexity in the way these things are
built and just as an example the
outposts at the moment in a traditional
game you would probably put all your
geometry together light it in an editor
and export that level and it will go
into the game quite a two-step process
for the outposts we start with a
geometry we put those into a geometry
prefab a collection of geometry prefabs
goes into a building piece prefab those
building pieces then go into final
building eg an outpost those outposts go
into an object container that gets put
into an outpost cluster preset that
preset gets spawned on the moon's the
moon with its preset gets put into
another object container our object
container goes into the solar system and
the solar system gets exported to the
game so there's a multi-link chain of
stuff that we have to maintain and
manage and all this is reliant on naming
conventions and file structures so we're
working really hard at the moment
basically the tech artist who wrote it
Alex who you've already talked to tried
it himself and this is the system he
wrote he could have managed it it was
too complicated so we are working very
hard at the moment to basically take all
that middle section out completely and
automate it so that the artists will
only ever be involved with that initial
start and all the way through to the
preset creation and putting the preset
onto the moon
or the middle bit with the multiple
prefabs and presets and object
containers is all going away and should
be completely automated because asking
an artist to maintain that level of
complexity while at the same time being
creative is an impossible request so our
tools guides and our tech artists are
working very hard to make that as
streamlined as possible but it is
becoming more and more complex as we go
along it relies on others basically
building a rule set in a set of
automation that makes it completely
invisible to an artist and an end user
because otherwise people are going to go
insane what we're looking to do is have
the idea of you have a quite a vast
landscape and the player kind of locates
one of these outposts they should start
thinking about how long has it been
there who owns it and things like that
and what we're looking to do is layer
that narrative from the outside to the
inside or so all the way down to how the
food is arranged on the interior across
from the outside to the interior space
the play should start getting those
notes of the narrative all the way
through and I think in contrast to these
barren landscapes to these pockets of
quite intense detail it's a quite a nice
contrast so now we're getting a really
good idea of how it feels for the play
to explore and kind of Traverse around
these locations so continue to polish
but continue to refine and just get that
experience to a very high standard so
we're looking forward to the next
release and then get out to the public
and get people exploring
[Music]
as you saw these surface outposts are
our next step forward in environmental
storytelling
that's right there'll be narrative clues
about who owns the outpost how long it's
been there and who's lived inside be
sure to keep an eye out for those
details when paying them a visit and
that's it for today's show thanks to our
subscribers for supporting all of our
shows August issue of jump point will be
released tomorrow so be sure to check it
out and finally a big thank you to all
of our backers your continued support of
this project is what makes it all
possible

the 25th at 7:00 UTC to catch our
Gamescom presentation and until then we
will see you around the earth
