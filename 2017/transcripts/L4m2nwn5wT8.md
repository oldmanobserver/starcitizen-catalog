## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizens ongoing development I'm Chris
Roberts and I'm Aaron Roberts and
together we're Robert
Square anyway uh I'm out in La work with
Chris and the team on the upcoming 3.0
release um Squadron 42 and Beyond yeah
and it's nice to have you out here
hosting ATV with me uh we've got a lot
of cool stuff planned uh going forward
for 3-0 and Beyond and making sure the
entire production team is on the same
page as essential yeah absolutely
tracking the progress of all the new
features and assets we have planned is
an absolutely massive task yes you know
it definitely is uh and there is a lot
of Technology coming online soon that
we're excited about uh one of those is
serialized variables which is the
subject of our featurette today and
while it may sound like high school
algebra it's actually a critical system
that's a core element of what we call
Star Network and but first before all
that let's go to talk to Eric Karen
Davis right here in Los Angeles for a
studio update hey everyone welcome back
to Los Angeles I'm senior producer Eric
Karen Davis back with our monthly Studio
update since I last saw you we've been
focused on closing out final features
and tasks for SC Alpha 3.0 and Squadron
42 part of this month I visited our
Frankfurt and wils offices and worked
closely with their teams for variety of
reasons and now I'm glad to be back home
to give you this update our narrative
team has been quite jam-packed this
month as well with item 2.0 coming
online they have been knocking out a
massive amount of component descriptions
needed for the 3.0 release everything
from coolers to Shield generators to
Quantum drives the team has been also
working on NPC voice packs for 3.0 as
they wrote and recorded roughly 2800
lines for generic NPCs to really liven
up the world speaking of massive amounts
of dialogue lines one of the challenges
in dealing with the universe of this
scale is keeping track of the various
ious characters and lines that the
player will encounter to keep track of
all this the team has created a first
pass at the persistent Universe
character tracking sheet to provide a
single resource for reference of lines
file names for departments like audio
animation facial capture and performance
capture and overall status and priority
for the massive amounts of dialogue for
NBC's Mission givers and much more once
this is completed it will help us
immensely as we move through the
integration of new Mission givers and
NPCs in the future and lastly the team
has been in the process of walking
through the locations and writing up
documentation of what we'd like to see
as far as props posters signs branding
and setd addressing to really make much
more immersive environmental
storytelling also as part of the
upcoming 3.0 release we're very excited
about introducing cargo's mechanic and
to ensure your ship is technically
equipped we've wrapped up developing the
cargo grids to provide the visual
element of transporting Commodities like
minerals scrap and food the number of
Commodities you'll have will manifest as
stacks of CR crates located within the
ship's cargo hold Limited in capacity by
the dimensions of the grid your ship can
use you'll be able to park vehicles and
other loose items into the cargo hold as
well but just beware that it will limit
the amount of grid space you'll have
available for bought or scavenge
Commodities code is wrapped up on the
feature welld designed has now
implemented the new cargo grids into all
the ships that can carry cargo so you'll
be hauling to your heart's content in no
time engineering has also just finished
up implementing the solar system content
or what we've been calling object
containers into a hierarchy to ensure
that outposts on a moon or Planet as
well as space stations in near orbit are
all in the correct planetary Grid at all
times so for instance grimhex is now
located inside the grid of the Moon
yella for the time being and then
speaking of the all powerful object
containers we've also just been provided
the much needed object container editing
when creating a gameplay level we build
that level with a combination of assets
and object containers originally object
containers had to be built in a
dedicated object container level which
unfortunately made the contents of the
object container only editable in the
actual object container level are you
confused yet in other words when
designers are building levels with
object containers but want to modify the
contents of that object container the
only way to do that is to exit the
current level open the object container
level do some tuning save export and
leave then they'd have to move back into
the level what the team has done now
allows the designer to edit the contents
of an object container save and Export
all while inside the level this creates
a much better experience for our design
team and it's really going to save tons
of time now as a general approach in
game development we always try to make
something once and make it perfect but
since reality never meets expectations
we are always looking for ways to reduce
the time needed in what we call the
discovery phase of a problem one of the
hardest parts about getting a code bug
is finding out what is causing it and
where it's located so establishing tools
and processes to reduce that time not
only helps get to the speed resolution
but also gets our talented programming
team back to that feature we're also
excited to develop So to that end we've
reworked the handling of vehicle
internal damage states to significantly
easier to set up now and debug interior
damage States will be changed based on
the cumulative health of a ship formerly
It Was Written in flow graph but now it
has been integrated into the vehicle
component so that it can be used in a
variety of places this new debug and
setup process should do just that help
us find the problem quickly solve it
fast and get back to feature Dev time
now on ifcs we've now moved the entire
intelligent flight control system of our
ship's update process to batch update
because ifcs is very isolated from the
physics engine taking in values like
velocity Mass center of mass Etc and
outputting one linear and one angular
impulse there's no reason ifcs needs to
be updated in lock step with the physics
thread this change will be much more
efficient El eliminating a major
bottleneck and hopefully allowing a
larger number of simultaneous players on
a server we've talked about also making
progress on this for a little bit now
and we've now completed the new Quantum
Drive 2.0 we've removed the old code
from the previous Quantum drive system
that controlled things like V effects
and sound effects playback as well as
object obstruction detection and
Alignment code we've also moved the
targeting of a Quantum point to the
Target selector on a ship so that drive
now only cares about the travel Point
itself this reduces complexity of the
drive code and should make it run
smoother we're doing some bug fixing as
well as some features that attach to the
Quantum Drive such as closing all
external doors when doing a jump to help
prevent accidents by jumping out of a
ship traveling at high fractions in the
speed of light this should all result in
a smoother working Quantum Drive that is
ready for design and art to really start
tweaking and implementing on all the
ships it's also ready for UI to start
creating a much more realistic feel for
how such an event should be handled in
game as well as a few other features
like the star map now over on the LA
ship front the RSI Aurora has gone
through a final art check this week All
That Remains are any incoming bugs while
going through desig implementation
animation updating sound effects and V
effects Etc with this ship and we've
also established up to 14 different
skins for the designers to utilize as
well the Anvil Terin is finalizing its
gray box phase which means it's setting
up the exterior hierarchy polishing
proxies and baked and migrated
animations for the interior we've
currently polishing the geometry in the
cockpit and the habitation and now
moving into final art we've just handed
the Terin over to Tech design for their
gray box set up on the ship as
well

also now that the conversion for ships
to item 2.0 is underway it's made sense
to update our ship stats page on the
website and we're really excited to
finally be able to get to the up to the
minute stats for all of our ships for
all of you met out there the design has
now been finalized icons finished and
refined meaning and everything's being
updated on the web as we speak they're
being implemented on the RSI website
with more details to come in the very
near future now Tech Arts roles tends to
increase the closer you get to a major
release and as performance begins to
take priority over feature and asset
development using a plethora of internal
tools Tech art has been reviewing the
release to identify code and content
fixes that would dramatically improve
performance one in particular is called
status scope which PL plots graphs from
data logged on a perf frame basis and
more generally it's the system that
produces and manages that data in
essence it provides a way of recording
values such as FPS number of draw calls
Etc from Star Citizen and showing how
they change over the course of a
playthrough this really helps our
development team find ways to improve
performance by looking for frame time
offenders now Tech animation improved
the animation format that animations are
saved as and then reloaded into a scene
in our worst case scenario a scene could
take up to 50 minutes to load into Maya
due to the amount of characters and
length of the scene but with this
Improvement the worst load time has been
dramatically reduced by over 82% meaning
cinematics won't be waiting long to make
quick iteration and over on the skinning
front a female transfer mesh has been
created and the male transfer mesh has
been massively updated now these
transfer meshes are used in conjunction
with all of our skinning tools to
automate basic skinning of all of our
new characters Tech animators can now
spend time perfecting The Waiting of a
mesh allowing for a higher quality and a
more accurate deformation in less
time on many of our heads we've run into
an issue where the eyelids had some
vertex normal issues which led to eyes
looking pretty odd our Tech art team has
now identified the issue and because the
vertices of the eyelids were so close
together the normal would get flipped
but only on a few verts so this was now
been fixed and characters can now sleep
with ease and speaking of characters the
team here has been knocking out
countless costumes for squadron 42 and
Star Citizen currently in production
another female character is finishing up
her in-game asset and then will be sent
over to texturing and rigging along with
our OMC undersuits that have all
finished up in-game modeling and they're
heading on over to texturing the team
also has several other levski specific
characters the civilians and the miners
which are currently being textured then
we'll head over to rigging and
implementation into their final resting
place in game on the great planet of
Delmar and now another exciting news now
that we're in a modular armor system
we're reworking some of our Legacy uee
and pirate armors to bring them up to
the quality of our current assets this
will allow them to be swappable with all
those assets we've officially started
High Poly on some of your favorites now
we'll be moving on to the in-game
modeling and texturing path rework and
speaking of customization along with the
new eye options we'll have a multitude
of styles of hair coming in the upcoming
releases starting with a select group
for 3.0 these are in various states of
production and heading toward the final
finish line we'll have a select group
ready for the initial release and we
can't wait to cover up those hairless
heads and finally we have more finished
rigged and Implement character starting
with the male Marine BDU which will make
its appearance in several places
including the bridge of the Idris The
Male Deb crew can now safely Eva outside
the ship in the vacuum of space when
doing his work and lastly the female
light armor has finished up her
implementation pass along with the
female explor flight suit which will
support her in the far reaches of the
game
[Music]
Galaxy well that's about it and wraps us
up here in Los Angeles as always thank
you for allowing us to create this game
we've always dreamed about and we look
forward to giving you more updates in
the near future have a fantastic rest of
the week we'll see you back in Los
Angeles in no
time so it'll be nice to see people
hauling something other than big Benny's
vending machine and unsuspecting NPCs uh
as great as all those videos were the
team has worked hard to give you a
proper mechanic for the 30 release yeah
cargo is just one of the many important
features we're currently working on a
lot of them like cargo and say deric
ships will be easy to see While others
like serialized variables aren't as
visible but are just as critical to the
game yeah no they're absolutely
definitely as critical to the game
because when you're attempting to build
a game as large and complex as star syi
it's essential to come up with a new way
to streamline the data being transferred
between the server and the clients and
so here to explain exactly how
serialized variables will improve our
networking capabilities and of course
most importantly your star CZ and
experience let's hear from lead Network
programmer Clive
Johnson my name is Clive Johnson I work
for Foundry 42 UK where I'm the lead
Network programmer at working on Star
Citizen today we're going to talk a
little bit about serialized variables so
what are serialized
variables well they're not really
something that you can see in the game
and ideally if everything's working the
way it should then they're not something
that you really ever need to think about
but they are the answer to a question uh
which I think is quite important and
that's how do you network a game like
Star Citizen one of the first times I
asked myself that question was shortly
after I joined the company and I think
my first reaction was one of sheer
Terror you know tears panic and once it
kind of calm down and the tears had
stopped you do what any engineer is
going to do when faced with a impossible
problem you try and break it down into
smaller impossible problems when trying
to answer the question how we Network
star seon one of the first things we've
got to think about is exactly who's
going to do the work who's going to
network everything we have in the game
now star citiz itself is made up of
thousands of different elements and some
of these are visible like planets and
ships and players and coffee cups and
others you don't see like missions or
the logic assigning out landing pads
each of these elements is really a
different type of
entity and each type might be used
thousands of times throughout the game
but all the types behave in specific
ways or have certain uses and that has
to be implemented in the code and most
of them need to work in both single
player Squadron 42 a multiplayer the
Star Citizen in other words most of them
have to be networked so who's going to
do the work well currently we've got
about 60 Engineers C in different parts
of the game but we have only six Network
programmers half of these work in Austin
on backend services and that includes
you know our core online services such
as matchmaking and friends and player
authentication the other half is my team
here in the UK and we focus mainly on
the networking between the client and
the server uh so it's kind of up to us
to make sure that all the entity types
are correctly networked and everything's
functioning the way we'd like it to in
the multiplayer game but with 60
programmers or there abouts writing new
code and making new entity types if
we've only got three actually making it
work in multiplayer my team needs to
work about 20 times faster than anybody
else you know we're good but we're not
that good so clearly leaving all the
network into the network programmers is
not going to work so what we need to do
is um have every engineer make sure that
their own code Works in multiplayer well
the problem with that is that Network
programming is really very hard and it
it can take years to learn all the
different ins and outs so we need a way
to simplify it so that you know non-sp
Specialists can learn everything they
need to do in just like a couple of
hours what we need is an API which
stands for an application programmer
interface and that's really a cushion
between a programmer doing the work and
the problem that they want to solve the
API kind of simp simplifies things by
allowing the programmer to say exactly
what it is that they want to do but
without saying how it should be done so
you can kind of think of it like driving
a car so obviously you've got your
steering wheel and the pedals and you
know other controls gear stick whatever
that's not how the car drives they ad
just the controls that tell the car what
to do so under the hood the driver's
commands are turned into you know
different settings for like fuel air
mixture or engine timing or hydraulic
pressures for brakes and power steering
and that's kind of the inter face part
of an application programmer interface
by building the right set of controls
you can change how the API actually
works without having to change the code
so what about driver error cars equipped
with assisted driving can take action
when a driver makes a mistake and
possibly prevent a crash we want the
same sort of thing from the API that
we're going to develop when a a program
is using it it actively prevents them
from making mistakes that might cause us
bugs or negatively impact performance
but we can go a bit further though So
currently the technology for driverless
cars is being developed when that
happens the skill needed to operate a
driverless car drops to just saying
where you want it to go and this is what
we've tried to do with our Network API
serialized variables are a really big
part of that by giving our programmers a
simpler model to work with they can
quickly and safely Network the game
elements that they're working on
meanwhile those Network programmers um
are freed up to try and ensure that that
the API not only works quickly and
efficiently but also it deals with all
the problems that you can get while
networking anything so before we go any
further we probably need to talk about
another question and that's how do
online multiplayer games actually work
if you were to see the game as
programmers often look at it you'd see
that everything is essentially lots of
tables of values every entity in the
game has its own table and each value
corresponds to a different property of
The Entity because we need to know what
each value is for we've got to give them
all names so a table has two columns
names on the left hand side and values
on the right a row in a table is what we
call a variable and that's mainly
because its value can change over time
the ship might have variables for shield
strength and how much fuel it's got left
um players can have variables to say
whether they're running or walking and
most but not all of these variables uh
will have an entity called a position
and that's going to tell us exactly
where they are in the the games universe
and even though we kind of need three
values for coordinates in 3D space we
tend to think of position as a single
variable because one part changes the
other parts tend to change so when an
entity moves it does so because the
position variable has been changed that
that variable is not really just keeping
track of where the entity is it's
actually saying where the entity is
programmers can write code that that
looks at the values in a in a table that
belongs to anty and we can use those
values to calculate some changes to
other variables and some of those
variables might be in the same table or
some might be in other tables belonging
to different entities so as the game
progresses these variables are modified
according to you know the actions of
players and Ai and these changes update
the the graphics that you see on screen
and they can trigger particle effects
and sound effects to make this work in
multiplayer we've got to take one
machine the
server and have that make the changes to
the tables and then the server then
needs to copy the modified tables to all
the the machines all the clients and it
does this by sending messages over the
network a bit like a group text message
and if everything works correctly the
clients and the server all have the same
data in the tables and everyone's in
sync now entities in our game can have
dozens or even hundreds of these
variables or properties and most of them
need to be kept in sync over the network
there are a few ways we could do this
and probably the most straightforward
way is every now and then just to send
the state of all the tables and that
works really well for very small numbers
of entities but as the number of
entities increases then the bandwidth
that you're using to do that increases
and if we're not careful that can cause
us other problems we might notice that
most entities in the game don't tend to
do much until someone does something to
them so what we can try is not
sending uh the table for an entity
unless it has changed but now the game
code's got got to keep track of which
entities have changed and which haven't
and that can be tricky to get right it's
a manual process that the gameplay
programs have to do getting it wrong
means that in certain situations the
tables for particular entities will no
longer be in sync we call that a desync
and the effects of that can range from
like minor bugs that are just little
annoyances to completely break in the
game and the only way to find these bugs
is suit lots and lots of timec consuming
play testing perhaps worse we haven't
really solved the band problem either by
adding more players that means that more
entities will be being interacted with
and having things done to them so more
tables are going to be getting updated
and more messages need to be sent out
over the network and the bandwidth jumps
up once again we still need to reduce
this so we might notice that when an
en's table is modified not all the
values in it are changed so instead of
sending the whole table we could try
just sending a few of them at a time so
we can split the table into
sections and then we're saving bandwidth
by only sending in the section if one or
more of the variables in it have changed
if we put variables that are likely to
change together in the same section then
we can see save even more but now the
game code's got to keep track of not
just modifications to entities but
modifications to individual sections and
that's even harder to get right we also
got to write some extra code to say
which variables need to be put into
which messages and since different types
of entities have different sets of
variables uh they also need different
sections so this extra work as to be
duplicated for every different type of
entity so the thing that really kills
this plan for Star Citizen is entity
components a component is really it's
just a piece of code and some variables
that Implement a very specific piece of
functionality so entities get built by
plugging different components together
and by choosing different components
that you want to plug together that
gives us different types of entities if
you need an entity that can move around
and collide with other things then you
have to give it a physics components
your entity needs Shields give it a
shield component the number of different
entity types we can build this way grows
exponentially with the number of
different components that we have but
what also grows
exponentially is um the amount of
networking work we've got to do to cover
all these different entity types so
clearly this isn't really going to work
for us our networking API needs to be
smarter what we wanted were controls uh
that were as simple as those for a
driverless car and what we had felt like
it was is as complicated as pilo in a
space shutle so that's when we came up
with um serialized variables so with
these gameplay programmers just need to
write their code the way they normally
would and they're adding variables to
their components uh as they need them
and the only extra thing that they need
to do is Mark the variables that they
want networked uh in a special way and
that just shows that these ones are ones
that need to be serialized serialization
is a process of packing up the data in a
form that's more efficient and better
suits being sent over the network or
serialized to a file this makes life so
much easier for our programmers you can
see how the code on the left can be
simplified and reduced to what's on the
right it's really just like writing
normal code and calling out which of the
variables we want serialized the program
only needs to write the additional lines
that you can see highlighted in purple
on the right and add them to their
struct or class definition and that
tells the serialized variable system
which members of the structure to watch
and update previously we would have
needed specific functions um in each
class one for net serialized for
networking full serial eyes for the save
game and if we wanted to talk to the
persistent database we would have needed
an extra function something like
persistent serial eyes in these
functions the game programmers would
have had to manually look at the
variables they wanted to serialize and
write them out into the serialization
stream so there's lots of scope there
for extra work and possible errors if
they forget to add a variable but now
when a programmer writes a new class
they can just mark up which of the
variables they want to be serialized and
everything else is handled automatically
and efficiently behind the scenes and
that all goes through one Unified system
that we can profile and optimize as
opposed to having to worry about
optimizing literally thousands of
different functions once the variables
have been marked there's there's no need
to group things into sections anymore um
there's no extra code to write the API
detects uh when something has modified
the value of a variable and it lets the
net code know so that I can deal with it
new API even writes uh the code to
handle the serialization for them and
this kind of level of automation uh not
only saves us time but it it eliminates
human error mean we have a lot fewer
bugs uh and we can just get on more
quickly and more efficiently so because
the net code's now being told about
changes to individual variables we're on
the networking side of a much clearer
view of what what's actually happening
in the game so you can kind of think of
it like switching to a 4K TV when all
you've ever seen before is like grainy
black and white and we we're kind of
using this extra information at the
moment so that we only send exactly what
has changed and that means that our
bandwidth perir update message the size
of our update messages is now probably
about as optimized as it's possible to
get we're also using this information so
that we can profile what's being sent by
um by the game code what when it's
marking variables dirty so we can see if
anyone's hitting anything particularly
quickly and maybe there's a bug in the
game code and he's looking at really the
only kind of over improvements that
we're we're going to get from now on by
optimizing like streams of network
messages cutting out who's sending
messages at all and how often messages
are being sent we can handle all that on
the network side on the net code side so
it's kind of like I was saying before
where we've got this interface of the
API that separates game code from what
we need to do and we can make our
changes without affecting that while we
were working on this new technology we
noticed that one of the The Entity types
started sending about 80% L data and at
first we just didn't believe that we
were certain that the numbers have got
to be wrong or that are bugs throwing
away most of the data it wasn't until
you know we went back and we double
checked everything that really we
started to realize that this saving is
actually real and that it's due to the
new code that's probably not going to be
typical but it still kind of shows that
the difference this kind of approach can
make that's not entirely where the story
ends though because one of the other
cool things about serialized variables
is that they don't just work for
multiplayer and networking instead of
sending the different tables and values
and variables between just server and
clients we can also store them in a
database or save them to a file and that
means that for no extra effort at all
the gameplay programmers can use the
same serialized variables for
persistence uh recording what's the
state of entities are is in our
persistent universe and we can even use
them for save games in Squadron 42
personally I think probably the best
thing about serialized variables is that
they're one of the the cornerstones that
we're using to build this this big
seamless persistent Universe achieving
that is going to require spreading the
load over multiple servers because it's
seamless we're going to have to have
these servers communicate with each
other and that's going to mean that
there there could be a lot of servers
aware of any particular entity so let's
say for example an AI pirate now we
don't want all the servers trying to
tell the pirate what he should be doing
because first that would be just a
complete waste of computing power and
the second reason is that the might not
agree on what the AI should do next so
we need one server that's in charge of
the AI pirate and only that server can
send updates for that AI pirate entity
and the other servers just listen to it
so the trick is going to be how we
decide which server gets the final say
and we're going to do that with
something that we're calling tokens a
token can only be held by one computer
at a time when a computer's finished
with a token it just passes it on to the
next one that wants it so by linking
serialized variables tokens together
will be able to transfer Authority from
one server to another as quickly as
flicking a switch what that means for
our AI pirate is that control over its
AI mind can pass seamlessly from one
server to another and since different
servers at least initially will control
different regions of space this
combination of tokens and serialized
variables will allow our a pirate and
everything else to move freely through
this seamless persistent universe
that's been simulated by lots of servers
all working together so hopefully you'll
agree that serialized variables are not
only a key part of the current
technology but they're they're a
building block for future ones and
that's really not bad for something that
you're never going to see but that's
often the reality of game development
and what you see in games really just
the tip of an iceberg that's being boyed
up by a mass of systems and Technologies
all working together you know out of
sight and fingers crossed lost out of
mind so as you can see the serialized
variable Tech is an important feature
for several reasons it not only improves
the games networking but also simplifies
the coding for our programmers so
there'll be fewer bugs going forward and
the same data can be serialized over the
network to the persistent database or
save the state of the game meaning we
have one unified way to communicate or
save game State um throughout everything
which is very important for a big huge
Universe like we're building absolutely
anyway that's it for today's program but
before we go uh we wanted to remind all
backers to keep your account safe by
enabling twostep authentication you can
do that by visiting your account page
then clicking on the security tab under
settings yeah it's probably a good idea
to do that and thanks to all our
