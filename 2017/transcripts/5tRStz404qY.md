## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm Sean Tracy today's
feature will take you behind the scenes
of citizencon 2947 to reveal all the
work that went into making the show but
first on today's burned-down not only
will we be looking at the issues the
team has been tackling this week but
we'll be sharing our alpha 3.0 closeout
schedule let's go to Eric for all the
details yeah yeah welcome back to burn
down our weekly show dedicated to
reviewing progress on the release of
star citizen alpha 3.0 last week we were
at 17 remaining must fix issues to close
down our next game loop of shopping
cargo and commodity trading because
we've been making solid progress on that
game loop we now want to share the other
aspects we're focusing on for PTU they
are missions ships and vehicles
traversal moby glass and performance and
stability well we've been closing down
shopping a number of remaining issues
have been going down on these categories
as well so let's jump over to the team
around the globe to see how we're
progressing
so this week we focused on shopping as
well as other bugs that we had we've
worked on commodities and basically the
kiosks associated with that the cargo
and also the physical shops we had quite
a few fixes in commodities for example
you're able to now buy stuff from the
from the shops and able to equip your
items for your personal manager we also
had all of George's Network updates and
changes went in as well in terms of the
evocati shopping push there's only a
handful of issues by the looks of things
right now before we can call that
feature sort of Eva Carson I think as it
were we're having shopping syncs daily
on this with the team at about 4 o'clock
which involves Todd as well to go over
any issues that they come up with and
any any problems they just need to talk
through which seems to be pushing things
along quite nicely so today I'm working
on a try on bug where when you try on
clothes like t-shirts and shoes and
stuff like that if you're wearing your
flight suit you do try on the clothing
but they're being hidden by your flight
suit so it's not really useful at all
you've caught me at a pretty good time
where I've got this unintentional side
effect when I try things on my character
is naked except with our helmet um and
that's because I'm trying to hide the
flight suit so that you could see the
clothes you're trying on underneath I
realize now that rather than just making
the flight suit invisible we're going to
need to detach it and then make it
invisible that way the clothing
underneath does not get occluded by it
so the problem you're seeing here is the
flight suit is invisible but the code is
saying well it's still there so it's
still covering up the other clothing so
it's invisible the other clothing is
covered up but it really just makes it
look like you're naked I've also been
chasing down a lot of bugs with missing
assets for the icons and images used in
the shopping kiosk things like the icons
that represent each item in the store
some of them were missing so I've had to
go go and hunt those
and hooked them up and some of the other
things were that we're missing were a
few of the images of the cargo boxes
that were used so I've had to basically
track those down and just make sure that
everything's using the right asset kaga
is in a really good state at the moment
at the start of the week the LA guys who
are working on the cargo system and
they've they'd reached a point where
they couldn't go any further
and now the directors are back from
citizencon they've been able to give
them a heading to take philosophy tasks
so yeah it's it's looking really good
now there's just a few last problems
we've been having with how much cargo to
put on the cargo grid in the back of the
ship and things like that now we're all
pointing in the same direction that
shouldn't take too long to get fixed up
this week this kind of been a little bit
of hang-up with they have these counters
here that have items in them that you
can purchase like ammo and grenades and
things like that and the way the
shopping system works is that a raised
cast from the player camera to the item
and that's what makes it high light
that's what gives you the shopping a our
display and well they're behind glass
and right now the glass collides with
the Ray that shoots out and so you can't
actually interact with anything behind
it but if we take out that glass
collision then you could just walk right
into the glass part of the counter and
people could stand in it and that just
be obnoxious so we've had to kind of
last minute come up with that we've got
art and engineers all kind of like
scrambling to to make sure that we have
a separate colliding surface for glass
that will properly Brock block players
from walking into it but will allow ray
cast to come through so we can still see
things purchase things and do that whole
spiel now I'm dropping in the finalized
shopkeepers and their loadouts making
sure they're all working as they
expected to and getting everything
exported for what should be the last
time for three oh we want to make sure
that when we say to the evocati group ok
shopping is now ready for you guys to
you know run with it we don't want to
have the instability that we've got at
the moment so people are only getting
sort of like 15 20 minutes worth of game
time we want to see that come up
we've done this week has included
getting about 59 of our 60-ish missions
actually playable we let's say content
complete if not polished although we
have now got dialogue into at least one
of them and we have an it little issue
that currently that only works in
single-player so that's that's one thing
we're gonna have to fix but it's all
there and once for code is fixed it's
ready to go and another massive thing
we've done this week is get all of our
missions that are given by mission
givers we've got those all behind a gate
as it were
so after we designed the MFDs to work in
the ship so that you can have control
over the various items and the ship's
including all the power laiden items the
shield related items the heat and the
Webber related items that went to the UI
team which now includes calyx and he's
implementing those screens to be useful
as far as putting them on MFDs and the
ships the bug that I'm working on right
now is for the heat screen and it
basically is that the buttons that we
have on the heat screen which are to
suppress your IR which does so at the
cost of actually increasing your item
heat per system as well as a button to
allow you to do that globally that is
well for one it's not telling you what
it's doing which is problematic and for
another problem is that when it does
activate there's actually a delay before
you're allowed to interact with it again
to toggle it on and off and this
prevents edge case behaviors from
cropping up of what happens when you
flip between a suppressed IR State and
not too quickly so we just don't allow
you to do that however at the moment
there's nothing letting you know that
you can't do that so one of the things
that I am doing is making it so that
when you select it it'll turn on and let
you know that these are the ones that
are being altered and why they can't
turn on or off and then making it so
that when you turn it off it tells you
that to super simple
those the question Chris is what what we
want to tackle for 300 with the
afterburner now what are the specific
tests that we want to I do like the
suggestion of the thrust management that
I guess you are putting out that we sail
it basically where you can go and choose
your thrusters so you could like you
know have more finer control yeah and
you could maybe even have a pre preset
on your first stuff we knew we had the
issue with the Contin trouble
overshooting you from your location from
your intended destination that seems to
be something that Mike Dillon needs to
take a look at over the next day or so
we had an issue come up with quantum
Drive where it was dropping us out
effectively seven and a half million
kilometers before Hurston prior to that
we hadn't really had a jump that many
millions of a kilometers to worry about
it's usually just jumping from moon to
moon that's all that we're really
worried about so the math issue wasn't a
huge deal but once we got larger jumper
coming much further out and the last
frame of quantum puts you where you
should be so you had this jump from
nothing to Hurston right there solution
can be we were simply doing our math off
the wrong acceleration values so we have
an initial acceleration of some slow
speed by accelerating your car up to
better refer to it going to 88 miles per
hour in the DeLorean at which point you
hit the max speed or your max
acceleration as we accelerate up we were
using the wrong value there so when we
were calculating how far you should be
going it was much shorter than you
actually would go which put us in the
wrong spot once we slowed the the ship
down to that final point swap those
values around and we finally would start
showing up as we saw in a Germany
citizencon
the ship coming right up to the planet
like it should
[Music]
issue on auras opening this movie glass
in the ship's bed will cause the UI to
look through this
you okay to clip through the ceiling
becoming unusable entrap the player and
then the next one is the movie classic
anime is missing all assets and
functionality future santa cards yeah
as for the qtr we had yesterday when I
was sick while the day dynamic Knapp
point system caused no issues related to
your code so if you're happy with what
was done there I can
over the last view evocati bills we've
been paying attention to the feedback
from the guys in the evocati we've also
had people in Austin and over here as
well monitored the server performance
and trying get as much information as we
can client-side as well from what people
tell us we have noticed that performance
as we've introduced new features as I've
said previously you introduce features
but you also then potentially start to
see some instability come in and that's
exactly what we've been seeing over the
last few evocati pushes that the the
performance is not up to what it was
when we first pushed evocati through you
know some various crashes that have
crept in and there's been some server
instability as well some server crashes
so what we've done is we're prioritizing
those up a little bit higher up the list
so we need to get back with Austin and
say look I understand that's a weekend a
surfer would be a massive someone gone
in over the weekend so when we clean the
first for the Monday that basically we
could have that we could have had that
information so we can then be passing
out to people people looking back if you
need to know on the server side why the
performance is going up or down if we
now have to wait for a key way to do it
this time zone and we're not going to
look at the stuff of the lights today
well we need to at least get if Clive
George whoever did get access to that
information if at least doing that it's
a bit of a problem with what they need
that needs to be the number one thing on
the for that team it was basically going
and breaking down and just work out this
issue John case we're now getting down
to fewer features stuff which is
typically what breaks the build we need
to get the need to get the performance
so we need to get the stability back so
we have that and then that means that we
can just keep on working towards it from
you know making choices willing to live
and so forth it's great that you're
doing the dailies Todd something that
really helps forget the feature stuff
done but we just need to get this build
working so it's fast and so for things
like that just number one on
for me on that side at the time of
filming this we're at 15 issues and
we've checked in over 529 updates on to
our 3.0 branch across the categories of
shopping ships and vehicles traversal
Moby glass and performance and stability
tomorrow on our production schedule will
be showing the remaining issues needed
to finish to release to Pt you don't
miss that update and come back next week
to see the progress we're making here on
burn down
you'll be able to check out the
production schedule report tomorrow on
our website now let's head back to
Frankfort last week the star citizen
team took to the stage at the Capitol
Theatre for a full day of panels a
keynote address from chris Roberts
featuring our procedural city tech from
Sean and much more pulling all these
pieces together whilst also working on
Alpha 3.0 and squadron 42 took a lot of
planning and coordination let's see how
it all came together in this exclusive
behind the scenes look at citizencon 29
47
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
wouldn't talk Allah
welcome to citizen pond 29:47 in
Frankfurt Germany so without further ado
we hope you enjoy the show
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
ladies and gentlemen Chris Roberts
[Music]
right hello Frankfurt so we're really
excited to have you all here in
Frankfurt Germany at citizencon 2947 so
let's see what the box delivered so here
we are
so the octane 900p which is the fastest
SSD on the planet and we've actually
been working with Intel for quite a bit
of time on this one and it's some really
really cool tech and yeah I'm gonna
throw one to the audience here who's
gonna catch all right here we go yeah so
it's a little wet for the dry ice
david blundell from Intel come out so
David it's good to talk a little bit
about the obtain and before we kick off
everything today yes thank you thank you
very much for having us here today we
really appreciate this opportunity and
today at citizencon we're actually
launching the product that Chris just
tossed out into the yes so that's a big
deal of stuff is into the fact that
we're actually part of a launch of a
major piece of hardware that's very very
cool it's a major launch for Intel of
the Intel octane 900p SSD and really
it's the first SSD for desktop and
workstation users that uses Intel obtain
technology we got together over a couple
years ago we started talking about the
attributes of this technology and we
thought this was a perfect connection so
what do you I think you can get out of
this in the upcoming release you know
it's the first generation of the
technology and it's gonna improve and
you know the operating system is going
to sort of embrace it better and
there'll be it'll be pretty cool but
it's definitely helping our development
now and I think it will be good for
anyone playing stuff with them - yeah we
definitely look look forward to working
with you on the future and then as part
of this collaboration some of you may
have noticed something new out in the
atrium did anybody see anything new a
little small thing no seriously what we
thought is hey you know there's a
technical collaboration we'll make the
gameplay better make you guys have more
fun with this thing try new experiences
but also we thought we
I translate that into a ship hi
everybody welcome to citizencon 2947
exploring new worlds we do have the big
savor every model right here it was done
by jr. fabrication it's not a life-sized
one as I told you before but it looks
super amazing and it packs a punch let
me tell you that my name is Jason Cole
I'm the lead cinematic animator for
squadron 42 and today I'm gonna talk to
you guys about look I care or pcap look
transformation alright so the left is
look like a the original system always
on and then the right is look like a
with a little bit of polish and the
animation tool kit or the look like a
tool kit and I'll let this run a few
times but you can really see the
differences pulling through now see see
he's looking right and left and he's
constantly looking back towards Seto and
we're getting a lot of smaller things in
here like head nods and little head
turns so this video was showing only a
few issues we have with stairs and
random obstacles but this list can
really endless
one way to solve this is to tell tell
animators to make more animation assets
but I think that won't
because this is one of those problems
you can see
with animation they have alone there way
too many unpredictable situations that
we just can't consider all of them the
only thing we can do is try to find
procedural tools but in star citizen
it's it's really not that simple as evil
is showing here I've never seen this
planet before and
you have situations where it's possible
what you'll see throughout the day today
where you could be on a mountain on a
planet that potentially nobody else has
been on the floor or I've never been to
no queue a guy has seen it up in some
corner of this world and you get into a
gun fight for your life and in those
situations the animation system needs to
hold up that panel you know when we put
up the summaries like animate you lose
the discovery enhancing mocap data with
procedural information
not exactly the sexiest default ILC but
I I think I think it was a misnomer you
had slid it under the radar that was an
amazing presentation this is your
citizencon is it yeah it is
Austin Los Angeles Manchester Los
Angeles and now Frankfurt is temple
techniques basically work by looking at
the previous several frames of motion in
our case we look at four frames fire and
we work out from than previous four
frames what the results should have been
there so we type of we wobble the image
ever so slightly which is impossible to
you and then over the four frames we
type of work out what the details should
have been but in that one pixel and we
can recover that and get a nice soft
result but the problem of using the
previous four frames well there's all
sorts of problems to be honest it's
caused us a lot of headaches so we have
we also have we have a lot of moving
objects awfully we've got you know
spaceships that move we've got planets
that are moving we've got all sorts of
things going on that we might not have
an in normal game and we also have a UI
transparent UI a transparent glass
screen a transparent visor all of these
things make it quite difficult to
account for the previous four frames
motion because your visor might be
spinning this way the cockpit might be
going that way you know there's all
sorts going on so we've recently done a
change that hopefully will work around
them but yeah you'll be able to see this
in fleet ones here once again
okay so that's our final frame looking
nice I think you'll agree how many
members are in your team so we have me
and five others in the UK and then we
work really closely with a Frankfort
team so there's two or three guys there
that do a lot of graphics but it's very
tightly coupled like the CPU
optimization and the planetary work why
don't you tell me about your experience
at citizencon what do you think of it so
far this is a really great event I have
seen many people I have seen many new
technologies coming and many new
technologies integrated in the project
it's really appreciated all the old
community I think it's all appreciated
by all people who came tonight
basically the first moment of being
tasked with creating a civilization
there was one question that sort of
popped into my head immediately which
was that and abject fear and terror but
once it ended basically it was a very
simple question of who are they I mean
it's that sort of thing seems like a
very obvious and an silly approach but
it actually can give you a lot of good
answers this is our lineup of our big
four plus one and so we have this is
kind of the current of where everybody
is so we have our Vandal warrior we have
our Ronin and the Tabar and we have our
traders in the band we have our humans
there and then we have our Jean
today it's important as we progress that
we don't necessarily make like a drastic
change right we want to keep true
without what everything's going if we
need a retcon something we can do that
but it's not something we want to do it
every opportunity we want to keep it
consistent and I think that's you know
going back to the Marvel way that you
were talking about how you work in a bra
you work in the broad shape first and
then you go into the details and that's
something you do for a whole race as
well you know we're not gonna try to
nail it on the first shot we're not
gonna go and maybe try to make the
perfect image the first time we're gonna
do a lot of images and see what sticks
and we're gonna go back to those see
what we're successful you know with was
SONET layer or twiddling yeah yeah Tipu
yo yo we to war what's your way with
what possesses somebody to go into that
kind of field to sit there and say I
want to create a language that's that's
my contribution it's an amazing
contribution don't mere on its I just I
have no relation I can't relate well
it's not really a field yeah I would say
you know there are a handful of people
getting to be two handfuls of people
who've done professional language
creation for entertainment franchises we
set up 24 gaming pcs and people can
enjoy the planetary play go on demo
planetary play go and demo you might
have heard about that we already had it
at Gamescom but it's a new one we got
rid of some box and we put him new stuff
one of those actually the cyber Raven so
people hear the citizencon can already
enjoy the sabre Raven fly it around so
you might have heard about this before
but hopefully there be some new stuff in
there so we always talk a lot so
what this means is it's always like the
best on in point for visual design in
the Shores that our ideas sit within
like a system tapestry kind of what we
said before because if we're working in
the corner like yeah we're gonna have
some blues and reds and whatever then
we'll get to like the rest of the system
and we'll just have like skittles
you know taste the rainbow so sure about
the fact that we were able to make
terrain it's a sphere spherical and just
holds up and work that's that's been a
challenge in itself so even when we got
to that previous slide where I was like
this is terrain and it's like on a
sphere and it's it's it's connected and
that was something new completely
brought it brought its own set of
challenges obviously just the idea that
you can walk on forever and you end up
at the same place at some point couple
days is a very long walk I never tried
and then there's a bit of improvement
some more detail we have to add another
layer of detail on top and yeah this is
what you should see here then in the
front you still see it's a little bit of
blurriness like how the textures go into
each other you have like snow going soft
into a rock that was the next thing that
we had to work on so you see some early
shots of how the terrain was blending so
you see this gallery map the splat map
doing its work saying here's here we
have some soil rocks now whatever and
then we just iterated on how we blend
the textures together to get more
variety and more variety until you have
something something more nice-looking
and in the end you end up with something
like this and you can have some two
completely different ecosystems right
next to each other what if I offered you
the ability to build your own settlement
to bring civilization to the most
untamed frontiers a colony ship in the
truest sense of the word
and I'm not talking about just
transporting people no I'm talking about
an all-in-one solution designed to build
modular structures based on your needs
capable of building a farm or a habitat
a trading post or a mining operation I
mean not to be crazy right allow me to
introduce
pioneer
[Applause]
[Applause]
so uh we're here to talk about the
Pioneer and other things that are
associated with it so right off the bat
you know that you're dealing with
function over for it's it's not gonna be
like super sexy it's not gonna be pretty
but it's still gonna have a really good
sort of well-thought-out industrial
design feel to it so you know even even
as you're walking through this thing
you're still gonna appreciate it and you
you know you've got your we're
essentially flying factory knowledge
information within star citizen is very
often on an analogue concept you don't
necessarily know something or not know
something but rather you know things to
to varying degrees and the easiest way
that I could you know give for an
example would be to consider a car that
you're thinking about purchasing if you
if you're being asked to purchase a car
and you haven't actually seen it you're
gonna be very conservative in terms of
your estimate of what it might be worth
if you're able to see it even from the
exterior and verify there's tread on the
wheels the paint job looks okay except
then that's going to increase your
perception of its value if you're able
to actually turn the car on make sure
it's running or better yet have a
mechanic you know take a peek under the
hood then that's gonna basically bring
it you know even farther up the scale
and so a lot of what we're doing you
know with the value of land which ties
over in the pioneer because you're going
to be setting up these outposts ideally
in optimal locations to exploit a lot of
this value that's sitting on the surface
of these planets talks about knowledge
what it all means but to get that
knowledge you've got to go and find that
area to to figure out what's there is is
it right for you and that's where all
the exploration ships coming in you you
could take your Pioneer and do all this
with your Pioneer but it's probably not
gonna be the best ship for scouting
locations we've got a whole wealth of
exploration ships the design for finding
that information out know what you're
building so that you don't do five trips
to horn Bock to build something so if
you know what you're building and then
you know the resources that you you're
going to need for that you'll you'll
save yourself multiple trips or it will
be one of those things where you will
need to have these resources brought to
you with the great speed comes great
risk and you've only got half the
weapons so if you messed that up you're
in trouble we see your mouth moving way
your way answering my question though
that that's really amazing itself and I
really like this that you can unlock
your face and
