everyone welcome to bug smashers I'm
your host mark gaben I have my good
friend here Patrick Salerno and he's
gonna show us what well I've got a bug I
gotta fix the saber for some reason when
saber smashes into things it doesn't
blow up correctly so I'm gonna blow it
up so you're gonna go pop pick up yep
fix it I'm good let's fix it so I
recently got a bug for the saber and the
bug was that when a ship destroys its
nose just kind of hangs there and the
rest of the ship just spirals away right
there's no breakup of the pieces so this
comes straight to me so I took a look at
the saber and I took a look at the
ticket and watch the video and someone
kind of just rammed the ship into a rock
and exploded and spiraled away so I'm
like hmm what could be causing that
right so what I did was I already fixed
the bug I'm gonna go through the process
as to how I fixed it it's usually a day
or two process as I go and trial and
error on my way through sort of various
features so since I figured out that we
ended up adding a delay feature to some
of the debris and the order that debris
needs to break off with I came up with
let's see here we got a saber on our
screen here so when we're looking at the
saber here first thing I do is I'm
trying to figure out what pieces break
off or what it's the most important
thing for me now there's two ways I can
do that in the ship here I'm looking and
I'm saying well here's my nose right and
you know it's God's a mess and damage
and then these are parts that kind of
break off with the ship now what I found
out is well there's really no effects
things had changed I needed to reorder
this stuff and add new features to it to
bring it in line what I have here is a
tool that shows the difference between
two xml's so I have the old
and I have the new version and I won't
go into too many details the specifics
of this but I ended up changing pretty
much every single part I either added
new effects I added the way it breaks
off of the ship
I changed how the pieces are layered and
how quickly they come off now in the xml
we can see one at a time I came in and
will add go to my fixed one here
update that so if we take a look at our
object I ended up adding a bunch of
effects to it as well because he was
missing effects so let's hop in and see
what it looks like prix fixe so what I
do is I hop into the editor and I'm like
well you know someone said the ship's
not braking correctly let's find out
got a couple cheats for myself dev hacks
alright great so now if I shoot the ship
I can check multiple things I can check
the DV twos I can check the damage now
from what I'm seeing we're getting some
effects right but there's nothing to do
too much going on ship blows up all
right we're at the functionality part
but we noticed that as the ticket says
the nose kind of stays where it is so
now the first thing I did was break the
part back piece by piece
now if you're just a ship and you're
peppering along the top of the ship boom
it's just gonna blow up right what
happens well the nose stayed but the
body starts going forward so I'm like
okay bug is reproducible come in and
shoot the other one see how many pieces
break off all right now it's time to get
to work we have successfully reproduced
the issue so from there what I do is I
go into 3d studio Max and I try and see
how the pieces actually break apart
right and in here I have a variety of
different ways to see what's happening
so I'm coming in as you can see I've got
this list down the side this is actually
the hierarchy of the ship it's sort of
like the skeletal bone structure of how
it's set up so when I click a wing the
wing is gonna detach we can see down
here jump straight to wing and now I've
got the wing geometry and these parts so
I'm coming in I'm taking a look I'm
checking these little green squares you
see here these are called helpers they
end up being effects making sure that
when a piece explodes melted metal
happens because what happens is I'll get
a bug for say a piece of debris
detaching but for me it's what's called
kind of like a rabbit hole notice a few
other things that I can quickly fix
while I go in there so I ended up going
in tweaking all the damage tweaking how
the debris hops off and then I went into
the ship and I shot it so now that I did
a couple changes in there what I do is I
come in here I updated my XML
and some tweaks come in to leave my ship
restart the game now I use a ship setup
level which gives me various lighting
conditions to check under this is good
for testing now boom there so now we
have new effects debris kind of flies
off and goes and this is kind of what
we're intending when he toned down my
damage so I can pick off each piece so
what I'm doing is making sure that every
single component on a ship that can
detach does correctly detach all the
pieces that detach with it also detach
with it and that the probabilities I've
set for the way the debris actually
flies off are correctly interpreted so
now the cool thing about this is if I'm
looking in the XML over here let's see
under say nose for example we have this
line here on top and if we look under
the old one I noticed that you know it's
it's got its mass and it's got it stuff
but well check this out
it doesn't actually get a CH so we have
this piece of code called attach ratio
and attach probability and we also have
other things called like random force
and base force this is this is like X Y
Z so when the nose detach is from a ship
musical right but the body needs go and
the wings need to fly off to the sides
so I say you know forceps a to
arbitrarily go that way go that way how
much it's gonna spin etc etc and then I
come down to each part and I say well
when the nose is destroyed I want to be
a slight probability of everything else
coming off - so I had to reorder these
from the original and basically nose and
body should always detach right on
destruction for effect but it has kind
of a probability to do it and a delay to
it once I'm done with all that I kind of
do that to each and every component that
does detach and then I go back in and I
start just sort of picking it apart now
if I blow up the nose
we can see the nose actually flies away
we are now working as intended after
going in and tweaking all of the damaged
components now what I do after this if
I've placed effects or I've done
anything like that I send this back to
the testers when I'm done and I ask them
to reproduce the work make sure that
what I've done has made it into the game
and then I also send my temporary
particle effects that you see flying off
the ship right now I send those to the
effects guys to make sure that I'm in
line because I don't actually make say
the particles themselves what I do is I
go into a library and I'll start placing
down one so fire sparks etc etc and you
know try and place it logically make
sure all the damage works ship melts
away so on and so forth and then once I
realize that yes debris is flowing all
if particles are happening things are
spinning I realized the ticket is that
completely and I commit my work but
that's pretty much it a little bit of
back and forth between XML when I hop
into Max and make sure that all my
detachable components work together and
that they're actually flying off as
anticipated and then in the editor I
test the setup working live in game
under various lighting conditions and I
blow it up in as many ways as possible
to make sure that it blows up correctly
otherwise that's pretty much it problem
solved
bug completed just for a quick
before-and-after again we will just get
the old file and we'll delete this
undo my delete and bring it back this
refreshes the scripts so it knows it's
up then I hop back in game one time
that's my favorite lighting condition
which is space for some reason I'm gonna
come in I don't blow it apart again and
I'll make sure that what I've done is
actually what's expected so it seems
like you know that wing takes a little
less damage than the other wing for some
reason you know that Megaman fixed he
takes a few shots he pops off let's blow
off the ship make sure that the initial
issue is still there yep no stays body
moves forward all right you don't need
to blow up the other ships to know it's
consistent get my revision again delete
these one more time just to be sure and
try it
what I'm doing is I still go through and
I make sure that yes the ship completely
explodes it has one big explosion at the
very end but each sub component can rip
off all of its other sub components
that's very important to the process
because if I say for example blow this
off but the wing doesn't blow off I have
a problem with my damage hierarchy and I
need to go and figure it out
but as we saw blowing up sort of inner
wing part actually took off the outer
part but sometimes it doesn't that's the
probability so that's actually working
as intended
great let's just finish because blowing
things up is fun there we go
fire death destruction awesome and we're
good and there we go I send it to the
final parties and get a testament
putting game so we had a fun little bug
there Patrick how'd it go yeah so far so
good I think the bugs solved the Sabre
actually breaks up correctly now you
know that's the important part also did
a few updates to how the parts break
apart what it looks like when the
particles fly off and now it's getting
tested and sent to the right parties
little XML little export little fun
pokes and buttons for something shoot
some stuff boom everyone's happy cool
hope you guys enjoyed so next time thank
