Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hello and welcome to
Around the Verse, our behind the scenes look
into the development of Star Citizen.
Our special guest host today is CG Supervisor,
Forrest Stephan.
Welcome back to the show Forrest.
Forrest Stephan (FS): Thank you for having
me, it’s absolutely great to be back.
SG: It’s great to have you back and the
big news this week is of course the Alpha
2.6.1 patch being released to the Evocati
along with a host of bug and crash fixes.
The patch includes nice improvements and continued
tweaks of weapons and flight systems.
FS: Yeah that’s absolutely fantastic.
It also has the single player Mega Map which
makes hopping around between levels a heck
of alot easier as well as multiple regional
servers which know people have been waiting
for, can’t wait to get this in the hands
of the players.
SG: Yeah we had Will, and Adam, and Dave,
they were playing around with it today having
a blast.
FS: Having a blast, totally.
SG: Before we get to the show is there anything
interesting that you’ve been working on
lately?
FS: Always interesting things.
So I’ve been helping develop the look and
the tech with art direction and cinematic
design for the holograms for capital ships.
You know the bridge holo globes in the briefing
rooms.
With all this AR stuff happening, it’s great
to actually see some hologram stuff in our
game and actually develop some custom tech
for it so it’s pretty exciting.
SG: Very cool and is that for Squadron 42?
FS: That is for Squadron 42.
SG: Alright.
FS: It’ll eventually show up in the PU,
but the focus right now is to establish a
consistent look, interface, design, a way
to communicate the briefings to the player
for the Squadron 42 campaign.
SG: I also heard that you were working on
some dead body tech.
FS: A big part of the build up for 3.0, corpses
are part of the set dressing.
You know in the wrecks, the abandoned ships
and we wanted a way to use our loadouts, our
current characters instead of placing these
temporary props so we developed a system to
use a physics based approach to having designers
place these dead bodies everywhere.
SG: I Don’t know why I find that exciting.
I don’t know what that says about me, we
can move on from there.
FS: Actually if we can show a video maybe
you’ll see how fun it actually is.
So it shows how our system is able to generate
impulses to get some fun poses.
We can create a nearly infinite amount of
variety of natural poses because it's all
physics driven and it all kind of depends
on the simulation.
SG: That’s very cool, and that will be a
great tool for our artist.
Now let's go to Jake Ross for what the Austin
studio has been up to.
[3:18] Studio Update
Jake Ross (JR): Howdy folks, Jake Ross here,
Producer of CIG Austin with a look at what’s
going on here this month here in the Austin
studio.
Lead Designer Rob Reiniger has completed his
game design document for the shopping kiosk
feature and we’re now discussing timeline
for implementation with UI team and the Game
Code team, We’re very excited to have this
feature ready to implement.
We’re excited to wrap this up because it
means pretty soon we’ll be able to use this
interface for, not just shopping but things
like items and clothing, weapons, and ship
parts in the game, but also for performing
landing pad services such as repairing and
refueling your ship, loading and unloading
cargo, and that kind of thing.
This is a huge step in the right direction
that will allow us to bring much of the shopping
experience on our website to the in-game universe.
On the animation front, the PU Animation team
has been trucking along nicely on the implementing
and polishing the “usable” animations
that will be used in both Squadron 42 and
the PU.
Currently we’re polishing up these “table
leans” that we’re using for things like
leaning on the table in the mess hall for
aboard the Idris in Squadron 42.
We’ve also been getting female versions
of the already existing male animations like
“work zones” and “wall leans” in the
game as well.
The Ship Animation team has been wrapping
up polish tasks for combat speed “enters”
and “exits” into the cockpits.
We’re hoping to wrap all of these up by
the end of the month at which point we’ll
be moving on to implementing new cockpit start
up sequences for the different cockpit types.
Which is cool.
We’re still determining who our code resource
will be … that we’ll be partnering with
on that feature but once that is done we’ll
be ready to hit the ground running implementing
awesome new interactive system for starting
up your ship before take off.
On the art side of things, ship artists Chris
Smith and Josh Coons have been making good
progress on the new and improved Super Hornet
and the Drake Cutlass Black respectively.
The updates that Chris is doing on the Super
Hornet are to bring the ship in line with
our current quality standards that we have
now.
And these are almost complete and we’re
looking forward to getting these out to y’all
in … 2 … release 2.6.1.
Over in DevOps land we’re working hard to
start supporting multi-region server deployment.
We’re very excited about this feature and
we’re hoping in the not too distant future
we’ll be able to deploy servers in more
regions than we have previously to help improve
latency among other things.
We’re hoping to use data centers around
the world to spin up more game servers in
regions like North America, Europe, and Australia.
So, yeah, that’s all I have for you this
week guys.
Thanks.
See you around.
[5.38] Back in the Studio
SG: Thanks for that Jake.
The Cutlass Black rework is really shaping
up.
It’s actually one of my favourite ships.
FS: Is it?
SG: It is.
FS: I absolutely love when we go back and
do these ship updates.
It’s such a great way to see how far our
ship pipeline has come.
Right?
SG: Not only is the tech constantly improving
but our artists keep getting better with every
ship they make.
FS: It’s incredible.
SG: Speaking of the ship pipeline, this week's
Feature Focus reveals the extensive process
ever ship goes through.
FS: Oh, it’s incredible: you have artists,
you have designers, you have directors, animators,
programmers, and so many more people all involved
from all the studios and have their hand in
creating these ships from the concept to be
flight ready for us to play with.
SG: Let’s take a look.
[6:18] Ship Pipeline Part 1: Concept to Greybox
Luke Davis [LD]: Hi, my name is Luke Davis.
I am the producer here at Foundry 42.
I look after the ship environment and U.K.
tech design departments.
Here at CIG the ship pipeline has seen a remarkable
evolution.
Before I got here at Foundry 42 we were still
outsourcing ship assets to various companies
to help finish the artwork that we didn't
have the capacity to do in house at the time,
and it proved that we had … there were very
various issues that came along with outsourcing
our assets.
One of the biggest issues was the, the communication
breakdown between the various departments,
so whereas now we have the absolute luxury
of being able to have various departments
and disciplines within the same studio.
Specifically the art director, the art team
and the tech design team are all in the same
building whereas previously what we had was
a tech design department in Los Angeles, we
had an art team here in the U.K. and we used
to outsource ships for concept and the 3D
assets to another company.
What we now have now is an official design
document that our tech design team both in
L.A. and in the U.K. sign off on and sort
of go write this how many thrusters it should
have, this is the exact animation template
it has to use, this is what weapons it should
be using and sort of give an idea on what
roughly what the ship needs.
It's minimum requirements not to define the
shape or you know how it should work.
It's just what should be in it.
Jim Martin [JM]: One thing I really like about
the process here at … at Star Citizen is
that they kick you off with ... with a 3D
kind of cheat sheet of volumes saying we need
engine size to be roughly this particular
cube, we need a gun to be this size.
They, they want to make sure that as you start
thinking about it, you're kind of aware of
what the, what the different shapes and what
the different proportions are.
And that really helps me out, because when
I start a design after I've looked at reference
and the past ships and thought about myself
on course design-wise I'm going to go in and
begin with a sketch pass.
And that's my thinking pass.
You know when I have a pencil in my hand and
I have paper in front of me and I'm just noodling
and drawing that's when I'm really getting
my head around what I want the design to be
or how it should balance or, or what the proportions
could be.
And so in my first physical pass with the
Buccaneer I did a kind of big cheat sheet
that was basically kind of pared down to the
most simple components: engines, cockpit,
guns, wings.
You know let's move stuff around and let's
kind of see if we can get a feel for it.
LD: So one of the challenges of the ship being
in the concept phase is not just to make a
pretty ship, it's to make sure that it works
for what we want in the game.
So you know you'll, you'll take what design
wants, what Chris originally envisioned for
the ship, and try and turn it into some sort
of image.
Elwin Bachiller [EB]: What tends to happen
when we get a concept into production is we're
handed a series of images that have been finalized,
final paint overs and just beautiful illustrations.
In addition to that we also tend to get a
concept model which is what the artist use
to paint over and do his final renders.
To actually make that usable we tend to have
to rebuild that model.
We can't just … I mean we can technically
take that and put it directly into the game,
but it would be very expensive, because the
cost of models tend to not worry about poly
count anything like that, and also it wouldn't
conform with some of the technology we are
using.
So, we essentially have to just rebuild that
model, but in most cases we aren't just rebuilding
the model we're also making some changes along
the way, especially as we discover changes
that we have to make due to the white box
phase.
JM: As the concept guy you're, you're used
to getting the ball rolling, but then once
the ball is rolling you want that collaboration
with, with the physical design team that's
going to be doing the, the actual 3D of the
ship.
You know and you want … because they keep
you honest and then you also keep them honest
and you know they'll … they may kick an
idea to you and go, “Well, you know, the
engines are a little too close we need to
balance, balance”, then you’ll say, “Well
I can do this”, so it’s sort of a really
great back and forth that I think is really
important to the process.
LD: One of the biggest issues that we have
in concept is the actual metrics because you
have Chris on one side wanting the ship to
look a particular way as does the art director,
the art director is constantly adjusting based
on the feedback Chris provides and the biggest
difficulty is trying to keep the gameplay
metrics that we need to work in the game such
as the animation template.
So animation have four current ships it provides…
for each ship we have there’s a template
attached to it and we have to make sure now
not to make anymore templates except when
it’s absolutely needed and if we can use
an existing one that works.
So we go, “Right you know what, we would
like same entry animation as we did on the
Gladius, now try to use that entry animation
on that new ship.
How would it work?
What are the challenges that come with it?”
and it’s just to make sure everyone’s
involved in communicating with everything
what their new risks and issues are as part
of that pipeline.
EB: So what we tend to do is we’ll get the
concept model if we have one and we will essentially
build a rudimentary version of the ship.
It doesn’t have anywhere near the detail
that the final model is going to have, but
it serves as a representation for us to start
playing around with gameplay elements.
So once we have this rudimentary model, we
can throw that into the game super fast and
working with the tech design team we can start
actually adding weapons to it, we can start
actually adding a rudimentary cockpit and
have positions for the animations to work
properly.
So we can actually go into the game, walk
up to this very blocky looking ship, press
a button and then climb into it and start
flying the ship really early on within the
first week and a half to two weeks of production
and this is what we call the white box phase.
MS: For the design side of that, that’s
mainly just setting up some basic helpers
and hardpoints.
Get some thrusters on there, make sure it
flights, make sure it putters around and that’s
also when we do a lot of the initial placement
for thrusters.
So we need to make sure they’re distributed
evenly across the ship, they’ll be balanced,
that’s going to handle right and get the
kind of performance that we want it to.
LD: So once the disciplines have had a look
at it, and that’s the main part of the whitebox
is that people look at it and go, “Right,
I’m ready now, I’m ready for when the
ship goes into production so it is further
down the production”, the UI team have a
look at it and gone, “Okay, they’ve done
the metrics right, the screen layout is completely
correct, we don’t need anything new, we
are good to go”.
The VFX department go, “Right, you know
what, the thrusters are in the right place,
and the removeable thrusters are correct,
they know what type of ship items it’s using,
we’re good to go as well”.
Then that’s the main bit of the white box
phase.
MS: Then it’s handed back to our ship artists
and they just build it out and make it look
fantastic during the greybox stage.
EB: On the Greybox phase, that’s where the
artists tend to do a lot of heavy lifting
on the geometry so we’ll actually start
building very close to final geometry.
We’ll start adding bevels, or as max usually
calls, “chamfers” all over the ship into
order to use custom normals on our ships which
make it look as though its higher geometry
than it actually is.
Custom normals is a technique that we use,
essentially we call it custom normals, but
the geometry that we have, each vertices on
the surface has a direction which determines
how the light bounces off the surface.
So typically there’s a technique called
subdivision modeling where you’ll take a
surface and an edge and you will sort of reinforce
that edge by adding multiple loops to either
side of where you want the light to bend and
that will give you a sort of nice flat surface
on one side, and then a crisp little bend,
and then a flat surface on the other side
so it looks really smooth.
We really can’t afford to add that much
geometry because it makes everything a lot
more expensive to do it with that technique
so what we do is we’ll take the vertices
and instead of reinforcing the edges, we’ll
add a single chamfer, and we will then tell
the vert to have the tangent pointing it exactly
where we want them to go and it will give
us the illusion of having a reinforced edge
without having a reinforced edge.
So it gives us a much cheaper asset in terms
of geometry, but the quality is just as good
and it ends up making the ship look really
cool, but that’s essentially what we do
in the greybox phase is build as close to
final geometry as we can using only two tones
to break up the surface.
So we’ll have a light grey and a dark grey
or maybe a high spec value, a low spec value,
just to get a basic breakup of the colours
and how we’re going to break it up on the
exterior walls.
We’ll also do more finalized animations
in this stage.
So we’ll go ahead and build full landing
gear and actually do the folding up and closing
to make sure everything closes perfectly and
looks beautiful.
And we’ll do this for landing gears, we’ll
do this for ladders, we’ll do this for the
cockpit canopies: anything that moves on the
ship is something that we end up animating
within the greybox phase mostly because we
can’t build the final geometry without knowing
how it’s going to move.
So it’s really important for us to work
on animation and building simultaneously.
LD: Because when you go into greybox you start
needing to … Tech Design get much more involved.
They have a working ship, or … in whitebox
form, and their job is then to go and make
it flyable in the engine.
And of course it’s only going to be a flyable
whitebox, but it’s flyable nevertheless.
And it’s trying to make it work for all
the other disciplines.
The goal is at the end of the Tech Design
greybox phase, is that other disciplines have
something to work with.
MS: Once I get it back from there it starts
getting into more of the nuanced set up.
So really getting final thruster items hooked
up and not just placeholder items.
Making sure all the guns are seated properly.
Making sure everything is functioning - giving
the player the right line of sight.
Making sure they have the right speed or convergence
angle.
Just all that real core tuning that starts
to really build a ship out and give it its
character.
EB: So we try to produce a ship thinking about
the kind of experience and feeling that the
player is meant to have.
And you can really see this exposed in a lot
of our bigger ships that have large interior
environments.
So some ships are meant to feel very sleek
and clean, luxurious - so you’ll have a
lot of clean walls, a lot of brightly lit
areas.
And some ships are meant to feel really claustrophobic
and unsafe.
The Caterpillar is a great example of that:
it’s dark, it’s dank; there are a lot
of sharp edges sticking out.
So we can also communicate that character
with our animations.
So one really good example of that would be
the way … something as simple as the way
a door opens.
If you have a very smooth, quick movement
on the door it gives you the sense that everything’s
working properly; there’s no mechanical
problems with it.
Whereas opposed if you have a door that jerks
a little bit and looks like it’s scraping
across the side as it moves out you get a
sense that the ship’s a little bit more
dilapidated.
That kind of thing.
So when we build ships here we try to build
our proxy animations to have some of that
feeling in them.
So if a landing … if it’s a ship that’s
not meant to be perfectly smooth and perfectly
refined - the Buccaneer's a great example
of this as well - we would like the landing
gear to deploy and feel like it’s dropping
before it gets caught because it’s not a
perfectly smooth transition.
So that’s … those are just a few of the
ways that we try to add character and personality
to the ships.
MS: One of the things that we’ve done really
well with building out the Buccaneer is … even
before the first whitebox was checked in Elwin
had been planning out a new … just a new
way of laying out some of the files or ... updating
our current method of laying out the file
inside 3D Studio Max that has really sped
up the process on doing hand-offs between
art and design where an issue can be called
out.
“Okay, cool”.
The feedback goes back and forth.
And I can still work, set everything up, without
ever having to worry about their work overwriting
mine or mine overwriting theirs.
So it just removes a lot of roadblocks and
that way it lets us - even with any uncertainty
- it lets us be agile enough to jump onto
the Buccaneer or the Cutlass or whatever other
ship or task is coming up when the time comes
for it.
LD: The Drake Buccaneer is now considered
greybox complete in the production pipeline.
There’s still many steps remaining before
it can be considered flight ready and we’ll
be back later when it is.
20:30 Outro
SG: A lot of really great info in there and
it’s fun to see how everything comes together.
FS: Yeah it really is.
And of course us developers can only do so
much, we rely a lot on the feedback that you,
the backers, provide to us.
All of your testing is vital to the project
so keep playing, contributing through the
Issue Council and the forums.
SG: And Star Citizen would not be what it
is without your support.
FS: And the support of our Subscribers.
SG: That is very correct.
And it’s thanks to them that we’re able
to share the in-depth, behind-the-scenes shows
we bring to you weekly.
Thank you all so very much.
FS: And that’s our show for the week.
SG: That’s our show.
Who knew?
Make sure to tune in tomorrow 12pm Pacific
for the latest Happy Hour stream to what some
live gameplay and discussion with Lead Writer
Dave Haddock.
FS: Oh, awesome.
And until then …
Both: We’ll see
you around the ‘verse.
