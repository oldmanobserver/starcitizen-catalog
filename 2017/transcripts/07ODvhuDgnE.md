Mark Abent: Hey everyone, welcome to Bugsmashers.
I’m your host Mark Abent, I’m here to
take you behind the scenes on how we smash
bugs.
Hey you guys, I am here in another fun test
level and got a report of a bug, I should
say a crash when we bring in an AI Constellation
so let’s give this a try.
Woo Constellation, drag that guy in, let it
load… oh, big ship.
Building all the shaders for him, all right
so let’s pop in the game.
Pop out of the game and see if we can get
that crash and crash?
Ah, crash.
So this is actually a specialty crash, we
have these things known as fatal errors when
the code gets into a specific section of code
the programmer may add this fatal errors saying
you should never get here, if you get here…
here is a complete call stack so we can log
it and try to figure out how we got to that
spot and so this specific call stack or should
I say crash.
Saved, not saved level, hit the break point.
We’ll go to here, so this is our component
batch updater so we have an entity or this
Constellation and then maybe composed of a
bunch of entities…
I’m sorry, components like physics, geometry,
interactions, all sorts of things and if they
want to do an update they go through this
batch updater so they can get batched and
then multi threaded update or in the regular
main thread update.
You’re not supposed to be able to register
these updates when the entity is shutting
down, cause when we shut down the entity we
remove all the components, remove all the
updates and so if you’re trying to register
an update during this phase…
well, bad things will happen.
So we want to know when people get to this
point and unfortunately the editor is a little
special child where on the same frame that
we destroy…
the interior or should I say all the entities
in the level we actually created again.
So what we have is the Constellation getting
deleted and then getting created and when
something gets deleted we mark it as garbage,
and that’s how we know it’s going away.
Doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to
be removed, it’s basically ‘oh I have
some trash cans, I throw some trash away.
Garbageman hasn’t picked it up yet, but
he might tomorrow, he might today, might sometimes
later’.
This bit of code was only checking to see
if it’s in the garbage bin, technically
you shouldn’t be able to register when you’re
in an update…
when you’re in the garbage but it shouldn’t
be a fatal error either because you could
register but it should abort out and only
during the actual shutdown phase should this
go south.
We’re going to change this bit of code so
if we’re in the garbage and our entity is
actually really, really shutting down the
garbage man is coming to pick him up.
Then we’ll fatal error because something
seriously has gone wrong, otherwise we’ll
just skip out because… and we only want,
actually we just want to skip out all the
time.
We only want the fatal error if we’re shutting
down the actual entity.
So we threw it in the garbage bin, if someone
registers for an update, it’ll just get
ignored because this thing is going to get
deleted.
It’s just one of those funky things where,
yeah you marked it as deleted but none of
the components on there know it’s getting
deleted yet because well, we’re not in the
process.
So for now we just go, ‘yeah we’ll just
ignore this update because trust us it’s
going to get removed’ and we won’t crash
the game horribly.
Instead we’ll just softly ignore it and
the game code will delete it sometime later
and everyone will be happy.
So, let’s give this a compile.
All right, we’re back in the amazing test
level see what happens when we plop down another
AI Constellation… let it load.
Ha, there we go and now we’ll hop in game
mode, and
then pop out of game mode and no crash, right?
Ah, no crash, perfect.
So, in the deletion phase is a little bit
tricky cause you always have to inform certain
systems some things are getting deleted but
you don’t want to inform certain things
until you’re in the actual, ‘yes, this
is the deleted phase’.
Since this is one of those lower end systems
it needs to know exactly where we’re at
and then once we get to the actual shutdown
then the components can know where they’re
at too.
So that in between phase is kind of one of
those weird things you have to get just right
especially when editor and game code which
do things a little bit differently.
Hope you guys enjoyed, til next time.
So, as you guys saw we had a little bit of
issue with the designers, they were hitting
a part of the code that would stop the game
cause they were hitting a spot we did not
want the code to run in that area.
At the same the editor was doing something
special where getting to that section of the
error was technically a legit path, so we
had change to the code a bit so that it still
will not hit that specific section while still
allowing the editor to do its little specialty.
Just another day in game development, hope
you guys enjoyed.
Til next time.
