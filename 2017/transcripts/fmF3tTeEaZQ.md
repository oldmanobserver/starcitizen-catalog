hey everyone we are here in my fancy
Dancy test level and we have a cutlass
who has some awesome weapons on it and
so we start shooting you can see all the
fun stuff but unfortunately this guy is
actually shooting the top turret weapons
which is not supposed to happen I am
moving around out of the Sun making it a
little bit hard to see there we go
right into the sunlight blindness guy's
face okay he's living around a bit there
we go so the way that these designers
have set this guy up was in the front
let me shoot these weapons there's four
guns in the top are two two on the top
two on the bottom four that the cope of
that piece pilot one of those days for
those weapons the pilot is only supposed
to be able to shoot the turret itself is
supposed to be a secluded little section
that only the guy in the turret is
supposed to shoot unfortunately the way
that everything has managed is that the
pilot is able to just go you know what
screw your rules I'm doing everything
I've turned on this little debug and on
the bottom the fourth and fifth weapons
as you can see are being controlled by
me the guy sitting in the pilot's seat
with a priority of 10 however the way
that the XML is set it up is on the
turret those weapons are supposed to be
exclusive for the turret that means only
he and only he alone give to control
those well obviously the pilots like you
not screw you I'm taking control of you
got any problem too bad
so what's happening well simple well fun
simple we have here the control manager
code and basically we have the top level
vehicle and then it's kind of like a
treat the control manager will have a
list of controllers we'll have in this
case we have weapon controllers so the
pilot will have his own
and controller and the chert will have
its own weapon controller and then
underneath that is the weapons
the idea is you control the weapon
controller and it has control the subset
of weapons so if you're interacting with
the UI you tell the weapon control what
to do and the weapon controller tells
the guns to do stuff you damage the
weapon controller you can't control guns
funds gameplay and when this thing the
control Manor it's supposed to build
this web of networks to figure out if I
sit here where am I supposed to have
control and then if I leave who would
take control of it afterwards and we do
this with a graph and on this graph this
is where we create our links so as we
create our little trees this establishes
those links and when you sit down it
figures out where the control paths
should go unfortunately when you sit
down so we have the pilot and he's on
this section he's gonna look everywhere
to see if he could link to stuff and
he's figuring out oh I can link to these
guns on the turret because well I am
told to look into any weapon and have
the priority of 10 just the way it is
the turret is going well I should link
to these but I have it exclusive so I'm
gonna say exclusive however in the order
of operations the seat comes first and
it tries to make a link and it makes
links to stuff but it and everything's
good
the turret comes in then makes its
exclusive links but now we have two
things linking and the weapon when you
sit down in the seat he goes oh there's
no one taking control of it I have party
10 I'm gonna do it then you go sit down
the turret and I'll take it away but it
shouldn't even be doing that so what we
should do here is in this bit of code
when we want to sit down we check to see
what can control this node so if we are
the weapon we look at all the links that
are established to us and we see who's
and why could control us and what we
want to do is if we have we have this
exclusive link on the turret we don't
want to allow this
a pathway to continue so we're gonna
find this exclusive link and if it
exists what we want to do is prevent the
guy over here from accessing it now we
still need that link because when he's
sitting down he may want to observe that
turret but he shouldn't be able to
control it so we still need a link to
everything so that we could see on our
screen oh that gun is overheating or
that gun is you know and taking too much
power I'm able to turn it off but we
shouldn't be able to control it so let's
hit recode and see what happens alright
so now we're recode we're still in the
broken shipment so we're gonna spawn
ourselves into a new ship so we're a new
ship let's go find the priorities of
this guy all right where to go there it
is so as you can see now we don't have
priority over the turrets because well
we shouldn't the turret has the
exclusive priority so we're at turn off
the debug move our camera around a bit
and you'll see that I'm actively
shooting the four guns in the front but
I no longer have control of the turn so
now if you want to be able to shoot
those you got to go tell your good buddy
to go run to the back to shoot now this
is totally up to the designers how they
want to set up the ships you may have
some ships that well the Turk can
control because that's the functionality
or this particular turret can't this is
the beauty the priority system and then
even extending into the future we be
able to allow you guys to dictate who
gets control of what within a limited
scope but for now we need to make sure
that the control flow follows the rules
so that in the future everything will
work as intended
let's hope you guys enjoy them
so we fixed this little bug just like
how we took care of the hard drive that
anymore we had a little bug where you
sit in the seat take control of the
turrets not cool have some fun with it
made sure we fixed the priorities
everything was good to go and then now
pilot takes control of his stuff and the
gunner takes control of his everyone's
happy everyone has their own stuff and
good to go hope you guys enjoyed until
next time thank you for watching so if
you want to keep up with the latest and
greatest in star citizen and squadron 42
