## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm Chris Robbins today is a
holiday in the u.s. so our teams in Los
Angeles and Austin are enjoying some
much-deserved time off yes definitely
because of this we don't have a feature
for today's episode but we do have some
exciting news yes we do that's right as
I'm sure you've heard Alfa 3.0 has gone
to a wider pto and gone beyond over
today a vacatio evocati evo cutting
anything so let's see when it went into
getting the build ready for this
expanded group of testers in this week's
burn down welcome back to burn down our
weekly show dedicated to reviewing the
progress of the release of star citizen
alpha 3.0 in the past week we've made
tremendous progress towards the release
of PTU as we focused on the categories
shopping missions ships and vehicles
traversal moby glass and overall
performance and stability so let's check
in with the team to see how each
progressed this week we did a review of
the physical shops from my standpoint
they were feature complete then we've
been focusing on missions and getting
the item 2.0 ships completely set up
from tech design standpoint we feel
we're feature complete on that except
for a minor one minor bug and then from
there we're still working on the item
2.0 HUD and combat indicators for those
ships and in getting that to feel right
and then we're doing a review of the
commodities today and ideally that is
feature complete and that will get
turned to green and from there we will
continue to basically focus on stability
and performance one of the things that
we knocked out this week was a raycast
issue that was causing memory crashes
and overall performance issues so
ideally the evocati see a gain in
performance based off of that but
that's been plaguing us for a little
while so getting nothing knocked out was
good and then from there it's just been
general stability and performance issues
that we've been focusing on and then
everything that the team's been working
on is really been going towards those
tier zeros that we've called out
so this past week we had a review of the
shop locations in 300 with chris and
todd papy and all the other directors we
went through each shop we experienced
the shopping flow and experience
I got to see view the shopkeepers in
action you know what really really well
there's a few bugs that were still
working to working through and to get
get to get fixed but overall the shop
locations in a really good shape and
ready to release in 3 and 3.0 so we're
in bug fixing and polish mode now and
there's there's plenty of stuff still to
do lots of bugs to fix up but we're
ready to release these things live to
you guys so we're really really excited
about that so I've been going through
commodity by commodity and setting the
profit margin range each commodity has
its own profit margin range that scales
roughly with its base value but it's not
a linear relationship so that's taken
some time to go through and just make
making sure that there's never any one
commodity that is always the best thing
to trade because that's what we don't
want to see you we don't want these
players to get to a point where there's
just one trade of trade route that's the
most lucrative and then that's it and so
a lot of my work the last day or two has
been just making sure that we're in a
good spot there
so this past week we got miles eckhart
the one of the mission givers in three
Oh into QAS hands so he's he's being run
through his paces QA has kind of taken
him through his flow identifying issues
and and calling out blockers those tech
blockers are being looked at by our
developers and getting is getting
getting resolved and at a good pace and
we're turning attention we have turned
attention to route o as well in getting
him all situated pretty soon we'll be
able to get him into QA his hands as
well and so the mission givers are
coming along pretty nicely
on the ship setup side we've finally
gotten the ships to a point where we
have gotten them out to the avocado and
we're ready for them to really bang on
them and test them in their in their
full capacity this on the setup tasks
this past week we were able to knock out
the the headlights getting all the
headlights set up so that they actually
work when you're going onto the the dark
side of a moon and you want to explore
the headlights will actually turn on now
and you can have a pointing and tweaking
with with distance and brightness but
for the most part they're all set up now
we're also got the the beds and all the
ships set set up with the savegame
logout functionality so that when you
get into the bed you can actually log
out of the beds now and persist in that
location so we're really excited about
that functionality and that will be
online in the live environment here
pretty soon as well we have a big
spreadsheet full of full of the
different ships and all the different
setup features that we need to get
implemented and at the start of this
endeavor they were all red all their all
red cells meaning they hadn't been done
yet and for the most part we've got them
all to green now so we're we've got a
nice pretty green spreadsheet lots of
things been accomplished this past week
and we're ready for for lots of testing
bit to be done on those ships so one of
the things that we're looking to
implement we're 3.0 is persistent
spawning so one of the things that tech
designers doing at the moment is going
through all of the beds in-game in the
ship's and adding an interaction point
to those so that the player when they
get into the bed they can basically save
their progress and that will log them
out as sleeping in the bed basically so
what we've been doing at the moment is
adding interaction points to every
single one setting them up in data and
basically saying when the player
interacts with this specific point we're
telling them that this is where they're
logging in and that's where they'll
remain until they look back and again
for the 3.0 ship burned down we've been
making a lot of progress fixing bugs on
ships in particular the caterpillar
these glaive inside three kind of series
the Mustangs
the Aurora and
the constellations including fixing
those bugs we've been implementing new
features such as the new bed interaction
feature which allows to do the save and
exit interaction on them we've also
implemented the new light feature which
allows us to have controllable lights
which gives us the ability to turn on
headlights in the ship's so we can see
into the dark areas of the planets and
we're currently in the midst of doing a
first pass on item 2.0 items balance so
that we can do things like actually
control the power plants and the sheer
generators and the weapons and make
meaningful choices when we're flying the
ships and sliding those dials on the
MFDs that we've just fine-tuned and are
getting the features that you can
control on those MFT is working so I'll
just tick it that says the ESP is broken
ESP is what helps you stay on your
target when you're flying across the
space and you want to dogfights and it
helps you to lock your pips so it's
easier to land your shots the ticket
says that it's broken
after quantum drive caught him traveling
and so we the ticket was first sent to
Michael who works on quantum drive and
basically we took took a look at it and
figured that it doesn't really involve
quantum drive at all so I I jumped in
and tried to figure out if it was
involved targeting so because targeting
is what shows on the Pips and ESP is
broken if your target is inaccurate so
me and Mike me and Michael were looking
at it for a couple hours and we figured
we've jumped all over around the
universe we locked on two different
targets both allies N and it means that
we can't figure out what's going on and
so we have a hard time even figuring out
if it was working or not or if it was on
or off and so we started looking at the
code to see if
hood turn the ESP on or off and turns
out you can so he followed that
tractor-trailer turns out that the UI
for ESP is broken so it would always
show that it was on so we figured so if
we do this quick fix at least he'll be
accurate and show that it is on or if
it's off and so I put the fix in and
then we went back and flying around and
walking on two different targets and
tracking them and we still can't figure
it out so we look back at to what the
ticket supplied and it said that ESP is
broken and had a five second video of
youth of just swinging back and forth
against the target and we spend a couple
more hours and it turned and we started
feeling like if none of us can figure it
out and QA can't figure it out then
probably it was a user error because the
the different keyboards that you that
are involved in just playing this game
it's pretty it might be possible that
the that you hit and actually turned off
ESP the UI didn't update and so you
don't know that it's off and then when
you try to lock on and it's broken
so we put that fix in and everything
looks fine we're sending it back let's
see how it goes from we will see how the
QA feels about it
and many days that come in there's a
fire to put out and today was no
different there was six major issues
blocking us from releasing to the
evocati and eventually the PU one of
those issues was all the ships were
missing their LEDs and the LEDs are the
level of detail meshes that as you get
away from the ship it goes lower
resolution what was happening was it was
showing a very low resolution model up
close and then it would disappear as you
went away from the camera so we had a
lot of missing assets and you would
usually think this was an art issue but
we know that these were working in the
game not too long ago so
the fact that all 30 or 50 ships
suddenly were missing these was very
curious so we started looking into the
issue and we thought well let's test
this on our development build let's test
it in the editor and it was fine in that
order fine in the development build then
we went over to QA and asked them to
look at it and they noticed that it was
only happening in the shipping build now
shipping build and development build
where we work it's a little different
there's a little different ways they
build those processes different flags
that get set not enough not as much
information gets put in the shipping
bill because it's a little more
streamlined so we were looking at it
since we isolated it only to the
shipping build we started looking at the
data inside the shipping build and we
can tell that the build process had not
put the correct files into our p4k
pack files so once we realized that we
contacted our DevOps engineer miles and
he was able to clear the cache and solve
the problem this week we had quite an
interesting set of tasks given to us by
a design which started from the Swanberg
and which was related to a basically
headlights on a ship not working
properly which evolved into creating a
new system of light grouping for
headlights for every ship on 3.0 and in
future developments where players are
actually able to control and toggle
headlights or spotlights on their shapes
whenever you know their carrier or you
want to illuminate the surface of let's
say an asteroid when you're looking for
something which is quite an interesting
and a very very strong visual and it's
something that was missing from some
ships before so because it had to be
done on every 3.0 shape and every ship
has its own separate task it also
actually resolves quite a big chunk
20 I would say tasks on our to-do list
before we are ready to push for a pity
you and it was quite a quite a quick
task it literally took me about one hour
to do all you had to do is separate
their headlights or the spotlights from
the existing lightening rig into its own
layer assign a new light group just for
them and just stick a box which allowed
players to use a shortcut to turn them
on and off I had to do it for every
single shape and just like that about 20
tasks were done in a very very short
amount of time
this week we've been focused on getting
things ready for when we go to PT you
part of the big piece of this is
updating our traversal experience how
ships fly and travel through our
expanded universe a big piece of this
has been updating our navigation points
for quantum travel as well as doing a
lot of fine-tuning on the atmospheric
flight systems as well as some of the
more interesting flight systems that we
have for vehicles like the NOx the
dragonfly those will be really exceeding
exciting to see in game so look forward
to that but this has come with another
challenge and that is making sure that
we have the performance that our fans
expect so we've had our lead engineers
Chad McKinney and mark even working on
performance related issues in order to
bring that experience up to the high
fidelity and high speed that we hope to
see in the finished product for the
quantum drive we've been working on a
lot of visual effects work recently
so we've took the old system which was
using a different set of triggers and
such it was basically state driven every
time we entered a new state of the drive
the spool the ramp the travel we would
just say okay far off these effects that
took a lot of a lot of the control away
from design on how they wanted it to
behave
so we've instead change it to a velocity
based system so now instead of it being
this effect plays when we enter this
effect or this stage of the drive so
spool up play this effect it's now when
the ship reaches this velocity play this
effect it gives designers a lot more
control over how the visuals are going
to look and gives our artists more
control over how things develop through
the flow as well as controlling our
short and long range travel we also
implemented our dynamic nav points so
the internet network around a planet is
no longer has to be placed by our
designers it can be generated
dynamically and controlled based on what
you're actively targeting so it doesn't
flood the players screen with all kinds
of useless data if they don't want it
they can drop their quantum target
they'll go away have combat and then
bring it back up whenever you need to
those have been the big things we've
been pushing for this past week or so
43.0 so in the last week I have closed
that a lot of issues with the help of
John to do with gravity being quite
unstable so things like for example the
gravel of bikes flipping up
sigh down and getting stuck in the
geometry and just nothing able to write
themselves so now they can fix that
problem without much issue we've also
had things like strange forces that just
come out of nowhere and kick gravlax up
into space I guess so those have been
resolved as well and general sort of
issues where gravel up bikes
lose control we had one issue where you
would turn left specifically left and
the grappler bike would tumble and then
carry on if you tried to go right it
wouldn't happen which is the exchange we
fixed that issue as well
we still haven't quite got it yet we're
also looking into issues where there are
these huge forces that occur whenever
you drive a gravel a bike up to a big
rock and gravel adjust panics and goes
oh no you're gonna hit the rock and it
just flings you up into space so that's
been sort of limited and I think with
that issue and with the atmospheric
stuff the John's been working on where
you get this turbulence that I mentioned
earlier just making sure that they all
work together and there's no other
issues on top of that and pretty much at
that point where Pete are you ready with
this this is ready to go and it feels a
lot nicer than it used to
okay so I was investigating in PTU burg
where as players are flying around the
PU new objects were not rendering in and
it was just basically missing from all
the locations that you visited the issue
was that the streaming system was
essentially stuck so as new objects were
requested to stream in they were not
getting updated and therefore they were
not getting loaded and not getting
rendered to resolve the issue we first
had to gather the information some
information from the evocati and QA
where we basically exposed some debug
streaming information into the release
builds so that we could essentially see
if what kind of issue was happening with
the streaming system was it stuck was
running out of memory was over budget
that sort of thing once we got that
information we realized that essentially
the stream system was stuck and then as
new objects came in they were not
getting updated not it wasn't going over
budget it was just not getting updated
and to resolve this issue we essentially
found the cause was that the streaming
system relied on a
checked update every naught point 1
milliseconds and as you are connected to
the server
it was storing that value in a float
which after a while a lost position and
so it couldn't represent nor point 1
milliseconds anymore and therefore it
never got into the block to update the
importance value of the objects and it
never got streamed in and basically to
resolve it we changed that time a check
to be to work on a frame Delta time
rather than so absolute time it was just
looking at the difference how much time
has passed since the last frame and that
resolved a streaming system bug
I am primarily working on hooking up the
radar gameplay in a scanning gameplay to
the UI and the MF DS and the visor
interface that will let you know that
you are radar and scanning game playing
like that when that it happens at all
because the the underlying mechanic is
that is a is a location versus another
location versus the ambient signal
between versus what you're doing and
what they're doing all of which is
basically invisible until we put it on a
screen and says it happened or it didn't
and so part of it is getting readouts
from the things you're scanning and
reporting that information on screen in
a way that makes sense and is generic
enough that we can use it for debris or
a vehicle or a planet or a jump point or
whatever else to the point where we'll
want to be able to extend this to being
able for like police scanners to scan
the ship and its cargo and its crew and
have the the feedback on that go over
time and let everybody know that it's
even happening so that's the once you
have that information I the part of a
part of it is displaying it the other
part is the gameplay of getting it of
manipulating your scanner to focus in on
one part of space or to expand out to
get a more broad sweep of the area and
so all the the controls to manipulate
that and to demonstrate to you what it
is you're doing when you push buttons
and gameplay happens is that's what
we're doing we find multiple challenges
with displaying information to the
player right now all of the ships have
their own kind of display systems and
we're adding a new one
basically for scanning and trying to
locate other players this is a challenge
because we don't want to clutter the
play
with too much information we want to
make it basically the essential for the
player to if they want to scan something
they can easily do it and they can get
all of the information in a simple and
clear way to make them make better
decisions react faster just basically
make gameplay more fun for them so last
week we had a few more polish tasks left
for the starmap
these have been done so the star map is
basically a bit you ready
there is one more task we need to I need
to submit we are not submitting right
now to prevent any instability for the
first BT release but all will probably
be submitted for the next patch after
that on the radar to disarm it to radar
conversion I'm I've been able to get
some more work done we have now a nice
transition between the star map and the
radar so if you zoom in and too much
will all go smoothly I'm going to get
like a video together today and I show
it to the team to get some feedback and
see where we go from there in regards to
the raycast issue that's the programming
team took care of it took roughly a day
and a half of all the senior engineering
programmers here in Frankfort to track
that sucker down and kill it so the
mission manager that's been Peter you
ready for about two or three weeks this
last week Todd again reviewed it with
some of the other designers later I've
identified the last few fixes that
they'd like so right now waiting the
process of estimating those out get them
into schedule and then we'll see where
that force for again to the last few
fixes before we go to before no life
then we've gotta have one let me start
the live sing so you wanna take it away
firstly we pushed to on Friday
and again on Saturday which is pretty
good we've got a feedback report from
from will leverets the QA responded to
in the last sort of our also
highlighting some bug highlight in the
bugs that chris that we'll call that in
there for the ships the service
stability I'm just trying to take a look
at it now
for the most part seemed not too bad I
couldn't see anything in there that
highlighted anything particularly
dreadful but of course I can ask after
the guys in the meeting in a little bit
other than that the main things to sort
of highlight where there's a couple of
bugs that we already know that we've got
that are being take a look at where if
ships go into a green zone they sort of
around a little bit in the catalyst we
find a fixed position before we do that
and then whatever happens we need to go
because we need to get this into the
server some health information so if we
do fix your issues tomorrow we know
whether performance wise we've been
doing lots of intestine increasing
player count so externally we got up to
60 players in an instance so that was
really really cool to see we've got a
lots of cool images of port olisar and
all the ships flying around it's really
really interesting to see the different
how even just a increasing player cap
like that can can make it feel a lot
more lived-in a lot more a lot more
exciting and internally we actually even
got up to 128 players so we're doing
lots of tests to try to increase player
player cap and it's going really well so
far
so we're winding down with the 3.0
release right now and that means that
some of the things that we're looking at
our stability and performance and this
is something that we're always concerned
with but when we're really approaching a
release that become
in priority and these are two kind of
broad topics stability is something that
like I said we're always addressing but
we've been fixing the obvious crashes
we've been fixing the obvious bugs and
disconnections and now we're getting to
a point where we've gotten through most
of the major issues and we're left with
either very difficult to solve crashes
or very difficult to reproduce and so
oftentimes I'll get some report from the
epic Adi and it will be that one time
during an avocado run there was a crash
on the server for some reason or
disconnection and I get a call stack I
get a core dump and there's no repro
we've only seen it once and we need to
fix it somehow and this has come up many
times I have to look at these kinds of
issues and just try to figure out how it
is even possible that say the server can
get in particular states and how to fix
it without ever seeing the crash and so
this requires a lot of collaboration for
instance with QA to get certain kinds of
information working with avocadoes so
that we can try a fix that may not hold
and and kind of go back and forth until
we get something that looks like it's
it's working and this is it's an ongoing
process and this is the kind of thing
we're having the Ewa Cod is incredibly
useful because it means that we can test
at a scale that we're just not able to
achieve internally so that's one big
kind of set of things that we're looking
at right now it's one of the few things
that we've been trying to do hard on 3.0
is optimization optimization
optimization you know we have bigger
Maps gigantic Maps a lot more players
and unfortunately a lot of our older
systems ran these updates all the time
which means if we throw in 60 ships
that's 60 big gigantic if' CFS updates
works our heavy physical beasts that eat
up all that yummy yummy cpu power and
obviously if you have a ship way down
there you don't care about him you only
care about the ships that are nearby
that you're combating or with your buddy
so we only want to update just the
things and I put in something it was
actually during bug smashers to only
show those ships that are nearby
unfortunately that had a knock-on side
effect where on the server if you had an
AI guy over here he wouldn't update and
he couldn't handle the mission so if you
go fly over he would eventually take on
and then teleport away no it caused
havoc so I had to build upon that
optimization so that it wasn't just in
range but if he detected him on the
sensor or for you know on the dedicated
server if he was a mission-critical
thing he should do an update so now we
only update things we should update
unless the server needs to do those
special little things and performance
and we get our fun CPU cycles one of the
other things we were doing on
optimization is we're trying to get rid
of a lot of our old systems there was
this thing called net serialized this is
basically the old way of the CryEngine
to serialize a bunch of data you
basically had this function it had a
block of information and you feel the
devil out but it doesn't work well what
their new system called serialize
variables the new way is multi-threaded
working in a batch all the great new
stuff of the day and that serialize main
thread a horrible flow set up so we're
trying to rip out that last thing we
only have three things left I used it we
ripped out two and we actually have a
third one getting worked on right now so
hopefully we could just toss away that
old system and use that awesome new
serialize variable flow and I think
Clyde will be very very happy once we
finish that off so performance has
gotten much better dies of late we've
managed to increase the average frame
rate in many places even really busy
places like grim X and Levski and but
we've we've managed to get more people
in more clients and at the same time we
went to evac RC with over 40 people not
long ago and we've even run local tests
using what we call headless clients
which is kind of what it sounds it's
basically just an automated way of
connecting clients and will usually we
actually had
I think it was ten or ten or twelve pcs
that we had each one were running about
seven to ten headless clients and we
managed to connect over a hundred
players not sure of the exact number but
managed to get over a hundred people and
at the same time with stability there's
an actual stable server with that many
people in so that was really exciting
for us
it's a Hitler and general performance is
better even localized as I say we've
we've gone through periods of time with
a frame rate has been sub 40 which is
when qh tends to get worried that's when
we will start throwing bugs and if like
we're seeing an average kind of FPS
below 30 in any area and yet almost all
of those areas are now pushing well over
30 into the mid forties high 50s it's
it's it's much much better performance
throughout our priorities at the moment
it to get build that is stable but also
has good player time features so we're
focusing on flight and traversal planet
Plumtree stuff landing missions there
shopping just to make sure all these are
functioning and to get out to a PT you
push in the hopes that no it's a good
experience when we do go to PT you as
you may recall last week our production
schedule showed we were at 179 remaining
must fix issues towards the release of
PT you across all categories I'm
thrilled to say that the result of all
the hard work by the team is that we
burned down enough issues to push 3.0 to
PT you to start a larger round of
testing now from here we'll be releasing
updates to more and more PT you testers
until we feel thorough improvements have
been completed then 3.0 will be released
live now don't forget to check out our
production schedule on Friday to see the
progress we're continuing to make and
see you next week here on burned down
while there's no feature today we do
have some very special video content
coming your way our anniversary special
starts tomorrow and to celebrate the
sale we've recorded eight episodes over
around the verse to profile all the ship
and vehicle manufacturers in-game
include a few surprises yes a few
surprises so be sure to check out our
website each and every day over the next
week so you don't miss an installment of
the series or your chance to pick up a
ship that's not normally available yes
that is right and thanks to all of our
subscribers and backers for your support
we couldn't do any of this without you
yes we definitely come so thank you very
much and for those of you in the United
States happy Thanksgiving to those
celebrating and thanks to our dedicated
testers out there playing the latest
build and getting it closer to
everyone's hands in 3.0 live yes thank
you and until tomorrow we will see you
