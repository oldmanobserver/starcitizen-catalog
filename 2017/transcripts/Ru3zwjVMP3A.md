everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host Mark eben I'm here to show
you some fun bug everyone we're here in
my fun little multiplayer test map and
my favorite ship Cutlass yeah and I have
a buddy who is also myself because why
not play on the same server as me
awesome so I'm I'm flying up there and I
muscle behind here because let's make
things confusing and as you can see his
UI is on whoa
I love random asset bugs so his you eyes
on everything's cool
I'm now gonna go run over get in the
side of the turret remember when you'd
sit coffee pinky up and you gotta make
sure you spill it all right so this
guy's in the turret he's going pew pew
pew having his time of his life his you
eyes on everything's dandy
and he decides to exit when the eggs
that happens his UI goes off and
unfortunately it turns off the pilots UI
ooh crap so not fun especially since
people are gonna get in and out of seats
and a multi cruise ship and we don't
want random screens turning off because
the guy in the back got out of his
turret what's happening well a long time
ago we made a decision when we
writing the SD item framework we forgot
to take into account a few things
oops basically we have these controllers
and we have items and we have the good
old players players take control of
controllers which then take subsequent
control items so the player will take
control of the weapon controller which
will then take control of some weapons
well in the case of the UI screens the
player is taking control of his
dashboard and the dashboard will observe
other things so that could promptly
display them on the UI unfortunately
when you have two
dashboards they kind of interfere with
each other because the UI for turning on
and off stuff is actually handled by the
controller's themselves so say we have
an energy controller which controls
power we have two dashboards and they
both want to watch it
fortunately the dashboard will let's see
let's go to drew rein online and let's
go to that magical function any time the
screen decides well the dashboard to say
I need to turn off something or anything
like that it will actually go to the
controller and tell it to turn on or off
so what that means if this guy the
dashboard has a power loss or the user
turns off all the screens it will go to
the energy controller and turn that off
which turns off this guy's UI because
the controller itself has DUI what we
need to do instead is make the
dashboards control that aspect because
all they want to know is the information
on the energy controller they don't care
if it's if that thing has controlled the
UI on or off so we need to separate a
bunch of fun code
so here is the awesome controllers
energy weapon you name it it's basically
this is the base class and any time here
it is we have it's this UI state that
gets toggled whenever it gets turned on
or
it gets attached this updates all the UI
states now we don't actually want this
to do any of that so we're gonna use the
good old magic delete key delete
everything there we go
deleted magic functions so we'll delete
this guy because we don't want tend to
control any more magical UI he has no
control of UI but now we need to make
the dashboard taking sole priority of
all these things so we got asically
gotta find all that area that we ripped
out so the first part is here we don't
need the controller's to turn everything
on we need to do it ourselves so what
we're gonna do I have this handy-dandy
code right here already pre-made because
I am lazy what this does is it will get
all the active screens that are on the
dashboard which is currently showing up
and it will toggle the power state based
on what the dashboard says it should be
so the UI is now controlled by the
dashboard so if this guy turns it off we
need to make sure only his stuff turns
off and that's what this beautiful thing
does right here and let's see what else
we have to change should be ha more
errors so since we're getting rid of
this part this is where we create our
screens and we already know for online
so we might as well pass this on to the
screen so when we're creating the
screens if dashboards already online we
need to make sure those screens are also
online so we need to make all of these
lovely things have that same information
let's go to that lovely
function there it is
ah so we are online passed through our
awesome C++ lambda and then pass it
where we do our register view shows I am
all right what else calls great view
this guy we need to see if we are also
online I think that's all I was copied
this guy do where did I put you there we
go sit there so now let's make sure we
have all the compile ah we don't need
this anymore
alright let's compile so what we have
done is the dashboard has its own online
power state we only need it to control
the UI screens themselves and not the
controllers so that way they could be I
mean it's it's like I have my desktop
right here I have three monitors and if
I turn them on and off I expect only
mine turn off and not Hosmer's back
there so compile all the things there we
are back after compiling and I got my
pilot in the seat and my co-pilot in the
back let's see his magical lo UI is
still on and now enter the turret the
dududududu coffee
as I am I'm gonna you know I'm gonna
turn off the power then I'm gonna eggs
it because why not go back to the other
guy and check it out
the UI's still on magic this guy slowly
gets out of the seat we and check it out
his UI still on everything is awesome
there you go
hope you guys enjoyed so we had a little
fun multiplayer bug there we're kind of
like when you old used to play an n64
and you were playing on that big old
television screen multiplayer
split-screen you turn off the screen
everyone's screen turns off not good
especially since what you see shouldn't
be what the other guy sees so fixed up
the code soothes the dashboard on this
side and the dashboard on this side are
independent of each other so whatever
you turn on on here won't affect this
guy over here
and that will make sure that the pilot
can fly and the guy and the turret could
get in and out without causing havoc
across the ship hope you guys enjoyed
until next time thank you for watching
