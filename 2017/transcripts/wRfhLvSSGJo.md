Hey everyone, welcome to Bug Smashers.
I'm your host, Mark Ament. I'm a senior
gameplay programmer here at Ciga and I'm
here to take you behind the scenes on
today's hottest bugs.
Bashes.
Hey everyone, we are here in Crusader
and I have two clients. Uh, client three
or he's number two and then client one.
The reason why it says two, three is
because the dedicated server is one then
two and three. So, I have my two clients
and I'm going to have the third guy
spawn a debug ship. Normally, I would
run up to a terminal and spawn a ship,
but because I am lazy and I don't feel
like running, I am going to spawn a uh
let's spawn a gladius.
Woo. So, I spawned a Gladius, and he'll
automatically get teleported into there.
Oh, love debug commands. And I have the
other client. Uh, let's see. We got to
go find where that ship is. Let's go to
light speed. There he is.
So,
so we have
the guy in the seat. Pretty pretty
standard stuff. And what we're now going
to do is go back over to the guy in the
seat.
Guy's running around. Run. And we are
going to disconnect.
Goodbye.
Let me remove this break point.
All right, let's disconnect.
And of course I will trigger break
points everywhere else because of other
debugging. But um so as this guy
processes its exit, let me explain uh
the bug and why we're here. Um there the
bug is basically um when you hit two
people or any number and one guy is in a
ship and he leaves when he comes back on
his machine.
getting up out of the bed, spawning into
the normal crusader area. But on
everyone else's machine, including um um
some guy watching it, like this guy
right here, he will spawn back into the
ship. And unfortunately,
everyone
um thinks he's in the ship except for
the server and that local player. Um
according to both of them, he's running
somewhere else around um Crusader doing
whatever he wanted to do. And now we
have a desync between all what the
remote players to see and what those two
the server and the local client sees.
And what that also means is you get some
weird oddities that allow you to kill
the player um in the ship when he's not
even there. He could be running around
and then he dies all a sudden because
well it's reporting the wrong spot.
So
once this guy has fully disconnected,
we'll see exactly what's going on.
Actually, it takes a little bit to
disconnect. So what we could look at is
in here in the player code, um, when he
gets deleted or destroyed, before that
happens, we have to do a bunch of
cleanup. And this particular section of
the code is when the player cleans up.
And as you can see here, when we clean
up, we're telling um uh the vehicle,
this is we call it the seat host because
shenanigans. Uh we basically tell the
vehicles uh we get all of his seats and
basically say, hey, evict everybody and
particularly evict this guy cuz he's
getting deleted. And the server is
supposed to tell everyone else, hey,
this guy's getting removed.
Um so it comes into this bit of code. on
on the server and it will run exit. But
if you notice, it's running this thing
called exit init. And exit initial
uh implementation to remove him from the
seat. This will play an animation or
teleport him to an exit position,
whatever it needs to do. It's the
implementation um that all clients will
run. However, it's not the code path
that set makes the server sell everyone
to run it. It's like, hey, this is the
stuff that they would be running. So
it's responsible for running the exit
code the actual implementation but not
actually dispatching it to letting
everybody know that hey I should exit
instead of running exit int our
implementation we should be running
nope exit.
Ah come on see exit
there if I could spell. There we go. We
should be running exit. Uh exit will run
the implementation.
Um it execute exit will do an animation
then eventually do execute exit but it
will also send the state to all the
remote machines. And since the server is
not going through this particular path,
it's just skipping it and just directly
removing him. All the remote machines
aren't knowing that this guy shouldn't
be in the seat anymore.
Uh so he's still processing his exit. Um
and
we shall go to reset. So ideally what
we'd want to do in here instead is
change this to exit so that it runs the
same sequence of events except it makes
sure it dispatch it to all the remote
clients.
All right. So now this guy's back.
So, this guy is still looking at the
ship with nobody in it. And we're going
to reconnect this guy in to see the bug.
And as we see the bug, um, what we want
to do to fix it,
let's check if we're the server.
Make sure we exit. And we want to skip
transitions because we don't want to
play an exit animation.
And we want to force it.
Now the other thing we could have done
is instead of in here where we uh
dispatch the uh the event uh we have all
the clients do it. So that way they
could also exit instead of having the
server tell them which is true except we
also want to make sure that the server
is authorative over everything
especially because of persistence and I
mean when we have the same entity IDs we
need to make sure that everyone's up to
date and not just because some guy
thinks a certain state should be in. So
having the server dictate these things
is always a a bonus. Now, there is code
elsewhere that handles
um removing the player properly when
he's in the seat, but it won't correctly
reset his um entity ID. And that's why
we need the server to tell everyone that
this is the case,
especially since um before we delete the
entities, it's up to the server to say
which stuff was deleted. So, if the
server says, "Hey, remove this guy from
the seat." followed by delete him. Then
we ensure um all the clients have the
same uh logic.
Let's load the level.
All right. So, this guy spawned in. He
thinks he's in the bed. Server thinks
he's in the bed. However, that other
client thinks he's attached.
And he even has broken animations. So
from the perspective of um the the
remote clients, this would be everyone
and this guy, they're out of sync.
So let's give it a try with our fix and
see what happens.
Compile. Compile. Compile.
See, this is the part they don't show
you all the time. Yeah, we might fix a
bug, but it takes a few bit of time to
compile everything, restart all the
servers, verify the fix, then give it to
QA, make sure they verified it, and then
hopefully a day or two later it gets in
or a new bug arises because we just
uncovered another thing that this thing
was hiding.
Ah, game design, art development.
All right, we are back in business. So,
let's
fast forward. Spawn the gladius
all over. And the other guy
use magical cheats
to fast forward. Let's see. Where did he
spawn? There he is.
[Music]
All right. So, there he is. Now we're
going to exit.
Bam. Sorry, I walked out.
Now we are processing the exit. So the
server will tell all the remote clients,
hey, this guy has left.
As you can see, he left.
And
The other guy is slowly leaving. And I
just realized
um
that true actually enables uh
transitions where we don't want
transitions on. All right. And just to
be extra safe um before committing to be
available, we will remove that. And what
this will do is
um allow the local client to perform
this as well. However, the server will
still dictate the exit so that um the
local client will make sure he's in that
state and just to reinforce it, the
server will say, "Hey, flush it." And
with those two things, the bug will be
good to go. And
once this guy
Oh, no. client two
um disconnects. We'll reconnect them and
we'll see that he's no longer in the
seat when he reconnects and he's in fact
in his little cubby hole on all
machines.
All right, as you guys see, he connected
fully and he's no longer in the ship.
So, bugs fixed, problem solved. Hope you
guys enjoyed. until next time's exploit.
So, as you guys saw, we had a little uh
bit of a bug on this the server where
when a guy was leaving a server and he
is inside of a seat, uh the server would
remove him from the seat and wouldn't
tell anyone else about it. Um we have
everything being server authorative. So
if server doesn't tell the clients or
remote clients that something happened,
uh things get a little bit wonky. And
because that server didn't tell everyone
else that this guy left the seat, um
everyone else thought he was still
there. And once he rejoined, since we
have persistent um numbers for what our
players are, our entity IDs, um everyone
else thought he was still in the seat
when he reconnected. So all the other
remote machines thought he was still in
those um uh previous seat. And even
though he was like maybe miles away from
re when he rejoined and from a
perspective he's still in the vehicle
but he's not now the server correctly
informs everyone that he has left and
now everyone sees that he has
successfully left the seat. So when he
reconnects he won't be in there and then
that can't be used as an exploit. Well,
hope you guys enjoyed. Until next time.
