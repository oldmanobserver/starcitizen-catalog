## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm controller on today's
episode we dive into the moby glass and
show off the numerous features and
functions you will be using in game yeah
we're excited to show you the awesome
work the UI team has done but before
that it's time for a new segment called
burn down in the run-up to 3-0 we're
going to provide you at the behind the
scenes access to the developers as they
battle various bugs and blockers
currently affecting the release of 3.0
now let's see what issues made this
week's burn down
welcome to burn down our new weekly show
dedicated to reviewing progress on
issues blocking a release of star
citizen alpha 3.0 if you saw our update
to the public release schedule last
Friday you should notice that we started
this week at ninety must fix issues that
we need to complete before we're ready
to release to our first round of non CI
G testers these 90 issues are our
detailed lists with set priorities
guiding the close down phase of this
release the reason we need priorities is
to help us understand which are crucial
to be completed first we currently use
terms and definitions such as blocker
critical high moderate and trivial and
identifying these issues I'll start with
QA
so in QA whenever a new feature comes
online testers always look at their
shops because these are really gonna be
able to do a lot of work we're going to
be able to take someone's special baby
that they've been working on as a new
feature for weeks and weeks and weeks
and we basically tell them their baby is
ugly when you collect developer tears as
we like to call it because we're able to
fill the database with new jiriz which
we may have noticed in the last couple
of weeks when we took early looks at it
and now the gloves are off and we're
finally able to bug up everything done
from QA on 3.0 build which has tried to
was attempted to be done on friday and
also saturday but it seems as a crush on
boot on the 3.0
that issue is sat with Gordon at the
moment so once I get out of here I'll
follow up see how that's going and we
didn't from the cover even from the
comment on the bug it didn't seem like a
very particularly difficult one to fix
up so just want to find out where we're
up to on that and getting new 2.0 bills
kicked off sort of queue I can do a
sanity check on it that'll be mostly
checking to make sure that all the areas
of the games load the business single
obvious missing like most the entirety
of the Stanton map for example or Paula
saw some time so we implemented rotating
planets it really changed everything
that was going on the world
the helpers got turned around so what
happened was as you would spawn and all
this are and you end up going through
the geometry of all the star itself
because you were waking up backwards
instead of coming out of the bed you
were going into the bed
I fear the more serious open issue right
now or memory related issues various
client crashes spawning multiple ships
simultaneously from the ship spawn
terminal causes an undefined error
insurance and repair will deduct
currency but not actually repair that
seems bad we've got so many checklists
for the 3.0 release like we've got I
mean I've got probably like 10 pages of
checklist they're very specific and it's
just a case of all the red on pick boxes
we just want to get them all green
primarily we have we have several
reviews through the week because
obviously we work in several time zones
and several studios so they need to be a
high level of transparency with what
with what every departments doing we're
lucky enough to have tech design in the
UK with John crew and his team so we
pretty much kind of speaking to each
other on an hourly basis my guys what's
going on there we're testing the dentate
designers as a group and even though the
building had had absolutely no UI you we
still had an amazing time as a group
navigating our way around while the
asteroid fields trying to find a landing
spot on yellow and with no UI you had to
do it by communication and just signal
so firing flares off firing weapons and
listening for where everyone was and
that was quite an amazing experience you
know we're just sort of neck deep in
future development right now so you know
we've got a lot of stuff
but it's it's still kind of rough around
the edges
today we're working on the rover trying
to make sure it's got all the features
that it needs to and make sure it's
behaving the way it's supposed to like
currently we got some areas with the
wheels not quite working right we don't
have the LEDs hooked up for the tires so
it looks like it's driving around on
these big boxy wheels I was just like
hey I got my rover and I jumped in it
started riding around near lefty and I
hit a bump and then my hubcaps fell off
it just hit so I just hit some collision
looks like it oh they're already
detaching yeah they're already attaching
it it's not very visible this was not as
visible as it'll but yeah you can see
that they're not I see they're not
aligned blend anymore yeah so right here
and right here they're not aligned
anymore but these are still fine and as
you can see so it's fun bug like maybe
maybe I didn't buy this Rover and a they
didn't buy it new lot it's not it's an
email to directors saying a person
whereas the rover including satellites
response it making clear that we do this
I didn't to put it there maybe when we
do ship test them mm-hmm the way that
it's done normally nowadays is a test on
one chip to try it with the different
manufacturers give gain wide issue or
it's just something to do with the
manufacturer or very ship specific
because we've got 50 ships in the game
at the moment doing every single ship
that just come through a 2.0 conversion
is excessive at best so I think all you
can kind of hope for the moment
basically issues in one by one we hope
that they're caught up which is what
I've just call that neither support a
note that is not recasting comparable to
the ships so people find it in another
ship you can find that issue and rather
than trying to do it over and over and
over again later on in the week what
we're probably going to be switching up
the text animations such as the
following animation which have gotten a
lot of attention lately has sort of
comedic effect where you'd be stuck in a
following animation when you're just
jumping up you'd immediately go into a
following animation when you create a
number of different issues
depending upon where you were whether if
you're in it within a ships physics grid
where you were on the station or you
want to plan it sometimes you could get
stuck in a following animation sometimes
all the AI would be stuck in a falling
animation you'll go through this process
of things being kind of broken for an
awful long time you kind of work with
that it's like the old saying goes if
you want to make an omelet you go you've
got to scramble some eggs right now
we're making solid progress on issues as
they clap up but there's still more work
to be done we've currently knocked out
32 issues and added 20 leaving 78
remaining as vincent explained you don't
always know what's going to happen when
you bring features together but as we're
completing and polishing features those
numbers will change dramatically
sometimes higher sometimes lower beyond
our JIRA task and our bug count another
interesting metric we try to keep a
close eye on is our check-ins or change
lift into perforce these represent the
work our developers are doing and
checking into our revision control
system now in one week we've checked in
1892 times across the entire company now
the reason that number is so high is
because we're all still working in our
game dev branch now this branch has
everything across both squadron 42 and
star citizen now we've already generated
our 3.0 branch which has currently 3676
open items which includes the 78 months
ticked issues and we will begin shifting
our developers over in the very near
future then we'll lock the branch down
and keep a close eye on what needs to be
fixed to make a stable release to burn
down now once we've done that you'll see
this number dwindle week by week until
we're ready to release and with quality
as our top priority we're going to keep
pushing hard to get this release out as
quickly as possible so come back next
week to keep up to date on the burn down
so I hope you enjoyed that look at some
of the issues we're currently facing in
3.0 check back next week see the
progress we've made what we've managed
to burn down and if any new bugs over
their head which probably will have done
now it's time to lift our arm and open
our mull be glass this important device
will be your primary access point to
many of the game's features including
the star map inventory list contract
manager and so much more that's right
the mobi glass was intended to fill
their almost people's smartphones occupy
today
that came unique set of challenges and a
lot of hard work but as you'll see the
payoff will be more realistic and
immersive game for further details let's
check in with UI creative director Shane
yen and team
so as always there's a plethora of
features that Bui team has been working
on one of those features has been the
multi glass and we've been kind of
overhauling that over the course of the
past few months we had done some
preliminary concept work last year
working closely with our systems design
team to design something that would
assume something more can do what you
would find in a typical desktop OS
however what we really needed was a few
key pieces of tech that would really
make it worthwhile without us having to
write a ton of bespoke
code and functionality one of those was
what we call the render to texture tech
and that's something that the graphics
team has been working on and providing
us so we are essentially now integrating
this tech with all of our UI across the
board including the mobile glass so
you'll find this eventually in ship
displays shopping terminals kiosk and so
forth so the key effect that this
provides us is that it enables us to
render a 3d scene whether it's a video
comm call feed or an image
representation of a item in game but
we're able to render that on a either a
2d screen or actually within a 3d hollow
volume so in both cases it's actually
the same exact display tech being used
we don't have to write bespoke code to
display a UI or a 3d representation in a
3d volume versus a 2d one so this allows
us to have things like 3d holograms of
ships and sort of mini maps and the star
map and so forth rendered on two screens
in game and it looks much more proper
than other than it would otherwise you
know in our game we have a lot of
different environmental archetypes that
we need to account for when you're
traveling across the universe you will
come across environments that are more
technologically dated and ones that are
more technologically progressed so this
extends to a lot of different things
including you know their style of
architecture their style of clothing the
devices that they use the goods and so
forth and for the UI in particular this
affects us and that we need to design
our UI based on that archetypes
in a more lower tech environment we can
just display the UI on flat 2d panel
displays so for a more technologically
advanced setting that's where we sort of
bring in our 3d holographic style of UI
and so the mobile glass in particular is
manufactured by this corporation called
micro Tech and they actually manufacture
all of the handheld devices in the
universe so naturally they're very
high-tech so you would find in the mobi
glass that is a holographic projection
so the mobi glass assumes a very crucial
role on the universe and that it serves
as the primary access point to all the
different game mechanics and
transactions player communication and so
forth so sort of akin to what we have in
smartphones in today's world that's
basically what mobile glasses and star
citizen that's kind of how we designed
it to be on the universe you know you
have a home screen which has various
widgets which provide you sort of added
Gallants information but we have all
these dedicated apps which there's very
specific purposes in the game world
things like managing mission contracts
customizing your loadouts
viewing maps and so forth and so on it's
designed to be this sort of very direct
link to your player character as well as
the surrounding environment so if you
wanted to know more information about
yourself or the kind of outside
environment that's what you infer from
the home screen widgets so if you wanted
to check what is my current oxygen level
or what's the current atmosphere
composition outside or the atmospheric
pressure is it safe to take off my
helmet is it safe to walk around outside
without a suit and if not do I have
enough oxygen to make it to the next
destination or where I'm trying to get
to like what is the state of the health
of my character am I hurt in any way or
what is the state of my mission
objectives that I currently have tracked
how much money do I have and all of
these questions can be answered through
the use of the mobile glass because
we're doing all this new work on the
mobi glass and the screens and stuff we
really wanted to also upgrade the model
of it the mobi glass is essentially a
watch and it's a completely different
element than any of the screens or any
of the buttons that you actually push on
it so and
we had a little bit of free rein but we
also want to make it we knew that we
wanted to make it smaller and more dream
lines so that it could fit with
everything and we didn't have to adjust
to many of our other assets but we also
didn't want to rein in and constrict
ourselves for later too so that's why
I've got much smaller the mobis last
model you've seen for a long time is
getting a little old and we want to
update it with not one version but
actually two versions because as you've
seen in some of the previous character
videos before we've been updating our
modular system for all our clothes and
our armor this meant that the mobi glass
is going to have to change as well
because you have all these different
versions of jackets in shirts and things
that are going to be able to take on and
off and show the undershirt or maybe the
over shirt or a jacket or a suit they
really need to fit and be kind of an
all-in-one solution what we would date
is we made the new movie class much
thinner and much smaller to accommodate
that we didn't want to go through
running through any of these weird tech
restrictions where maybe you have a
jacket that covers the mobi glass and to
see that you'd have to pull the sleeve
back and that gets just gets really
complicated so we want to make sure that
the players can see the mobi glass at
any time it wasn't that complicated to
do it was mostly a little bit of a
redesign Jeremiah Lee one of our concept
artists here did a 3d concept so we
could really easily and quickly see it a
civilian mobi glass is the one that
you'll be wearing in clothes and then
the military version is going to be the
one that you wear in your under suits
and your armor something that's a little
bit more rugged and it's going to be for
combat use so one of the biggest
challenges I'm doing the new movie class
was the modular system for clothing in
the armor so because the modular system
is the main reason that we had to redo
the mobi plans we had to go through all
the different options of the different
types of clothes you're going to be
wearing long sleeves and jackets and
under suits and that was where we really
figured out that's something that was
thinner was going to be better than
something that was thick and bulky but
also where we realized that some of our
current assets might have to be just it
if we made it really thin and it fit
with some assets that was great but
other ones might have to be pulled back
so you could see it all the time we
really want to make sure that's
available for access because it's cool
to see but also it adds a little bit of
level of detail where everybody's
wearing one and everybody has them often
everybody is eventually gonna build a
customized to show how much you've spent
on your mobile glass or how expensive it
is or what brands you got we want to
make each application very robust for
the specific functionality that it's
meant to serve in game but on top of
that we want to introduce the ability
for players to personalize his or her
mobile glass such that it's more
contextually relevant to his or her
common tasks that another player might
not actually care so much about so for
instance on the home screen you have all
these different widgets that you
eventually be able to customize as we
start adding more and more functionality
in game then we would kind of fit be
able to fit on the on the home screen so
that's that I kind of idea behind that
so fundamentally the mobile glass is a
diegetic we projected UI and what this
means is that the UI is meant to be seen
by not just you as the player but also
is meant to be visible by your in-game
character as well so basically your
player character is aware of the UI just
as you as a player are aware of it
through through your screen and we do
this for a couple of reasons one is
because the fact that we retain the
visual connection between your player
character and the UI makes it much more
immersive to use because we will be a we
are capable game we're kind of forced to
project the UI in 3d space because
otherwise it just wouldn't work you know
in a traditional flat 2d menu you know
you just you just want to be able to
read it so you need to project it at
some sort of distance away for exact
should be usable so we sort of do that
from the get-go and that's sort of
always been our driving paradigm in UI
design in general for all the advantages
that a diegetic we projected UI has we
as UI designers sort of lose a bit of
control and flexibility in terms of you
know being able to adjust the UI you
know the UI in general so at the mercy
of the display geometries and animations
and so forth so if we need to change
something it's not necessarily the UV is
just adjusting something on our end and
calling it resolved we actually need to
work really closely with the other
departments to ensure that the UI is
usable so working with animation working
with the art teams working with gameplay
engineers to make sure that the user
experience isn't hamper
negatively so in UI design you can only
subvert player expectations so much
before they find your UI clunky
frustrating or unusable something we
absolutely don't want in our game a good
rule of thumb we'll use is that you
should only be focusing on and changing
one unique angle of your UI to ensure
that the core components of the of the
rest of the system remain understandable
and within the expectations of the
player so what I mean is that the main
thing you'll see with the mobi glass
that differs from traditional UI systems
is that we made it as Dai jeddak as
possible making sure it was immersive
and stayed grounded in the game world so
things like attaching it to your wrist
movement tilting it back a little bit
and adding visual effects to make it
look like a real object in the world and
not just something sitting on top of the
game world the visual design style and
user experience of the interface itself
while interesting is fairly
straightforward simple line art and
shape language basic color schemes and
compact information light layouts again
this is because we felt we if we created
an overly unique visual style coupled
with the digestive Miss already it would
be kind of like sensory overload and
would actually inhibit usage and
usability and as with all UI especially
in gaming that's the goal we're always
trying to strive for how can I make
something visually interesting and
unique fun to use but also make it
immediately understandable to a new user
putting the UI in the game world comes
with a unique set of challenges it's not
just the UI sitting in a silo and it's
on top of the game and it's an
afterthought it's something that needs
to be integrated with animation with
audio with the VFX team so it's super
rewarding to work with all those
different teams and be able to build a
system together instead of just working
with the UI team alone what we do in
terms of audio is obviously not trying
to break the immersion that deep
different artists that put in the work
but instead we try to and that's that
play experience by addressing them
sonically so one of the first things we
did was basically sitting down with Zane
and we went through different concepts
that were done for the MOBA class as
well as is listening to different
references as well as music as we wanted
to create a soundscape whenever bring
the mobis us up so that we could emerge
to play in a more soothing stage what
came out of them
that we wanted to keep the player not
just the feeling of using sci-fi to like
suffer a sci-fi futuristic tool but we
also want to give the player the feeling
of using an actual electronic device so
you know visually we would have the
screen flickering or different images
distorting as well every now and then so
in order to address that we use coil
pickup microphone and what's really
particular about this microphones is
that they do not reduce sun waves into
its own electric signals but instead
we're able to capture those
electromagnetic fields created by
electric devices so you can actually
hear our disk of our computer working or
you killed
you can basically hear like your mobile
phone working under the hood and things
of that and that really helped us to
bring that extra layers of reality when
adding them to more cynthy tones one of
those challenges basically trying to
emerge the player into a different state
so usually you know like usually when
you are in a specific area you will have
you would hear ambience it would hear
like whole different things happening
around you but again we also wait to
create something like another state like
on a soothing moment whenever using the
mobile glass so creating a soundscape
like another role ambiences for that it
was something that I've been trying to
do and read or reduce you more and more
times just to basically trying to make
it more interesting and and relaxing
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
so another challenge is that because we
are a first-person game we don't
necessarily see much of a character and
frame except if you're for instance to
look down at your feet I mean at the
same time we need to be able to make it
apparent that your character is aware of
the UI so how do we do that and that's
one of the reasons why we've always
opted to have the arm visible on screen
is because that's the visual connection
between the UI and the character so the
interesting thing about the starmap and
where we want to take in the future is
that the star map will actually be the
same display text being used for the
radar and you can sort of think the star
map as sort of like a google maps of the
star citizen universe
it's basically we eventually want to
make it whereby you can zoom in far
enough and it basically turns into a
radar in a ship or your surroundings
like who's who's around me if I'm when
first-person we've initially showed us
the star map at Gamescom last year which
is was basically to be able to quantum
travel to a location but since then
we've actually iterated on it heavily
we've done a sprint for the star map
which involved VFX gameplay engineering
audio and so forth to really drive this
UI to the next level so we have all
kinds of new effects in the star map
we've iterated on the user experience of
the star map and just made it much more
visually impressive than it was you know
even just a few weeks prior the star map
is the first implementation of the world
display system the world display system
basically allows us to preview different
kinds of data from different kind of
sources so these different kind of
sources could be radar navigational day
data could be ships people on your radar
could be celestial objects could be all
kinds of data and the thing about the
world display system is that we can
preview it and zoom zoom in on it as a
matter of it rotate around it so
displayed so that we have like a whole
view of whatever we want to show this
dar map is a very good implementation of
that because it shows planets stars
system galaxies you can zoom into
stations stuff like that later on we'll
be able to show area information
minimaps maybe even implement the radar
into the same star map so if you zoom in
you'll see radar data like blips of
different vehicles different ships on
your radar and if you zoom out you'll be
able to see the navigational data of
celestial objects of for example a star
your planets moons and that's but like
that's the basic of the world display
system for the star map have been mainly
involved in working on the Polish of the
star map that involves getting some good
navigation inside your star map so if
you zoom in zoom out if you rotate
yourself use right mouse input feels
very smooth and feels like the user
experience is right for your star map
I've also been working on the animations
like little animations when you when the
star map pops and like this everything
zooms in it feels kind of animated it
gives a little bit of an extra edge on
the star map and the visuals so the
visuals i've been working on as well as
like adding some kind of backdrop lines
and different kind of stuff to make the
star Mike look better the biggest code
challenge for getting star map to work
is kind of translating the positional
data of the world so your planets are
somewhere in this large universe and
these have to be kind of translated into
this very small screen it's a very basic
game kind of problem but it's kind of
hard to get it right I guess because you
have to work with transforms and the
rotation the translation and the scaling
of your objects you have to
make these big objects and kind of
compress them into this small screen you
have to structure your code very well
in order to get like the results you
want that like these big objects are
these small things on your display so
we've also done a revamp of the emission
manager app which we've actually now
named the contracts manager and the
contracts manager is the mobi glass app
which manages all missions between
mission givers in the PU as well as
eventually player-created missions the
app is now split amongst a number of
different screen flows the first one
being the available contract screen
which is where you'll be able to view
all available contract opportunities
within your particular area view the
details of each contract such as the
reward and who it was posted by as well
as explicitly accept those contracts as
well we have a pending screen also which
displays the particular contracts which
have been sent to you directly via the
game or in conversation say for instance
when you're in a meeting with a mission
giver like Mars Eckhart players can then
accept or reject these contracts you
then also have a particular screen which
displays the contracts which you've
accepted and from here you'll be able to
view all the dynamically generated list
of objectives for each particular
contract as well as track or abandon
those contracts a contract history
screen will allow players also to review
the ones which you've previously
completed or failed later down the line
we want to introduce another screen in
the app which will allow players the
ability to actually create their own
contracts and post it on the available
contracts board another application
which will be we will be introducing is
the inventory manager which will allow
players the ability to view all items
that their character has in possession
across the stars in universe you know
from small antique coins all the way up
to something more significant like say a
capital a large capital ship so you make
it easier to navigate amongst
potentially thousands of items players
can specify a filter and also items can
be sorted and searched amongst another
purpose of this app will be to allow the
ability for players to transfer items
from one cargo box to another or from
ship to ship as long as both the origin
and destination are in the same relative
location this F along with many others
like the contracts manager in the star
map will play crucial role
in aiding the various professions like
mining trading transport and so forth so
as you can see we have a lot in
development for the upcoming release a
lot of a new apps that we're doing on
top of the general overhaul in the
mobile glass so what you'll see you is
basically a very initial feature set in
all of these different apps and we'll be
continuing to expand on this going
forward you know introducing more robust
features and more robust functionality
for additional gameplay mechanics that
will eventually be introduced I'm kind
of excited to get this into the players
hands and and seeing what they think of
it so in last week's feature we
highlighted how we're using the render
to texture tech to create holograms and
calm calls in real time now you got to
see it in use with the mobi glass it
just goes to show how all our new
features are really coming together ya
know they definitely are and one thing
I'd like to mention is I saw a few
what's so special you can rated the
texture and lots of engines or even
DirectX after we showed the show last
week and my answer is yes that is
correct if that was all we were doing
but the key thing is our ability to open
up an arbitrary number of secondary
views on to the world and render them to
a 2d texture or more importantly
holographically into a 3d volume inside
the main rendering pipeline and I don't
know of any engine that currently
supports the second part of what RTT
does so lots of people cheat with tricks
like placing a character model with a
special shader directly into the scene
to make it look like a hologram and
that's how our movie would achieve the
sort of hologram effect we seen
something like Star Wars
we actually broadcast in 3d to of
volumes somewhere in the game and that's
super cool so there you go I did graph
being able to digest we render the
mobile be glass interface inside the
world including holographic versions of
your character ship or items that have
simply sending you to a menu screen was
a goal of ours from the beginning and
I'm really happy that we're getting
there is fantastic now say that all
backwards super fast that's all for
today's episode a big thanks to all of
our subscribers your support is what
makes shows like a TV bug smashers
lawmakers and citizen of the star as
possible there's also a new happy hour
game dev tomorrow at 12 p.m. Pacific
this time members of the lore team
joined the show to discuss their process
and ask you for help in crafting lore
that could appear in a future post
cool finally thanks to all our backers
making this game has been an incredible
journey and still ongoing and one that's
only been made possible by your
continued feedback and support so thank
you very much thank you very much and
until next week we will see you around
