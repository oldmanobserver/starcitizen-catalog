hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm Sandi
Gardiner and I'm Steve bender
welcome back sandy how was games come
last week James comers pretty cool I had
a lot of fun it was a great way to spend
time with the backers and it's always
cool to see how enthusiastic they are
and plus the booth looks amazing and it
was busy very very busy with like
lineups well we've got a great show
lined up for today including a feature
that goes behind the scenes at Gamescom
but first it's time to check in with the
dev team on our 3.0 progress let's see
what bugs have been smashed and which
new ones flared up in this week's burn
down burn down welcome back to burn down
our weekly show dedicated to reviewing
progress on issues blocking the release
of star citizen alpha 3.0 last week we
ended at 67 total must fixed issues that
were prioritized at 7 blockers 36
criticals 20 highs for moderates and
zero trivial x'
so let's see how this week went so one
of the things that most studios do and
we do here in Los Angeles is we have
triage weekly where we go through the
bugs we've got in and we assess what
their impact is what their value for the
fix is and more importantly what we can
do in in what order we can accomplish
things to support the long-term goals of
3-0 currently we have the spring going
for quantum travel experience and the
turrets experience as well which I
believe I've mentioned before we want to
make sure that quanta travel and tour
it's both to a level where with the item
2.0 implementation of these of these
things we want to make sure that they're
properly reflecting how it is we want to
have them in the game and where we
envisage them going further in the
future so we have current sprints active
for those at the moment to make sure
that that is all working and tied
together nicely
similarly for the cockpit experience as
well that ranges from everything from
g-force reactions hit reactions when
you've been shot at
- the general interaction around in the
cockpit itself a lot of things are
almost completed in terms of emissions
but I've cancer stage where I'm blocked
by a lot of issues you know if the
emissions like 85 percent completed or
ready for a review but these extra
couple of blockers would just push
what's new for the line and we've got
I've got prioritized JIRA's out for that
would jean already the mission system is
gonna be under review with the directors
in the coming days - to see what the
progress has been on the emissions that
we currently have and getting feedback
of how on the mission flow various steps
how they play out and any feedback that
is then received from them we'll have to
evaluate that and come to an agreement
with them and how much we're able to get
done and how long that will take
and then from that we see how much how
much work is is remaining based on their
feedback then I thought I'd show a buck
I've been working on for through my nose
it's about a week old and bug is the
airlocks need moving down slightly
because since you're standing here as a
player you wouldn't be pressing like the
animations for pressing this panel
wouldn't actually hit the panel itself
it would hit somewhere below here
because you'd be standing on a much
lower elevation so the bug request for
is for the Alex to be moved down or
everything else could be moved up so
it's a pretty clear case of one way or
the other
yeah solve this problem of the elevation
being different so this is a classic
case of where you could do it do it the
right way which then would be to move
everything up as you see here or
everything down but where if you would
do that there would be so many
implications of you accidentally causing
other problems but people because you
sit in in here there's a vaulting mark
up there are loads of volumes visit
areas there are loads of things going on
and if we see on the outside there's the
same width it's like lots of assets
there's AI going around here there are
navmesh is all kinds of things that you
don't want to accidentally break for
someone else you know - cause
even more work so that's a good case
that where you have to sort of break the
rules of what's conventionally good in
games in game development and cannot go
for the simple opportunities you build a
little stupid around so that the players
don't stand on the floor they stand on
the ramp and the animations play
correctly and finally as that was I mean
III solved that book and then it turns
out that there was another existing bug
not to do with content or art in any way
exactly in this area ways obviously
here's a video of this bug where when
the player goes here you see they start
they start freaking out here that
there's clearly something happen in the
end like that there's bouncing something
physical just in this area sort of
happening and affecting the player and
this bug was then passed around to
programming talk of network issues to
maybe being the course it was very
localized like no one could figure out
exactly why is it happening here and
then this submit goes in and well on
results both bugs somehow so the good
case of a happy accident development so
what I'm working on is we had a metrics
update for the shopkeep counter and the
shop container is going to be used
everywhere that can be used for selling
clothes it can be used for you know
selling plants or you know weapons
things like that so there's going to be
a lot of common use so we want to make
sure that that that the performances and
the metrics are matching what we're
gonna do is we've decided that we're
going to take the the standing touch
screen for the for the counter and we're
going to scoot that forward a little bit
so that there is just there's room for
the performer performances with so they
could lean on the counters and they can
but they can also type so there's like a
nice compromise between the two it'll be
a new metric and it'll be different than
the stand alone
standing console which we already have
established so this will be another
another version that just works better
with the shopkeep we're burning down
bugs left and right just recently we ran
into an issue with miles Eckhart and one
of the mission givers that we're we're
gonna have in 300 miles Eckhart was was
instead of sitting at the bar of the bar
the table like he was supposed to
we found him curled up in the fetal
position in the corner so some reason
he'd had too much to drink and guess
that day or something because he was not
working was supposed to be so that was a
fun one to kind of duplicate try to
figure out required a lot of back and
forth between Rob Reiner girly designer
here Francesco or leader of AI
programmer in Frankfurt you know some of
the networking guys like it's just it's
a it's a lot of the issues that we're
running into or having to coordinate a
lot with people from all over the the
company to in order to solve because
it's not just a simple design issue or
simple art issue it's kind of a
combination thereof there's rarely a
feature that is developed solely in one
place or on one team so it requires a
lot of a lot of coordination between
teams for sure the burndown rights are
always high but that's just kind of
indicative of game development the more
we tend to resolve the more we tend to
uncover new issues so there bugs created
always rises but that's not necessarily
a bad thing because at the same time
when we're fixing up issues we're able
to get the Polish done fix the bugs and
then watch the burn rate increase where
we are now we're getting closer
obviously with software and with games
development it's really hard to tell
where you are exactly at because the
things that really can get you in the
hamstrings are the unknown bugs and the
crashes with low reproducibility all the
bugs that we fix with the mission giving
and with being able to go down to a
procedural planet and pick up the boxes
and be able to complete those missions
is directly going to impact three-arm
reduces the workload that we now have to
do to be able to release 3:02 you guys
our backers it's not a direct sprint
it's you know we've got to go around the
circuit to get there
but we can see it now and it's being
able to realize it there will be bugs
before we get there how big they are
you know yet to be determined but we are
there we can see it and it's now just
being able to focus in and hone into
that release so that you guys can play
three out so at the time of filming this
we've added 27 to our must fix list and
checked in 768 updates to our 3.0 branch
this week that means we're at 94 issues
stopping the release to our first round
of non CI G testers as Gamescom occurred
this week we had the unique opportunity
for what ended up being over 2,000
attendees playing our planetary
experience which as you know houses a
lot of the new changes coming with SEL
43.0 now this did end up increasing the
influx of MOSFETs issues for the better
as it helped us find some issues that
may not have occurred until after our
first release so as the goal every week
is to burn down we're going to keep
working to push that number downward as
fast as possible so come back next week
to keep up to date on burn down remember
burn down isn't the only way for you to
follow our work on 3.0 you can also
check out the production schedule on our
website we update it every week with
further details on various bugs and
blockers affecting 3.0 as we mentioned
earlier the star citizen team spent last
week at Gamescom we streamed live from
the show floor let people play a part of
our 3.0 build and revealed an exciting
new partnership with face where
technologies at our annual games con
presentation but that's just the stuff
you saw a ton of work went on behind the
scenes to get everything ready for the
show floor as well as Friday's event
let's take a look I am here at the show
floor booth that games come 2017
[Music]
we were doing press demos on Wednesday
and Thursday which we had about six
people on instead of the twelve we had
for the big one and so that's a little
bit of times always we're working
through some of the King so though you
know some of the crashes of sometimes we
Adam sometimes we do every new build
comes to us like new little boxy and
there so we get the latest build and
usually QA did a good job like to
pre-screen the build but sometimes run
into an issue and let me try to like fix
it on site as as soon as we can
we have an important announcement to
make DJ night visibility perilously to
his death we don't know how long it's
gonna take for him to land the ground
but his options don't look good we are
here at the star citizen booth from the
gamescom show floor and it is packed
[Music]
there's so many people around here
people queuing down there down there and
uh yeah and they can play we put up
everyday on the floor you know we found
issues we what people were playing was
live it was raw all right first day
Tuesday people playing we found bugs
those went back we calculated them
Wednesday morning new-build
so I'm there helping with the IT and
everything else coordinates push the
bills let's get going and then I will
try atmospheric reentry
because that's the stuff that we all are
waiting for yes the graphic details are
stuff awesome I think my experience was
very great I can fly around two planets
I experienced like two ships that I
never experienced before
[Music]
so once we knew what we want wanted to
do being a designer I was first working
on setting up a lot of the AI in Leske
and then after that basically got pulled
into practicing the flow with six people
that were actually available in in
Frankfurt we need to send an audio feed
via headphones so the gamers the players
of the the demo can hear their own sound
but also send it by HDMI to the AV guys
which then pass it to the PA system
which is the live mix of when people are
watching it at the glory theatre but
then also isolating each element of that
so I can send a different mix to the
stream I hope things don't crash
sometimes they do and then you gotta try
to decide what the best way to to
recover from that but no I'm not
generally nervous at all it's more just
you've got all this adrenaline getting
it all together and then BAM go through
the presentation it's done
[Music]
what does it take to build a symphony it
takes a blueprint
four movements that will dictate key
[Music]
tempo and the arrangement of musical
notes that will create harmonies
[Music]
a feeling so powerful that it transcends
words
they must be conveyed in another form
introducing the new 600 ah from origin
Symphony in motion
and without further ado I am going to
introduce the man who you've all been
waiting for
Chris Robert good to see you guys
tonight
we having fun yeah we thought that
perhaps we should just get straight in
to a demo you can't give an admission
wait you're a guy yeah why not
I wanted to try some something different
[Applause]
what do you think of my look okay so
hold on guys
so one thing that we're going to show
here this is a feature that we've put
into the game it's not going to be in
3.0 but it will be soon afterwards two
things one which is standard me VIP and
the other is what we call face over ap
[Music]
and I get far enough away from and as
you can see the space landscaping is
much better than it was in 2.6 when I
look down we see the big crater
so now we're heading today mom
so you see crusader actually off to the
rides as we head up Monday mom
that's about
especially stuck in the policy no chumps
machine crash all right sorry guys the
pilots machine crash which is why I
disappeared at the milliner jump I did
warn you they potentially had some
crashes in there on foot that was that
was that was that one crash that we had
in our we had a few other crashes in our
various playthroughs but now that
particular one unfortunately
[Applause]
all right back a business
[Music]
[Music]
just lighting position
[Music]
Hey what
let me out are you laughing
closed or was i nervous
yeah absolutely but at the same time
when I what I enjoy most about their
shows when when people come together and
we can do these events I take the time
and I watched the audience's reaction
when the show's playing because that's
what I buy buffer right and to see
people get excited to see be you see
their facial reaction and to hear the
noise when something happens that you
know I know it was good to be there
right before it's awesome so hey I did
have the time to you know relax a little
bit with with with everyone and it was a
good time
it was scary honestly but fun face where
guys are really awesome and they showed
me like some tips and tricks to make it
look really good and yeah I just sat
there and in the mirror like just
practicing all this I'm trying to get it
to look right we wanted to show where
3-0 is up to but we and we knew we
wanted to show face where and the face
tracking because we've gotten it to the
point where we felt like we wanted to
show up publicly so we thought it'd be
really great to sort of play in 3-0 but
add on the element that the face where
and face tracking and then so that was
that was kind everything well you know
what else well how can we end the demo
on something big and we've been working
on the interest for squadron 42 and it
was making some great progress and
actually Nathan Daisley
who's a ship art director as long being
pitching says why don't you just have an
interest loan on a planet and then we
drive it over into it at the end of the
demo okay well okay so so then we then
we thought well that could be cool but
why don't we have two addresses fight
each other
[Music]
as you can see events like games come
our a tremendous amount of effort and
coordination we'd like to thank all the
sources and devs streamers and
volunteers that helped make it happen
because we couldn't have done it without
you
well that's all for today's show but
before we go we just wanted to remind
everyone there will be no monthly report
for August
now that Gamescom is over things will go
back to normal and you can expect
September's monthly report in a few
weeks thanks to our subscribers as
always we pitch in a little extra each
month to help make these shows September
ship of the month will be the Drake
Herald
so starting Friday all you need to do is
log into the game to try it out and
thanks to all our backers for your
support events like games come really
highlight the importance of our
community and we can't thank you enough
for everything you've done to make this
game a reality and until next week we
will see you
[Music]
thank you for watching so if you want to
keep it with the latest and greatest in
