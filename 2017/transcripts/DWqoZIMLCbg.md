yeah everyone we are here in my fancy
dance test level and we have a
compilation that can't fly and
unfortunately this is a bug that I
introduced well how this happened and
why what do you got now I know I have a
feature a little bit ago that allows you
to get out of the seat and the engines
will remain on your thrusters will still
be there so if you set the cruise mode
you could get out of your ship walk
around your ship will still be flying
forward before in the past we couldn't
do that because the way that the legacy
items worked the on and the use were
connected so you the players set down a
seat you used it
therefore it was on that was key linked
connection on item 2.0 we have separated
this soyuz and turning on and off
completely different and i'm going to do
is introduce this to the thrusters
change a little bit code in the vehicle
code and now when you turn on the
engines they'll stay on so if you get
out of my ship will make some coffee
my ship will keep going straight but
unfortunately this broke the cut a lot
pretty much 90% of the ships you know
it's one of those things where i tested
three shifts and of those three shifts
only they work everything else was
broken I test the m50 tested the the
Gladius and a testing the Cutlass and
they were so the code went in and then
oh my god everything blocker everything
on fire because ships couldn't fly why
did that happen
I'll show you
so here we have this thing called a
flight controller in our fun little
hierarchy you have the ship which has
this control manager it has a bunch of
controllers that dictate control over
items and when you take control of this
specific controller which flight
controller you have control of the
thrust we have control of the engines
you could fly the ship and I had to
change a bit of code in here to allow
you to to flying and get auto ship but
unfortunately I forgot one bit of code
when you sit down you get this call for
start use and then when you leave you
get this call to get removed and what I
forgot to do was when the player sits
down the fee interface we here's our
player where we have these two things
called enable/disable action handlers so
I'm all suppose to re add this code to
enable action handler flight controller
action Handler and what is this this is
the thing that turns on specific actions
so if I hit buttons the spaceship can
hear and listen to since I didn't turn
it on you never got the controls to well
move the ship and if I scroll back to
where I was I should rien a ballista
of course recode never likes my name
there we go I got enabled hash to do and
then when we're done we've got to make
sure we disable the control shouldn't be
able to have the spaceship listening to
your fun little controls when you're
walking around so we'll get Rico give it
a try and see what happens
all right recode is finished now we have
to get out of the ship and back into the
ship and crush everything we crashed
because this is the beauty like this is
actually a logical crash what happened
was I added to come on gotta wait for
visual studio to figure itself out all
right so I added this bit of code here
to disable the action handler but it
wasn't enabled in the beginning because
I added the code and recompile the game
and because I disabled it the game
crashed because it was like wait a
minute you're trying to turn this off
but I was never on to begin with oh and
it dies so we're going to recut or coded
again go back in the game and see what
accident I think the thing that best
summarizes this is this awesome picture
found on the internet when one thing
breaks everything breaks wall from us
all right we're back in the game
okay back in the game we're going to now
ah Cutlass make sure we're able to fly
around yeah it fly there's good and will
spawn ourselves consolation and haha
we're flying there we go
everything's good everything sound we're
able to fly again and we could get on
the seat and let the ship continue to
fly as it pleases hope you guys enjoyed
so like time should I am oh the fun
times when you add a new feature you're
like oh I want to be able to get out of
the ship and the thrusters are so long
so you check it in because you tried it
on the three ships then all what happens
it breaks because you didn't check every
other ship and it was just one of those
silly things where I forgot to add one
line and then everything works ah one of
those days hope you guys enjoyed until
next time thank you for watching so if
you want to keep up with the latest and
greatest in star citizen and squadron 42
