hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizens ongoing development I'm Sandy
Gardner and I'm will weom on today's
show we'll take a look at the new kiosk
system coming in 3.0 we'll show you how
this seemingly small mechanic is an
important first step in building the
game's Dynamic economy but before that
let's check in with Brian Chambers for
an update from our office in Frankfurt
hello I'm Brian Chambers development
director of our Foundry 42 Frankfurt
office team's been busy this last month
as usual pushing on numerous fronts for
3.0 which is part of the large
persistent universe as well as Squadron
42 the past month we had numerous
visitors to the office including both
Chris and a in we find that traveling to
the other offices from time to time to
either work side by side with people or
to discuss the current status of things
and future plans is absolutely
invaluable so let's start off this
month's update with the VFX
team the Frankfurt VFX team has been
working on improving existing systems
for the 3.0 release this includes
checking all the existing vehicles and
systems to make sure things are still
working as initially intended and doing
a Polish pass on any effects if needed
with some of the new systems coming
online such as the oxygen system for
rooms they remade some of the old
airlock effects for both the high-tech
and lowtech airlocks this month they
also started shifting more Focus towards
Squadron 42 cinematic scenes that are
required for the single player campaign
the FPS weapons team completed passes on
the last two Legacy weapons that we
using our old system completing a first
pass on the G I l86 ballistic pistol and
completing a final pass on the bearing
P4 AR ballistic rifle they continue to
make progress on the ship weapons for
the Clausen verer laser repeaters they
finished off all the work for sizes 1
through three started work on sizes 4-
six and finished off the apocalypse arms
ballistic scatter gun size
1-3 uh they also worked on some general
tasks focused towards 3.0 including
polishing optimizing and Bug
fixing the tech art team finished
multiple animation implementation tasks
for both the recent usable Sprint as
well as cinematics they continued to
debug weapon animation issues and did
some adjustments to a few of the weapons
rigs to make them even more realistic
and believable they also did some work
on a VFX exporter this was primarily
made to export simulated objects from
within Maya having an active simulation
on objects was causing some problems
with the animation export and the best
way to work around this is to bake the
simulation and Export the animation but
that's timec consuming and leaves the
scene in a state where the VFX artist
can't do any changes to the simulation
so the exporter takes care of that whole
process it bakes the simulation exports
all the necessary stuff for the engine
and restores the scene so the artists
Contin continue to iterate on whatever
they need the tool also creates all the
necessary in engine files so the artist
can hit the export button and see the
results immediately in the engine they
also continue to support the animation
code with ground alignment R&D progress
is going good and we'll be able to show
off some of the results very very
soon for game programming last month
they spent time fixing outstanding
issues and polishing up existing code
the new airlocks and elevators are now
being used more throughout the game
which exposed a few issues where game
and engine code conflicted with one
another so those items were identified
and work has begun to sort them out they
also added a small feature to weapons to
be able to hide the weapon from The
firstperson View during aim down sight
which falls in line with the design and
will make things much easier while In
the Heat of combat the technology to
easily apply weapon skins was also
completed it utilizes the work
previously done for character
customizations
there's still some UI work to be done on
it and the Skins themselves are
placeholder for testing but the work
will now allow simple and fast setups of
weapon skins in data Forge they'll now
continue more work on the weapon system
2.0 and additional elevator and airlock
feature polish geared towards
3.0 the AI team has been working on more
Mission broker and mission system
features mostly for pu 3.0 but also
offering support for s42 the mission
broker has been adapted to support
multiple players accepting the same
Mission and they had the ability for
Mission instances to share information
which means players accepting the same
collection mission for example will be
sent after the same item rather than
having their own distinct item to
collect they'll now build on that work
by adding support for abandoning
missions as well as unlawful and lawful
asymmetric missions for multiple players
this month day added support for takeoff
and landing of AI ships and surfaces
this includes Landing Pad ship hangers
other ships and Celestial surfaces we're
also adding Quantum travel functionality
for the new non kythera AI this is part
of an ongoing effort to create all ship
AI functionalities we need for
subsumption based AI for the remainder
of the month they'll be focusing on
adding more subsumption AI support like
using nav splines and correct AI
Behavior when entering exiting all
vehicles and seats they also finished up
the second Sprint for Buddy AI designers
can now specify if they want to keep the
AI in front or on the side of the leader
or player this Sprint also brings the
ability for an AI buddy to take cover in
front of the player and moving from
cover to cover Point while following the
player this is the first step in having
a companion AI that will intelligently
follow you and help you out in combat
the Frankfurt engine team in cooperation
with UK refine the handling of GPU
crashes and proper reporting via the
public crash Handler as we render frames
we now include tokens into the command
stream in order to pinpoint more easily
what the GPU was last doing in case it
starts hanging this info was set along
with other crash information for
postmortem analysis via our public crash
Handler service and these steps should
make it easier for us to more quickly
react on GP issues found in the PTU that
are otherwise hard to produce because
the specific machine setup OS driver
versions Etc they also did a large
number of performance analysis and
engine optimizations geared towards 3.0
release another item they started to
work on was a new road system to work in
conjunction with the planetary terrain
the Legacy roads were not suitable for
our large scale terrain there was a
large performance hit and they also had
Z fighting and flickering issues when
viewed from long distances
the new system is extremely fast and
efficient cache friendly and fully
multi-threaded to send draw commands to
the GPU in the most efficient way the
new system uses a screen space approach
instead of drawing the geometry
conventionally it's powered by a
projective technique like what we use on
deferred decals it has two distinct
rendering passes first we draw the road
geometry as a 3D Volume which intersects
the terrain in this pass a stencil mask
is generated to outline border of the
road the same mask is then used in the
next render pass to clip all pixels of
the volumes that are not affecting the
terrain finally to generate UVS and
fetch material textures each pistol's
position is reconstructed in camera
space and then in local space by
sampling the depth all material
attributes are then finally written in
the G buffer to compute lighting thanks
to the nature of the projection this
technique doesn't suffer any Z fighting
or flickering related issues they also
created a new tool set to give designers
the ability and flexibility to quickly
lay down the New Roads and modify them
as needed it's still currently a work in
progress and the terrain and textures in
the video are currently placeholder for
testing but the progress is going well
and it will be a nice addition to our
growing tool set for planets the level
design team is currently making a pass
on the room system for Levi ensuring
that the player won't unnecessarily
suffocate in random places as well as
general polish and bug fix for 3.0 they
also begun taking a look at the lville
which is the next Flagship Landing Zone
on our list to tackle the Frankfurt QA
team wrapped up June with multiple test
requests from the engine team including
a change to the entity component update
scheduler which affects how parts of
entities are updated as well as the
particle code which was changed to run
on threads all code changes have the
potential to introduce new issues to an
already functional build so thorough
comparison testing was performed to sure
that nothing new would be introduced
into Game Dev they also had test
requests for area optimizations and
recent code changes affected how things
such as doors and elevators work and
these changes would give us roughly 1.5
millisecond frame time back which is
obviously an improvement subsumption
testing continues this month with new
features and Bug fixes going into
subsumption tool weekly they continue to
work closely with the design team and
Tony Z to ensure that the tool is
Thoroughly tested to their satisfaction
performance testing is also underway for
persistent Universe they use the
performance profiler tool from Visual
Studio to gather very specific data in
areas of low performance they gather as
much information is possible within the
internal QA team and continue to do
weekly cross Studio play tests in order
to increase the stress of the servers
and to simulate an actual live
environment as much as possible Melissa
Estrada our QA technical lead has also
had fun time this month testing various
gravity conditions on the new
moons the system design team has been
working on items for 3.0 and with a lot
of focus on the lesy landing Zone we
have Rob Riner from the Austin office
visit and managed to get a lot of work
done in a short amount of time they're
experimenting with leski having a full
AI population the AI behaviors needed
some work to ensure that they're not
causing them to overcrowd in any given
area they also spent time stress testing
our servers to determine what AI
populations we can support and still get
the performance that we need during the
process they work closely with the tech
team to optimize so we can keep the
performance as solid as possible the
cinematics team has been continuing to
work on scenes across all chapters of
Squadron 42 this month they also spent
time working with the graphic Engineers
to continue work on the two-dimensional
render to texture display screens and
holographic volume rendering work this
month our lead lighting artist Chris
Campbell was solely focused on applying
some of the final touches in our 3.0
content including color grading for each
Moon as you can see here integrating
lighting between The Outpost in the
moons and doing bug fixing and polishing
on the leski landing Zone the
environment team has been hard at work
on polishing and Bug fixing existing
content in the Pu with all the various
components coming together we want to
make sure the visual experience for the
player is as absolutely good as it can
possibly be on leski new areas and
locations have been added that will
increase the number of things the
players can do and explore including a
new store and an admin office the newly
added garages received a final polish
and dressing pass making them ready to
be used they also put a lot of effort
this month into researching and
development looking at new features
going into the game after
3.0 this includes work on Art Corp
procedural cities as well as the planet
Hurston an important element of the
research phase is that we find smart and
scalable solutions that allow us to
create more content as efficiently as
possible moving forward well that's it
for this month's update as always thank
you so much for watching and all the
support thanks for the subscribers that
enable us to provide these monthly
updates to the community take care and
we'll see you in the
verse lots of great stuff from our team
in Frankfurt those in-game Holograms are
looking pretty cool yeah it's really
impressive Tech that we'll be using a
lot going forward we captured a ton of
ship-to ship comps for squadron
42 and I know that because I spent a few
hours sitting in a fake cockpit getting
all of Pusher com calls yeah I think all
together we spent weeks capturing com
messages so expect to see this Tech used
a lot going forward another new system
that you'll be seeing soon is kiosks
arriving in 3.0 these devices will
expand the shopping options and services
currently in game right kiosks are an
integral part of this game's economy and
need to tie into other important backend
systems like subsumption so getting them
up and running has required a lot of
effort from numerous
departments now let's take a look under
the hood and show you exactly what it
takes to upgrade your shopping
experience hi I'm Rob rininger I'm the
lead technical designer in Austin I'm
Spencer Johnson I'm an associate
gameplay engineer on the LA team I'm Zan
bienen I am the UI creative director
here at f42 I'm Trevor warish the
principal UI artist here I'm Pete Macky
senior designer on Star Citizen the
kiosk is our first for a into an economy
in the game a real living economy driven
by the players the kiosk is going to be
the users interface to purchase things
or sell them within the game that are
not physically within the shop in the
case of purchasing or um things in their
inventory things from from their ship
all selling will be done through the
kiosk what that will allow you to do is
view an entire store's uh inventory you
can browse to the list you can filter it
you can sort it and view its uh stats
and comparison to other things it it
will extend to eventually The Landing
Services you can use the kiosk to
restock your ship and refill and so
forth you'll be able to equip a ship
item directly on the ship at the time of
purchase if you want or have it
delivered to the cargo hold of your ship
it's almost like uh you know ordering
through Amazon or something where you
can select a shipping destination so
whether you have a ship landed out a
cargo pad or there's a cargo area in the
landing Zone you're at or you want to
ship it somewhere like you can select
that as an option so I've been working
on economy related stuff almost since
January of
2013 and so I'm really excited that you
know we're getting to the point now that
you know the stuff that we were talking
about you know in the early days of the
project we have tool support internally
for that I can actually start building
this stuff in addition I work out things
like the recipes for the supply chains
and Manufacturing recipe in the context
of Star Citizen is somewhat similar to a
crafting recipe in um other MMOs uh it
defines the types of Commodities and
resources that go into
manufacturing um a given item like a
laser cannon or uh even a ship the way
that we use recipes and the way that you
might find them in another game is that
those recipes generally aren't used
directly by the players instead they're
used by the design team to really sculpt
the the the types of goods that are
bought and sold at any location in the
world and that's to make that location
feel correct so if it's a factory that
it buys and sells the kinds of things
that you would expect from that location
I've been working on the backend code
side of the shopping and kiosk systems
the simplest way to describe making the
the shopping component we have is
talking with the various systems that
are all involved in the player making
purchases and transactions through the
the whole whole process of using a kiosk
or using a storefront to buy things and
then have that enter into your
persistence so Commodities make up a a
big part of the economy because
everything within the game is Created
from one of the resources that runs
through the system iron Gold Titanium uh
hydrogen oxygen to get Commodities into
the game means that we can start
building the foundation for creating uh
an actual economy where if deliveries
aren't being made to a location then and
all of a sudden their manufacturing
capability is no longer you know at its
Peak Performance so their demand goes up
you know prices go up you can start to
get that fluctuation in pricing so in
terms of the beginning Point like this
is really a big step for for getting
that in place some of the big challenges
for developing this economy is unifying
the scale because you know as you know
we have items you know from super tiny
and inconsequentially priced all the way
up to like you know these massive battle
Cruisers right and they all have to fit
somewhere on the same the same scale and
so that's been probably one of the the
biggest challenges and the others are
just the the scope of the the amount of
work that has to get done in in terms of
building the recipes and you know even
at to the point of building the
individual shop inventories um because
that's all done by hand we've we have a
location and we want it to buy and sell
certain things so we actually as
designers have to go in and you know
determine what what is bought and sold
there when you go and buy these
Commodities you're going to buy a bunch
of iron say I mean where's that iron
going to go your ship right that makes
the most sense got to go in your ship
but what if you have multiple ships so
obviously there needs to be a way to say
oh I want to put this in my my Hornet or
you know I want to put this in my Eder I
want to put the stuff I'm buying right
now in this ship and you've got you know
cargo grids you've got this whole other
system that's being developed of how
much stuff can we put in the ship and
how is the player going to decide what
ship to put it in so a lot of these
options lead to needing very Dynamic
Solutions on the code side we need to
accommodate putting these Commodities
anywhere we need to give the player the
option to select where they're going we
need to save where the stuff is kept
because certainly you might think oh you
know it's just in the ship but it
becomes very complicated on the
persistence end of things when saving
what the player has done well where did
they keep it you know all of this iron
you need need to keep track of O is left
in this cargo bay of this ship which was
on this port of you know this space
station you know a lot of these
different systems are first of all not
always running directly on your computer
at home sometimes running in our Sig
back uh backend systems and there's also
a lot of asynchronous events and calls
so you you have to wait for things to
happen basically you have to send
messages and wait for answers rather
than just getting immediate feedback
because again like I said the shopping
component really exists at the center of
a lot of different things communicating
I also set the prices for the
Commodities and it's a similar process
um it doesn't have quite as
much uh it's not quite as intricate as
the pricing for the the items because
there aren't uh you know gameplay values
associated with this that I need to take
into account so um we actually have a
tool uh that we internally called trade
Slayer and another one called price
fixer that uh help with this job and
trade layers primarily for fixing the
setting the prices for the Commodities
um what it does is it helps me figure
out what the base value for a commodity
should be uh based off of a bunch of
different uh analytics data points and
then it also helps me figure out like
what the uh ranges that those should
fluctuate in um and then price fixer
does a very similar task but it's quite
a bit more complicated and that helps me
set the prices for the items but then it
actually takes that step one step
further and then I use those items to
help me value a ship so it goes all the
way from uh pricing a countermeasure
launcher uh to the the price of a
constellation with the included p-52
some of the challenges that we faced uh
when designing this was you know CR
really wants that tangible feel he wants
to be able to see the items he wants to
be able to see how it's going to look on
on you know a ship or you know in in the
place that it belongs so doing that in a
way where people don't have to navigate
you know 5,000 different layers of a of
a hierarchy in a window having that be
understandable and intuitive uh to the
player is was the big challenge here
complexity for the economy is pretty
deep um because it it is tightly
integrated with the game play a large
portion of my time is spent interfacing
with a tech design team just to make
sure that I understand how the item uh
progression curves work and what the
expected types of uh play are for those
items so that I can make sure that you
know they have the right price one of
the most exciting things about building
the kiosk was the visual style side of
it there's going to be a low-end kind of
like an old school DOS prompt BBS Forum
style and then we also have a mid-end
like a mid 2000s Web 2.0 style if you go
to Grim hex is where you'll see the
low-end kiosks for all for example have
kind of the mid nice range kiosk one
thing we had to take into account was
branding of this interface so when you
go into a shop sake Saba Outlet you'll
see the logo and the color scheme
applied it's all one underlying system
but we swap out the graphics depending
on the store and the manufacturer it was
really fun to design the old school
style one the low-end one just kind of
developed these frame by frame
animations that you would see old you
know Doss games and things like that
when I talk about the shopping code mod
and it existing sort of as this
glorified middleman this intermediary
step between a lot of moving Parts one
of those parts is subsumption like
backend shopping service there's a whole
bunch of backend Services we have as a
part of subsumption in the diffusion
system uh one of those is the shopping
service what the code that I'm writing
does it communicates to this backend
service which exists on our Sig servers
and gets inventory information alisar
dumpers Depot or cassaba has this
inventory with these prices this
quantity of that item and every store
has a unique set of information and so
we need to communicate to that backend
service and periodically update restock
things like that and it's there's just a
large communication chain of different
moving parts that need to be talked to
at different times there's definitely a
lot of communication that happens
between these different teams like the
UI kiosk team and myself the shopping
backend team because we're in different
countries it's a it's a lot of back and
forth it's okay so we need to interface
like this uh we need to have this line
of communication often times we'll
create function interfaces so we could
say this is exactly the code you need to
call even if I haven't written it yet
this is what it'll look like the kiosk
actually requires a lot of different
changes to go in for 3o uh we needed you
know persistence uh for ships persistent
DB as far as their inventory so as
people purchase Goods there they have to
fly a ship to a location purchase the
the stuff uh that they want on that ship
fly that ship to another location in
order to sell it so it doesn't allow
people to go to any location they want
and spawn any ship it forces them to fly
their ships around the universe so
previously you were able to just do you
know oh I'm MC Grim hex and I want my
freelancer now or I want my Hornet now
so now that people have to fly these
things around it's going to force them
to think about like oo maybe I need an
escort back to this other place cuz I
want to leave this ship here but I want
to you know get a different ship and
bring it over here so I can buy or sell
some things for this ship prices will
change based on inventory levels and
stock levels and those inventory and
stock levels
are set on a per location basis so you
can have two different casabas in two
different uh parts of the world um that
have different pricing schemes and it
may be that they have the same base
price for a given item but due to the
fact that one of them might be farther
away from a distribution point that it
gets restocked less often and therefore
the price stays higher on that item uh
more regularly uh than at the other shop
and that's just one example of kind of
the the complexity that uh we should be
able to deliver in 3.0 your player
persistence is everything that you own
as a player so it could be the
Commodities you have you know how many
uh SEO of iron do you have or you know
what shirt are you wearing so that would
be your player's persistence data
luckily uh that system already exists
it's constantly making improvements to
it and so this new shopping code we have
has to interface with some the older
parts of of persistence and some of the
newer Parts as well so that we really
make sure we're we're saving what you do
the big thing that is going to change
for 3 is that it's really going to start
to feel a lot more like the overall
experience that that we've been talking
about for so long persistence is a big
part of that the ability to interface
with um things in the game through the
kiosk is going to be another big portion
of that uh cargo system is coming online
actually being able to carry things and
have your ship keep track of the stuff
that's on it and require people to to
transfer goods from A to B that was a
big part of our hauling and trading uh
professions that's the exciting part
what we're doing right now is it's
laying the foundation for these cool
features we're going to see coming up
like systemic pricing like Dynamic
economies that really react to players
buying things in certain locations and
selling them in others as these things
start to come online it's really going
to change the experience that people are
having now and turn it much more into
the game that we envision so the cool
thing about the kiosk is it's in world
like all of our other interfaces so you
know that will have tie-ins with the
interaction system where you can you
know bring up a cursor and interact with
the screen so that will be sort of our
first foray into getting interactable
screens in
world uh working with this unified
interaction system so later on we'll
expand that to elevator panels and other
uh inor screens the kios is is is a nice
test because it's it has quite in-depth
functionality like sorting and filtering
uh in you know pop-ups and things like
that so it's quite a complex interface
over let's say something simple like an
elevator floor selection panel so it's a
good test for us this is the big step
we've been waiting for for a long time
to be able to start adding a lot of
these other professions and and features
into the game so I'm I'm really excited
about it it's going to be the beginning
of a lot of great things for the players
it's going to be
awesome I love the Retro look of those
lowend kiosks they're really fun and
have a lot of character yeah you'll be
able to tell a lot of about where you
are in the verse just by seeing what
kind of kiosks are around that kind of
environmental storytelling is important
considering how many Landing zones the
game will have and that's all for
today's episode thanks to our
subscribers for your continued support
July's edition of jumpo will be released
tomorrow so be sure to check it out
definitely it's going to be a good one
and finally our big thanks to all our
backers for helping us build this game
the level of community engagement at
this point in the development process is
just one of the many things that make St
citizen so special true that until next
week we will see you around the verse
