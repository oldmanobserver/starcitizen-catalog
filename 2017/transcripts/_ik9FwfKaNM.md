hey everyone if they are Karen Davis
Gamescom started this week in Cologne
Germany and we're very excited by all
the feedback coming in from the
attendees as we're showcasing some of
the planetary experiences you'll be
playing in the 3.0 release now as we
promised last week instead of a full
round the verse we're doing a standalone
episode of burn down our weekly show
dedicated to reviewing progress on
issues blocking the release of star
citizen alpha 3.0 now last week we ended
at seventy-seven total must fix issues
broken down by 12 blockers 37 criticals
23 hives 5 moderates and zero trivial x'
so let's check in with the team on how
it's going and outpost for interview so
here is the garage area I did for
matsing laps key exterior so major
challenge I got is like this is a
massive landing zone so we really have
to take care to design the lighting very
carefully to make sure we get the player
to the right place and take this large
gorgeous example and I live scene system
it's a very simple room but we also have
to consider like once how the lighting
another life once the huge cow should
see this will forget dropping so here we
have to look after both the illuminance
in this is carefully so as a character
so I do have some other examples a ski
area working on the lighting I use the
amico samples quite finely spaced and we
have to make sure the lighting works
well on the environment and inheritance
so normally when working on because
actually we have lots of problems about
darken areas like was a character move
to the corners we can have a problem so
that's why we introduce those character
and make sure the Mikey Works post on
environment and character discs so right
now we're working on state machines or
animation flow graphs that allow us to
be able to break down the performance
capture that was shot and be able to
focus on which idols the actors
naturally moved into and be able to
select those and be able to quickly then
put those idols onto the performances
edit them together and also how those
different performances connect what sort
of low micro transitions and things like
that that they need and this is an
example of one of those animation flow
graphs which shows how the character
gets from stand idle into the different
things that he does these are our
hawkers people selling things at a stall
that that you'll see so actions like
calling over greeting when you're
looking at something when you're
browsing something and things like that
that we're getting we're doing this so
that we can get as much of that actors
performance into those characters once
we we have this this is separate than a
behavioral state machine so a behavioral
state machine will say when you come in
to his range he's going to beckon you
over when you're up at his counter he's
going to greet you but he's not going to
say goodbye to you until he's greeted
you so the behavioral state machine is
this governing logic that controls what
the the Hawker does and the animation
flow graph tells the animators how best
to go about creating edits for in
creating new assets for it so that we
can we can get those performances in the
game
I wonder if it's a issue we're on the
ship side of things we're implementing
all the iya mobile glasses inside the
cockpits which require unique bogie
glass animations to be framed properly
so you can use it in all the cool
features that are involved with that so
there's there over there's the movi
guidance of course there's an error but
yeah framing that so you can press all
these buttons have to be provided
doesn't the interiors broken so when I
load it in everything falls to the
bottom well as the ship's falling the
landing gear is still like steady like
out and it's fine and it's just
following the biggest issues I've been
hitting for the landing gear and the
damage are well the landing gear want to
retract over the land and deploy it in
space which is the opposite behavior
makes it really hard to test this new
springy landing gear compression that
we're doing so here's here's what I'm
seeing right now so it'll retract and
[Music]
but actually that one worked
what the hell that one worked but I
[Music]
there we go that's my bug oh and they
broke off so that's not good I think it
was happening is like we changed a lot
about it persistently removes it all but
on creating a load out from the path
that it's using before the debug 10 it's
not correctly threading through the
persistence flag to actually enable
adding the new items so you spawn you
have nothing including your heading so I
think that if I change that it should
persist correct like the spot you have
to begin
absalom so one thing that we just
knocked off our plates is we've been
working with the design team on
randomized NPC names so that when you
have a mission rather than being called
NPC one or security guard or something
generic like that we're creating a
system in which to create character
names and assign amount so we just
uploaded our first batch for testing in
the next mission sprint and I think
currently there's some seven million two
hundred thousand current combinations of
names available and that was only about
half our list so we shouldn't be able to
have a robust community of NPC names
which is needed when you have solar
systems after solar system that need
NPCs walking around so that was pretty
exciting so we're trying to figure out
the odds of getting any one person's
name we've been hiding like dev first
and last names in there so hopefully
you'll be able to see some of the
designers walking around the biggest
challenge we're having right now 43.0 is
we're wanting to put lights and all the
helmets and so we are struggling to get
engine earrings time to fix some bugs
that are going on with the the lights
being all the put in the helmet because
it's a it's not as simple as you think
of just dragging and dropping a light in
it's complicated because it goes into a
different entry than it would and just
like a normal asset like it's not just
an art asset because it's also pulling
in something pulling in a light asset
from dataforge which is a separate
thing entirely so it's not like just
putting a light in the level it's having
to pull it from somewhere else
and it right now the lights are not a
lot aligning to the correct place so
even if we put the light in and where we
want it to be and tell it where it's
supposed to go it's not attaching to the
helper so that's a big problem for us
right now the other big focus for the
character team right now is just
polishing up all the assets so we're
polishing up pretty much anything that's
going into the game now just kind of
giving it a good second look to make
sure that it looks like it's good to go
I'm making sure there's no bugs with it
making sure all the textures are coming
make Owen King making sure everything's
included which is an inclusion exclusion
process which is basically making sure
that we're wanting all the files to go
into the build that we want to go into
the build so if you forget one something
we'll just not show up bro show up with
a replacement texture or you know that
happens occasionally especially when
we're making all these color variants
for all these different assets if we
forget to include one of the materials
ulsan it just disappears so it's just a
little bit of extra work there oh yeah
currently for three oh we got we
actually of a lot of item text that we
have to do basically needs to be sort of
localized and connected and stuff like
that because we have all the stores are
coming online in the shopping and stuff
like that
and so basically we have a lot of ship
components clothes armor weapons
you know weapon magazines all that stuff
and all that needs not only just a name
description but we've actually started
to handle the hook up with data Forge
ourselves so we're actually connecting
it in the engine and stuff like that so
we're sort of doing checks to make sure
that the stuff is coming through and if
strings are broken and stuff like that
so that's taking a lot of time and also
with the emissions coming online we have
a lot of procedural mission texts that
we need to do and so we'll had worked up
a spreadsheet formula that allows us to
basically randomize within the
spreadsheet so we can kind of test out
but basically need so it's basically a
bad libs thing
we write a sentence with like you know
you're being hired to pick up blank
which could be a box a crate or whatever
and take it to destination and center
and so basically we not only write the
mad lives but we have to write the
variations and so the spreadsheet that
he made will basically Auto randomize it
so we can we can kind of spot check
everything to make sure it's it's
plugging in all right what I'm working
right now on for the 3-0 release is this
new feature that we call illudium gain
for momentum behavior so this is a
simple test map that I use for my
development of the led update for a
moment and behavior what I'm going to
show you right now is first like the how
the behavior will change when you are
close and when you are far so in this
case if I jump in game this behavior
will test the communication of some
specific facial and outer lines in this
case the audio is one loud out of line
that we would use in a shopkeeper
behavior and the behavior just went five
seconds and then triggers the line if I
go far we will see that the first of all
the character were Tebow's because all
his animation will be posed and its
movement will be poses physics a
signature will be most and in the
behavior the video will update its
on-screen the weight will update and the
communication will immediately succeed
because it's not really important if
there be a is not close what I want to
show you is basically this force update
is dependent on the action areas that
are this green area around the character
so when a character is inside an area
that is visible for the player then it
will anyway at least simulate aligned
with this behavior
if the Aria is also can basically not
visible right now we use a 100 pixel on
screen size to decide if something is
arranged or not for the blade so you see
I'm going very far they are a still
green and eventually it will turn red
and the back draw information on screen
without some date for its behavior of
the are in and the other issue is when
we blow up the big ships the debris is
not rotating so it looks like LEGO
pieces kind of just moving earth like
this so where we've got fixes in the
works and I should be getting new code
very shortly and we will be fixing this
stuff up you know it's gonna be a late
night now as you can see things change
almost every other minute since we're
never not working or testing star
citizen right now we've resolved 22 and
only added 3 to our must fix list this
means we're at 68 issues left we've
checked in over two thousand four new
changes and the remaining overall bug
and task count for 3.0 is 3519 it's been
quite the week across the entire company
and as we resolve more issues we get
increasingly energized coming down the
homestretch to the first release two non
CI G testers so check back next week
here on burned down
