Mark Abent (MA): Hey everyone, welcome to
Bugsmashers.
I’m your host Mark Abent, I’m a Gameplay
Programmer at CIG Los Angeles and I'm here
to show you behind the scenes of bugs and
how I smash them.
Let’s take a look.
Hey everyone.
We’re here inside of the Caterpillar and
we have a bug where these fun cargo doors
sometimes don’t open or they open incorrectly,
and these doors are a little special because
there’s an interior and exterior part.
So you can think of the interior here and
the exterior here, and when you open it, they’re
supposed to be coincide.
When you close it, they’re supposed to go
to together, however when you look away from
the door the exterior opens, but the interior
remains where it was until you look at it
and then it may start animating or just get
stuck.
So if we open it up, we can see it, everything
looks fun.
If I close it and look away, it’ll take
a bit…
BAM!
Oh we can see the exterior door close, but
the interior which it should show this metal
stuff with Drake on it and all that panels
is not closed.
So the interior, we can actually fly out.
The exterior closed, the interior has not.
So if I run over here and hit close, you can
see it snapped to the close position and now
it works correctly.
So what’s going on?
Well there’s a bit of code that says, “Hey
if this thing is visible, we can fire off
on the animations”.
The idea is it’s some kind of optimisation
so if there’s a ship wayyy out there, I
don’t have to animate it because why take
up all those CPU cycles, but unfortunately
when we’re inside the ship, the exterior
knows that we’re potentially visible so
it animates, but the interior when we switch
this way, that CGA in the back is not owned
by any entity it’s just there, and because
of that it doesn’t animate correctly.
Even though it's attached to the animation
of the ship, it’s just called out because
it’s like, “well it’s not visible so
I shouldn’t have to worry about it”.
So I have this bit of code in Manikin, if
I enable it, what this will do is it checks
to see if this entity has a parent which is
going to be the ship and if this door, the
interior is enslaved to the exterior and the
exterior is visible, then we allow it to animate
even though you can’t see it.
The idea is if you can see the exterior, then
you should potentially see the interior when
the door opens and closes.
So what we do is if the owner entity which
is going to be the vehicle which is going
to be the exterior door is active, but the
interior door is not, we’re going to force
it to be active.
Same thing down here, so we’re forcing the
entity active and we’re forcing the skeleton
to be active.
What that will do is this will allow the entity
to do an update call to tell the animation
system, “Hey I’m active, so go process
my animations”, and this will allow the
skeleton to actually function.
So two updates we have to do.
Entity system wanted to say, “hey, animation,
I’m ready”, and the animation system will
go, “yup, I’m ready too”.
So in theory this should allow if the outer
door is ready, the inner door will be forced
to be ready so they can open and close together.
So let's hit the recode button and take a
look at what happens.
Okay recode is done, let’s start back up
the game, alright!
So we’re back in the level and let's close
the door.
Magic door close.
We won’t look at it.
Wham!
It’s closed as you would expect.
Alright let's open it again.
Let’s not look at it, not look at it, and
it’s open!
So now we’re getting the interior update
when the exterior is updating.
So if I close this, going into another room,
open that door, go to the other room it’s
closed correctly and this room should be open
correctly.
So if the interior is not updating, but the
exterior is, we say, “Hey you should be
because we’re updating both” and then
they both play the animation, everything works
well and you could open and close your doors
just by not looking at it.
Well hope you guys enjoyed, till next time!
So as you guys saw we had the Caterpillar
and its just a gigantic long ship and it has
all these bay doors in it and you’re supposed
to be able to hit one or open one up and brings
down the bay door and it's a little bit of
complicated geometry in this setup because
we have an exterior mesh for the door and
an interior mesh.
So there’s two doors that open and close
and what was happening is when you’re looking
at one of the doors it opened correctly, however
if you looked that way when the doors open,
one of the doors would open, but the other
would stay intact and it would usually be
the exterior door that opened and the interior
door when you’re inside wouldn’t open
until you looked at it and then it would start
animating, but by then it would be too late,
it would be stuck open or stuck closed.
You could go around and hitting all the buttons
and it wouldn’t move until you looked at
it.
It was a simple fix, we just made sure that
if the exterior animates, then we force the
interior to animate at the same time.
So the doors would open close even if you
looked the opposite way.
Hope you guys enjoyed, until next time.
