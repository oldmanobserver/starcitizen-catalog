Sandi Gardiner (SG): Hey everyone and welcome
to Around the Verse.
I’m Sandi Gardiner and with me is Star Citizens’
Game Director, Chris Roberts.
Chris Roberts (CR): Hey Sandi.
So thrilled to be here of course.
I’m actually going to be heading off to
Europe this Sunday, so I’ll be there for
a few weeks so you’ll have other hosts here
with Sandi going forward for a few weeks until
I come back.
SG: Speaking of Europe.
CR: Speaking of Europe look what we got from
a fan in Switzerland.
He’s sent us lots of sugar obviously.
Swiss Toblerones, Swiss Caramels, Swiss knife.
SG: From Zurich, Switzerland, Martin Whip.
CR: Yeah and sent us a t-shirt from his organisation,
thank you very much.
SG: Check this out, bold.
CR: Pretty, I’m not that brave to actually
get a real Star Citizen tatoo on my arm.
SG: I’m not either, well done.
CR: Well done, very impressive and thank you
very much Martin.
Anyway back to the show.
Today’s show is going to be about something
very dear and near to my heart, the game's
AI.
SG: That’s right we’ve got Tony Zurovec
and Francesco to sit down and answer a few
questions about how players will be interacting
with NPCs in the game, but that will be coming
up later in the show.
CR: Yeah, first up we have our weekly studio
update from Nick Elms and our U.K. team.
Studio Update
Nick Elms (NE): Hi everyone, welcome to another
Studio Update from here in the U.K.
My name’s Nick Elms, I’m the Creative
Director here at Foundry 42.
As you might have imagined since the 2.6 release
we’ve been very busy trying to get 2.6.1
out for you.
There’s been a lot of bug fixing, a lot
of feedback that we’ve taken on board from
you guys and John Crewe and Andy Nicholson
have been looking at incorporating a balance
pass now with all the feedback we’ve been
gathering from you guys in the community from
you playing 2.6.
They’re making a comprehensive review that
hopefully we’re going to be getting into
2.6.1.
We’re going to look at the Misc Razor next
which I think you saw in November for the
concept sale.
It’s now with the ship team and in particular
Joe Navel who’s working on it through its
white box stage.
As part of the ongoing VFX polish and optimization,
we’re going to take a look at the Drake
Caterpillar.
We’ve been working on the throttle up and
down engine effects and with the Herald we’ve
been working on the explosion effects.
This is the kind of stuff that we send around
the office on a daily basis and we thought
we would share it would you guys so you can
get an idea of what we see.
As you’ll see the VFX guys have shared there’s
a Vroll of all the ship weapons firing simultaneously.
Surface outposts is what we’re going to
take a look at next which I think we’ve
released a couple of snapshots of, but it’s
starting to come online a lot further now
for us in the form of the building sets that
were starting to get through from the artists.
The designers are particularly excited about
all the gameplay opportunities that these
will afford as they can actually lay them
out on the planet surfaces now for you guys
to investigate.
That wraps up for another U.K. update.
As I mentioned earlier there’s a lot of
work still going on behind the scenes with
bug fixing and optimisations and feedback,
etc.
All that remains for me to say is back to
L.A. and see you in the verse.
Back to Studio
CR: Appreciate the update Nick.
Excited to see where the building sets are
headed, I mean that's fantastic, a lot of
great stuff in there.
SG: Definitely, no kidding, and the work the
effects team have been doing is really impressive.
Especially the Herald explosion, that was
very cool for me, and as we’re seeing all
the ship weapons lined up like that.
CR: Yup definitely seeing things shoot and
blow up is always very cool.
Nick also mentioned all the work going into
2.6.1.
If you want to learn more about the up and
coming patch make sure to head to the website
and look at our full production schedule to
get a full sense of what you can expect.
We’ll be updating the schedule every Friday
until the release so you can track our progress
via our website.
SG: And of course a lot of the changes and
rebalancing that we’re doing right now are
thanks to the fantastic testing that our backers
have been doing since 2.6 went live so thank
you to all the backers out there.
SG: Absolutely.
Your feedback is invaluable to the project
so I want to encourage all backers to keep
playing Star Marine, and Arena Commander,
and Crusader, and to keep letting us know
on the forums, Issue Council, as well as on
the Spectrum.
Please if you haven’t tried out Spectrum,
try Spectrum, It’s beta because we’ll
be going live with that soon.
It’ll help 2.6.1.
and 2.6.2.
and after that all the subsequent patches
to be as good as they can be.
SG: And as many of you know from our newsletter
we recently had many of the directors and
leads over at the L.A. office for several
weeks of discussions.
While that was going on we took advantage
of everyone being here to record some deeper
conversations about what we’re actively
working on.
CR: Yup absolutely, and as the game's AI system
is one of the most complicated and ground
breaking features that were currently in development
on Star Citizen, we figured it would be a
great opportunity to have lead AI programmer,
Francesco Roccucci and Persistent Universe
Director, Tony Zurovec gave an extended discussion
about the systems they’re building.
[5:50] AI
Tony Zurovec (TZ): I’m Tony Zurovec, I’m
the Director of the Persistent Universe for
Star Citizen.
Francesco Roccucci (FR): So I am Francesco
Roccucci and I am the Lead AI Programmer for
Star Citizen, so yeah, we work a lot together.
TZ: Yeah.
[What do you oversee at CIG?]
TZ: I’m predominantly focused on the architectural
side of the stuff - what the basic capabilities
are, how we expose that functionality to the
designers so that we can get as much leverage
from the development process as possible - this
includes working on the actual- developing
the editor itself which was the designer’s
interface.
FR: Well I think about all the architecture
from Tony and I make it real in the code,
basically.
We develop- I put the code- I architect the
code and we implement it and then I manage
other three people so far on the AI team - so
we have Andrega Boni, Mario Sarini, Rich Walsh
in the UK studio - so we are a bit in Germany
and a bit in UK.
AI in Star Citizen: An Update
TZ: The current state of AI in Star Citizen
is that we’re basically - I would say we’re
cresting the hill with regard to the initial
tier of architectural functionality.
Francesco has now got a lot of work to do
to basically take all of that, distribute
it to his guys, get it working within the
game and what we’re aiming to do within
the fairly near term is to be able to- for
the first, in significant fashion to be able
to start exposing this functionality to the
designers and they should have enough of the
base capability to start crafting actual missions
within the game.
It’s going to look, to some degree, like
the missions you’ve seen before except that
they should be able to create them much more
quickly which means we won’t be talking
about 17 missions - they’ll be able to create-
you’ll be talking about much larger potential
number of missions - you’ll be talking about
a lot larger of number of different things
you’ll be trying- problems that you’ll
be able to present to the player - you’ll
be talking about a lot more content that’s
going to have an algorithmic component to
it.
For example, right now, locations tend to
be fixed - and we’re going to be introducing
in the not-too-distant future the ability
to go down to planets and stuff and we don’t
want you to always encounter a derelict space
ship with a stranded pilot that needs to be
transported to here always in the exact same
location.
When you go to pick up that stranded pilot
- we don’t want him to always necessarily
be friendly; when you go to pick him up, we
don’t always want him to be alone - sometimes
it’s going to be an ambush, sometimes he’s
going to need medical attention.
These are things, all just in the course of
that one basic scenario - which is “distress
signal, crashed pilot, etcetera” - there
is a world of opportunity for us to create
a range of potential experiences for the player
and this is what- as soon as basically- Francesco’s
basically integrated the rest of this and
I’m sure there is-
FR: No pressure on me.
TZ: Little bits and pieces as we start to
mock-up the first tier of the subsumption
missions, but as soon as we’ve got that
then we’ll finally start to get a sense
as to what the designers can create with this.
FR: I think it’s always like this first
step, right?
Of getting the core-
TZ: Yep.
FR: -there in a state in which you’re not
only happy with the architect of the code
as well - because for me it’s a lot, I know
I can rely on the vision of Tony for that
for the architecture of the design and all
the other designers that we have - all very
talented people and the code as well has to
be architected in a way you can scale as much
as possible.
So like, you know the big work we’ve done
so far is to make sure that subsumption runs
and everything with acceptable amount of memory
usage and CPU usage.
We have all these concepts of activities that
are actually templates that can be re-used
between a lot of characters without creating
like instance everywhere or having the mission
system as well, reuse as much as possible
from the subsumption architecture and so even
after we create the same logic all over and
over again in different systems because it
uses different systems and it’s also accessing
content from one actor to the mission and
passing formation.
It just becomes very much quicker, you don’t
have to go through different DLLs - each DLL
can expose different functionality without
you- don’t have to add code to be doing
different- complete different structure and
then how do I expose this part to this other
system - it just becomes everything much more
fluid and much quicker to add stuff.
So yeah, that sometimes it takes a bit of
time but then I think we are starting to arrive
to the point where we are very happy of that.
We’re discussing the last bits that you
added - for example, this concept of adding
some reusable piece of logic that you can
recall and for us it’s very easy now to
implement that and every new functionality
seems it’s always quicker to add and you
can start of feel to say “We’re doing
a good job here” and I don’t like to say
it, myself, but I think it’s good when you
are happy of the work you are doing.
TZ: That’s something I referred to before,
which is- we’re very much focused and always
have been with regards to the direction we’re
going with the concept of this “object-oriented
content creation” which is to basically
distill all of the different pieces of functionality
that we’re going to use to build up these
larger missions to break them down into all
these component parts and then just like you
do in an object-oriented language like C++
to basically allow us to pass inputs in, to
extract outputs out so that we can customize
them dynamically in the scope of a much larger
problem.
And so what this is going to wind up allowing
us to do is after we’ve got that initial
library of functionality - designers are going
to be able to craft this stuff much, much
more quickly than they’ve been able to do
in the past and what this effectively means
to the player is a much larger amount of interesting
things to see and experience and challenges
to face and solve within the game world.
Subsumption
TZ: The first part of subsumption - the easiest
part of subsumption to basically expose is
actually going to be the mission side of it
- the mission side is basically built on top
of the, what you want to call the lower level
AI layer, there’s a lot of commonality in
terms of how we do message passing, the data
structures, the concept of functions, reasonable
parameters and all this kind of stuff, task
archetypes with which we build up the solutions
to these problems - the mission stuff in general
is a bit more straightforward to expose because
it doesn’t directly control any of the animation
stuff.
And the animation when you’re talking about
a modern 3D game - animation, even though
it’s not technically part of what most people
would call the AI, it’s plays a massive
role with regards to how people perceive it
- if you have a bartender and he’s going
about doing his business but the path find
is-
FR: It’s not smooth or-
TZ: -the path finding doesn’t often very
well, he goes right up to other characters
and then goes 90 degree angles around them
as opposed to doing nice splines - if he basically
doesn’t align himself precisely, if things
don’t snap right to his hand - if he can’t
actually operate things in believable fashion
then he doesn’t actually look intelligent,
even though under the scenes he’s still
able to search for this - he can still basically
go over to it, he can still utilize, he can
still create items, he can still send messages,
received messages, query the environment - all
that type of stuff and so one of the big issues
that we face before we really expose the AI
side of it is we want to make sure that a
lot of these - you could call them cosmetic
issues because they really predominantly isolated
from the AI itself although the solution to
them is occasionally quite complex because
they are still so tightly integrated.
By way of example, one we’ve talked about
before is you’ve got a path find and in
combat you’ve got a character and he’s
running towards cover and he actually needs
to know in the path find that he’s running
towards cover in a combat situation and then
he’s basically going to modify the end part
of that path find he’s running to that destination
by sliding into cover and if you’re talking
about a character that’s actually going
to manipulate something or sit in a chair,
they need to know how they are going to need
to be aligned so that while the path find
- the predecessor step an action, it can be
taking that into account so that because-
what you don’t want is for them to get to
the endpoint and then spin 80 degrees and
then basically to play the appropriate animation
and so the mission stuff is the first and
easiest but given the release schedule and
we can’t talk too much about that - we’ve
had some conversations about whether or not
we might have a small iterative release that
might expose some of this for testing purposes
but we’ll just have to talk about that as
we announce that later.
FR: Subsumption is really global, general
name so I think we’re probably- when the
mission system is out, well it’s part of
subsumption so there will be a part to experience
what subsumption is in general, right?
But, yes, as Tony says, most of the animation
issues are the one that.
we are basically working on to … before
we can show something.
Or not too much before we “can” show but
before we want to show ...
TZ: That’s exactly it.
FR: … because I think that’s the critical
part.
It’s like for me - I think we are both very
critical to the work we do - so it’s like
always say “ah, this doesn’t look very
good: I don’t want to show it”.
TZ: And this was one of the big things with
the Squadron 42 Vertical Slice to where one
of the largest issues was the animation integration
…
FR: Yeah.
TZ: … into the system.
As opposed to whether or not you were, under
the hood, actually doing all of the appropriate
AI logic.
The AI logic, a lot of it was …
FR: It’s … yeah, really a good point ...
TZ: … actually operational.
FR: … because the Subsumption logic … it’s
already … we have … in our game, our builds,
we already use the activities.
We already use sub-activities.
We already have secondary sub-activities surrounding
people say “Hi” to you or greet you, seeing
from far, having different activities ...
TZ: Right but we were having problems with
the heads weren’t orientating correctly
and ...
FR: But … exactly … if you showed something
like that ...
TZ: … to any user you show that …
FR: … yeah.
TZ: … it looks much more primitive than
that it really is.
And so that was one of the reasons why, up
until the very end, we were like “Well how
… how quickly can we tie up some of the
most egregious animations issues?”
FR: Because you gonna make sure … you want
to make sure something that can be very impressive,
it actually is.
Because otherwise if you ruin the look of
something that is actually quite complex,
quite advanced, with a bad look then it’s
hard to remove that type of first impression.
And it’s not smart and it’s like … I
don’t think it gives the right credit to
the system
TZ: We … we … we
FR: … and the developers that worked on
it.
TZ: … we want the quality of the animation
to match the ambition …
FR: The system.
Yeah.
TZ: … of the actual logic …
FR: The game.
TZ: … and that’s still going to require
… that’s still going to require some effort.
[17:42] 3.0 NPC AI
TZ: 3.0 I think we’re actually going to
aim for a pretty diverse set of things.
Most obviously would just be starting to make
the landing zones actually start to feel alive,
so that you encounter a variety of different
characters all pursuing their own particular
set of interests.
This will include everything from the prototypical
bartender and bar patrons, tourists, vandals,
businessmen…
FR: Shop.
TZ … yeah, various shop … shop keepers
... muggers, criminal elements: things of
that sort.
And then some of the … some of the more
interesting stuff in terms of the gameplay
potential, I would say, would be the combat
aspects.
FR: Because the combat is, of course, is what
I really worked on and it’s something I’m
really, really happy to work on and I want
to push it even further.
That is going to be interesting because we
try to make this first iteration on it where
there is already coordination between the
guys that fight.
People that can advance while somebody else
covers the advancement from a cover spot or
if no cover spot are allowed they will just
…
I think the main thing with the combat that
I’m really trying to push is the fact that
they understand the environment.
And you are sure.
And you understand that what they are doing
makes sense for the type of environment which
they are in.
And that is going to be what I think is cool
in this scenario because maybe you’ll find
some pirates on the side you want to get a
good deal but then they turn on you.
And then the fight makes interesting … the
situations …
TZ: And this will play into a number of things
so that when you encounter … like right
now the only ships, as you’re just generally
wandering around stuff, you tend to encounter
is really other players.
TFR: Yeah.
TZ: And that should be dramatically different
in 3.0.
Not only different in terms of you encountering
them but in terms of what you can do with
them.
If you disable … if you’re transporting
cargo and you basically get attacked by a
pirate and he disables your engines then it’s
entirely possible that he’s actually going
to try to board your ship.
Or vice versa if you’re a mercenary … if
you’re a pirate and you’re trying to take
out a freighter then part of what you’re
going to have to do is - after you disable
the ship - is board it and those characters
will actually be able to fight …
FR: Fight back.
TZ: … fight back within the confines of
their ship.
And this is, again, just going to open up
a world of possibilities in terms of making
the world, space, etc. feel much more alive.
FR: Kind of unique as well.
Because I think it creates these kinds of
scenarios that are not very easy to find somewhere
else.
It’s going to be a very interesting to see
how the players will play.
[20:36] Back In The Studio
CR: Thanks guys.
Hopefully that gives you a better sense of
the progress we’re making and gives you
an idea of how awesome the final version can
be.
As more and more of the features like the
AI and the mission system, locomotion for
player and AI come online and are implemented
into the game we’re able to unlock even
more opportunities to push the game even further
and create that first person universe that
Star Citizen is going to be.
SG: And we know that AI has been one of our
most asked about topics from the community
so we decided to open up the conversation
to the community and let Tony and Francesco
field some of your questions about how it
works.
[21:14] AI - Fan Q&A with Tony Zurovec & Francesco
Roccucci
Q: For NPC ships, are those under the control
of a single AI or will it be multiple AI working
together?
What are the challenges of this?
TZ: Multi-crew ships will operate fairly similarly
to the hierarchy ... the chain of command
that you’d see in a typical civilian or
military vessel in that you’ll have a captain
and the captain will tell the navigator where
he wants to go.
And the captain will basically tell the engineer
what to prioritise: whether he wants … needs
the weapon systems back online first or the
shield generators or the engines.
And he’ll dispatch the chief medical officer
to deal with medical problems in this area
or that area.
So it’s at a very high level.
I’ve said before we don’t want to be “Sim
Citizen”.
We don’t want to have too much micromanagement
in terms of control.
That’s not the type of game we are.
But the concept of being able to just generally
prioritise things and then to have your lieutenant
characters address those.
And this actually segues nicely into how players
are going to be integrated into the equation.
If you’ve got a captain and you’ve got
a navigator and you’ve got a chief medical
officer and you’ve got a chief engineer
and you’ve got a chief weapons officer,
and all this other stuff and then all of a
sudden the player wants to … one of your
player friends wants to deal with weapons
or deal with engineering then you’ll have
a very easy means of factoring in how the
other characters are going to interface with
them.
And what you’re going to wind up getting
out of this is a nice concise system to where
you can customise as much or as little as
you want.
You can have … you can recruit NPC characters
to do as much of the work, that you and your
friends don’t want to do, as is necessary
to accomplish the job.
FR: Yeah, gets you really moving away from
one behaviour for one ship.
So it’s really like each seat will be controlled
by the people - just one - to work on that
seat.
So I think there would be a really the crew
feeling working on the spaceship as Tony already
said.
I think that is the only way to give a bit
more realism in the sense like even if you
board a ship and the pilot is tries to still
bring the ship somewhere and you kill him
then you don’t want the spaceship has this
external behaviour still like drives automatically,
controls the turrets anyway.
You just want to really see that something
is there.
Another thing we also try is to make these
type of AI modules that you can buy and assign
to specific seats.
So you don’t have an actual crew member
sometime but you want to have a small computer
at that controls, turret for example.
So some stuff, maybe the medical officer,
cannot be substituted by computer but the
turret can have a controller … automatic
controller.
And if you just sit down then you can immediately
take control over things turn on and off.
And I think you as a player you are also able
to customise a bit how the ships automatically
responds to things.
Can be really cool because you can have just
like a combination of … that you can have
that already makes a huge difference between
one ship and another.
Q: What advantages/disadvantages would there
be in running an AI-crew versus an all-human
crew?
TZ: The advantages of AI crew versus human
crew?
I wouldn’t really say that there’s definative
advantages.
I would say the devil’s always in the details.
What you will have as a player is the ability
to recruit NPC characters to fulfil specific
jobs on your ship.
But when you basically go to recruit them,
that’s where the details start to matter.
How much are you willing to pay?
And that’s going to determine the level
of quality, the level of professionalism,
that you’re going to get from that particular
member.
If you want, a turret gunner that’s really
effective then you’re going to have to pay
a higher monthly salary.
You’re going to have a higher running cost,
and so what you’ll see a lot of players...
and the exact same scenario exists within
players: there’s some will be more adept
at a given occupation - a given skill - others
will be less capable, and so what I think
you’re going to wind up seeing in a lot
of cases is players - you may have a ship
that’s ideally crewed by 6 or 8 or 10 people
- and the player’s party will take on those
roles that they’re best at and then they’ll
recruit NPCs to whatever skill level they
can actually afford to fill in the remainder.
FR: Also about the interest right?
Because maybe some players have interest on
piloting, some others have really good interest
in shooting.
And then you can just use the AI to fit the
roles you don’t like too much.
But on the other hand the AI won’t rage
quit on you, right?
You won’t have like a player disconnecting,
so.
TZ: Yeah, but they
FR: You have an an advantage with AI?
...
TZ: Well and that's true.
All of the whereas most of the things that
players will actually do will depend upon
their actual capabilities, or their ship capabilities,
or their equipment's capabilities to expose
things.
But how, how well you basically can fire,
for example on another player, your accuracy,
that's determined by your physical dexterity,
and it's influenced by the weapon which may
have more or less kickback or a wider area
of effect in terms of it's damage, etc.
And NPCs will have a variety of characteristics
that will model how well they deal with all
of these different . . with all of these different
things that the player has to . . has to handle
themselves.
FR: Yeah the skills will be like definitely
be a huge part you know on deciding like this
NPC is good at doing every job or jobs.
But maybe you have two that are kind of good
at the same job, and you still need to fill
another role and you put the one.
They say, “Well, I still need the shield
management.”, and even if none of them is
pretty good but maybe after a certain amount
of missions.
Well he starts to get used to that, and he
starts to improve his skills as well.
You know you can decide, “Will pay a bit
less, but I risk a bit more in the beginning
at trying to make simple missions so they
get used to these things.
I think that is also like interesting to see
how the player will use their strategy to
put balance their hiring and the other NPC
they have with how they can improve and learn.
TZ: Yeah, it becomes another resource to manage.
Another way by which players can differentiate
their style of gameplay
FR: Yeah.
TZ: versus another.
Well it's like do you go with three engineers
of lower quality or one really stellar performer.
FR: Yeah.
TZ: So there's going to be a multitude of
ways for you to customize the game-play experience
via the choices you make in all of these different
areas.
Q: What do you anticipate to be the largest
ship capable of operating effectively with
an AI crew?
TZ: There's no real limitation just given
the distribution of responsibilities.
It would really just be more along the lines
of the larger ships will require larger crews
to operate effectively and therefore their
running costs on average will tend to be higher
than crew . . than ships that can be operated
with, with a much smaller crew.
Obviously you can modulate that to some degree
with the quality of the crew you're hiring
. .
FR: Yeah.
TZ: . . and things of that sort, but there's
no hard coded limit and there's surely no
reason why there would be given how all of
these tasks and responsibilities that they're
going to be executing are going to be ready.
FR: I think that is really like coming from
you know to the, to the fact that basically
within the individual behavior you know are
controlled by a captain or something like
that, but then each of these NPCs which is
do it's job.
So you know there is no real limit on the
amount of people that execute their job if
you know you have like five, six to control
five different turrets.
Well, you know, that would be just like five
different people.
Their coordination of course depends on the
amount of targets they have.
Who they can target, but then it doesn't matter
like if there are three or five or fifteen,
because you know the code would just give
for that would try and distribute the targets,
but so exact you know . .
TZ: But it would like as you go, as you go
to upper echelon of ships you are going to
probably need more experience . .
FR: Yeah.
TZ: . . better commanders, because they are
effectively going to be . . in control of
more . . of a larger number of crew members
and we would probably . .
FR: Yeah.
TZ: . . just model it such that if you basically
get a lower end . . a lower . . a lower quality
of chief engineer starts to basically buckle
under the pressure and he starts to make bad
decisions, etc.
.
FR: Yeah . . assigns wrong people . .
TZ: . . once he starts getting beyond three
or four or five guys that he is controlling.
The exact same thing you'd see in the real
world.
Q: What kind of relationships do you expect
us to develop with AI NPCs?
Will an NPC react differently to me based
on prior actions?
If I ruin a relationship with an NPC, will
there be ways to repair it afterward?
TZ: It's always been our intention to allow
the player to form long lasting relationships
with all of the characters in the game.
What this means specifically is that you will
develop what we call reputation in a number
of different fields.
Are you known for your acts of piracy?
Are you known for your humanitarian missions?
You're basically very medically oriented and
you are rescuing people, healing people, solving
medical crisis, you know etc.
Do you . . are you really well known for how
effective a transporter you are in terms of
commodity goods and things of that sort?
You have a high very . . a very high success
rate in terms of getting it done.
So there will be those reputational aspects
that characters will be able to . . you know
of yourself . . that characters will be able
to query to determine how much they like you,
dislike you, whether they want to offer you
the more advanced missions or just the starter
missions, what they are willing to pay you
in order to do that, etc.
There will also be these what I call these
many to one relationships to where it’s
not based upon your, you know, piracy rating
or your transportation rating…
it’s based on your specifically one to one
relationship.
How do they feel about you?
Did you take a specific mission from them?
That’s probably going to be weighted much
more significantly than stuff that they heard
that you did for other characters in the universe.
They will also be able to take into account
your… the organizations to which you’re
a part.
Do they like that organization?
Do they hate that organization?
Are they neutral to that organization?
So all of these things together are basically
variables that the characters within their
conversation logic can factor into how they
respond to you.
So… and then we’ll wind up having these
things gradually, you know, return to a baseline
if you don’t keep doing it.
Other words if you were an exceptional…
exceptionally good at transporting merchandise,
very high success rate.
If you haven’t done that in a day, in a
week, in a month…
then people will no longer be talking about
that behind the scenes, therefore you expect
that reputational aspect to gradually deteriorate
over time and you’re going to have to just…
you’re going to have to... basically going
to have to keep doing that type of thing and
keep doing it well if you want to maintain
your standing with the community in that regard.
FR: Yeah, so like for us for me especially
now on the AI team what we try to do is I
test all of these functionalities to make
sure that the AI can create as much content
as they can.
So like, you know, once we have these things,
the relationship variables or attributes it
is really like better to give these to the
designers and then the designers can use any
of these.
Can be the reputation, can be this… you
know, what they feel about you and they can
just create all the logic that they want.
Plus we have… we’re kinda in a unique
position because like the game can constantly
be updated so these characters can also get
new responses.
You know, based on the state and, you know,
and all the result is new content that we
can create with time that just makes, you
know, the relation always more smooth and
you know, we can go deeper into details and
mentioned other stuff that you’ve done,
mentioned events that have happened.
If I have a good relation with you maybe I
gossip about something with you and you know,
we can create this and always have more and
more and more.
TZ: There’s the stuff that really matters
in terms of the missions they give you whether
they’ll talk to you at all and that stuff.
Then there’s also just the more cosmetic
stuff where they tell you jokes or they’re
light hearted or they’re basically bantering
on about their history because they feel comfortable
with you because you’ve done three missions
with them within the last week.
Were they frowning at you as you go, were
they repulsed by you, were they disgusted
by you, you know.
All that type of stuff, so I would you say
you’ve got different elements coming together
which is, you know, not just how they explicitly
react to you but more just, you know, they’re
just… they’re more subtle behavioural
characteristics when, you know, when you’re
in proximity.
In conclusion, what are you most looking forward
to?
TZ: For the future AI I think that clearly
going to head more towards the algorithmic,
you know, generation of content that does
not mean by any stretch of the imagination…
we’ve said from the very beginning, it’s
like we don’t want to be pure algorithmic.
We have no interest in being purely algorithmic,
we don’t think that makes for a good gameplay
experience.
It just makes for good taglines in terms of,
‘ hey look, we’re giving you an arbitrarily
large of this’ but it’s all, you know,
it’s all bland and uninteresting.
There’s nothing really, you know, handcrafted
to draw you into it and so what we’ve been
pursuing for years now is basically the ability
to create all these handcrafted pieces and
then to allow the designers to build on top
of those to link those pieces together to
create very quickly what, you know, what seems
like incredibly customized missions but they’re
able to do it in much more rapid fashion than
what otherwise would be the case.
So, I think what we’re going to wind up
having is, you know, as you go forward is
just the ability to algorithmically create
more, you know, variations on those things.
You’re not really going to notice it in
terms of quality of the content, it's just
going to look like… it’s going to look
like you went from 12 designers dedicated
to this to 24-36 as you basically refine all
those algorithms and you start to get your
base library functions and stuff all entirely
operational.
FR: Yeah, the thing I think we can talk about
as well is like the way… the thing I would
always like to push forward is the kind of
realism is if you want to start to follow
one guy, for example, and we start with something
like the guy will leave the planet but maybe,
you know, eventually you have this guy like
change planets, you know and he’ll be able
to understand that there are connections between...you
know, jumping into space ship, then take the
spaceship to fly, quantum jump and then go
to this other planet and then go down and
search for another part.
You can just follow it and then you can be
always be more realistic like, you know, I
think that is from a tech perspective, you
know we’ll have of course some optimisation,
what you’re trading, stuff like this that
we want to have as quick as possible.
So I think there are like these two parallel
you know, work that we are doing both on the
content production tools to create always
more and give more feeling and all the technical
problems that we are trying to solve like
using objects while you use another object,
you know sitting on a spaceship and while
you are sitting you actually interact with
all the objects and each these interactions
triggers something else.
I think these of things that we are going
to eventually have... it’s the details,
it’s an amount of details that you will
eventually have based off all the iteration.
So first iteration will have, even on the
combat side, first iteration will have a sort
of coordination, but then these other iteration
will always have more and more coordination
using more type of weapons, being smart on
which type of weapon is best in this specific
environment or in a specific scenario.
I think this is just going to give always
more realistic feeling.
TZ: Yeah because another long term objective
and this is not within the next 12 months
it’s more of a 12-24 month window type of
thing is basically support for what we refer
to as the Persistent Dynamic NPCs and what
we mean by that is, of course there will be
specific characters at specific areas within
even the Persistent Universe, certainly within
Squadron 42, but we’ll have those characters
even within the Persistent Universe, and then
there will be another class of characters
that are just created as you want around the
world.
You encounter, you’re basically transporting
a load of commodities from one planet to a
refinery and you encounter a pirate and that
pirate winds up inflicting significant damage
and you wind up having to call for help and
once your help arrives you basically high
tail it and get out of there.
This is the kind of thing to where what we
want to eventually to be able to do is to
keep the essence of what that character was,
that pirate, what was his name, what does
he look like?
Was he talking to you on the radio, what voice
were we using for him, what was his rank?
What was the source of the interaction that
you had with him.
What’s your history?
He basically got the better of you in a battle
and then we want to be able to use that as
an input into this library of mission content
such that next time we’re looking for a
pirate to basically be utilized on one of
these mission archetypes, we have the possibility
to insert him as the specific character and
he then has the ability to refer back to that
prior history and so what you wind up having
is your own little custom version of the world
to where these are characters we didn’t
specifically go out and hand create and give
a history to, but you’re encountering them,
your interacting with them made them real,
made them persistent for you.
They’re also persistent for any party members
that you’ve got, it’s like everybody can
see them, but those particular characters
that you’ve interacted with in a certain
way become available for us to utilize when
we need an equivalent character as you encounter
lots of different scenarios within the game
world.
Final Thoughts
FR: Well I think that other things I also
look forward is when the wildlife on the planets,
that’s going to be really interesting because
it’s something I worked on a little bit
before.
In Crysis we had some little wildlife and
there’s always this big difference between
the smart wildlife and the more simplistic
wildlife.
If you have a frog, well you don’t expect
the frog to be super smart.
You can create this kind of, you know the
CryEngine word: Boids, animals that can move
around and they react to your presence or
your proximity much more.
Then you have other things like pets or even
just bigger animals like a deer or something
you know that they’re smarter and they need
to do something with you, they’re not as
complex as a human, but they’re pretty complex
and to give the actual feeling of planet,
we’ll have to tackle all of these things
and it's going to be very interesting.
TZ: Well, but it’s just like with the cities
to where you want to make this world that
you’re travelling through look as alive
and as interesting as possible because if…
like right now, i’m sure bothers us all
is the just the fact that we’ve got a great
big world, but we’re not yet able to effectively
populate it with a lot of interesting material
for the player to see, and we’ve talked
in the past about how we’ve got 17 missions
in the Persistent Universe that you can go
and accomplish, but those were implemented
in a completely different fashion than what
we’ve been aiming to eventually be able
to do, but these systems are such that you
need to have maybe not the entirely, but a
significant majority of the base functionality
operational before you have anything and so
what makes me most excited about 2017 is just
the fact that we should start get this stuff
that we’ve been talking about on the content
generation side finally into the game and
this is where all of a sudden the ability
for players to start do a variety of different
occupations and for them to just fly around,
orbit around a moon, content we didn’t explicitly
put there will be able to fill in, and then
there will be interesting stories and things
to do all littered throughout the entire system.
So I think that once we get 3.0, it’s supposed
to be the initial iteration of pushing this
stuff out there and then all the successive
releases are just going to be refining, refining,
basically taking advantage of this system
we’ve put in place.
I think that Star Citizen in 3.0x iterations
is going to finally start to look like a real
finished game to where you can just go in
and lose yourself for hours and hours at a
time and that’s not because you’re marveling
at just the technological ambition of the
project, it’s because there’s actually
enough gameplay content in there to keep you
interested.
FR: And for me it’s like, because after
where we have that, we can actually see how
the player plays with the game.
The most interesting thing for me working
on games is the fact that you produce something
that people actually play with and they interact
with, it’s not that you know you just give
it and it’s not that only, it’s really
how you use it, it’s how you play that,
and the game plays with you so I think at
that point you can also start to tweak things
say, “Ah this is how people like to do,
and the way they like to play”, and then
you can adjust things and give more content
here and I think that is going to be very
interesting.
TZ: I can foresee us using spectator mode
quite a bit to actually see how players are
interacting with all of this initial set of
mission concept.
FR: “Stalking Mode”.
Outro
SG: Always great to hear more about how NPC
crews are going to work.
It sounds like it's been a huge undertaking
to develop a system this complex.
CR: Yeah, no it’s definitely a huge undertaking
and we’re still hard at work at it, especially
Francesco and Tony.
We really want our NPCs to have complex behaviors
you would expect.
So the work Tony, Francesco, and the rest
of the AI team have been doing is vital to
our plan moving forward in creating this immersive
Star Citizen, and Squadron 42 first person
universe.
So once we have the foundation in place we’ll
be able to tie it into the mission manager
and the mission system itself and create some
really emergent and immersive scenarios either
by scripted design on the designer's side
or through sort of, systemic or procedural
generation that's in response to player or
AI behavior.
So I think it’s going to provide some really
cool and unique gameplay.
SG: Cool, with that brings us to this episode
of ATV, and as always we’d like to thank
our subscribers for contributing to the creation
of all our in depth behind the scenes concept.
CR: Yup, thank you guys very much.
I thank you for having patience for us being
here and doing all of this and a huge thanks
to all of our backers who are supporting Star
Citizen's development.
You guys are a big part of what makes the
project unique and special and we definitely
could not do it without you guys so thank
you very, very much.
SG: We could not, and if you would like to
hang out with more of the team make sure to
tune in tomorrow at 10am Pacific for the latest
Star Citizen Happy Hour stream to watch some
live gameplay and discussion.
CR: Yes.
I’m not quite sure which one of our devs
will be there, but they’ll be there and
it’s kind of a cool opportunity to have
an informal Q&A and discussion, but until
then.
SG: We will see you.
Both: Around
the Verse.
