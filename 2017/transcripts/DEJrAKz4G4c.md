everyone welcome to mug smashers I'm
your host Marc Abraham's I'm not on
vacation this week so as I take a sip
for my coffee tea company cup Spencer
what you got for me I hate you it's mug
slashers so this week we've got an
insurance bug I talked about it briefly
on a TV a few weeks ago but this one's
pretty funny you you claim insurance on
the ship you go and spawn it and then
your Pierce right on the landing
pad but there's no seats there's no
doors there's no landing gear this is a
really scummy insurance company and they
did the bare minimum so basically like
real life insurance yeah we were trying
to really realistic you're too realistic
for a game yeah so how about do we uh we
step into this and I show you what's
wrong hello everybody and welcome to
learn of sort of bugs
slashers the show where I refuse to let
that joke die this week got an
interesting book to show you you may
have seen this on burned down a few
weeks ago I talked a little bit about it
but I wanted to go into a bit more depth
about how we solve this problem and
explain why it was happening so here we
are and we just jump right in and show
you so we're gonna go over here to our
terminal we're gonna make a claim on a
ship we're going with the Cutlass black
today just run go make the claim on this
ship and they're gonna expedite it yep
eight seconds maybe a little bit shorter
than what you'd expect to wait in the
live version
okay so we've we've claimed our ship and
now that we wait for the time to finish
now we're gonna go and spawn it
let's not retrieve this
[Music]
okay and for the sake of time we're just
gonna fly out here and it should
probably be immediately noticeable
what's wrong here I've spawned the ship
there is no doors there's no landing
gear you fly inside there's no seats and
you know what there's no turret on top
either
this sham of an insurance company took
our money and we get basically a ship on
cinder blocks that does not work you
cannot fly this it's just a husk of a
ship and as you might imagine this not
the the best feature to have so what
went wrong why did this happen to us
let me explain so we're gonna pause here
we're gonna do hop into our code and
we're gonna look at a function called
generate persistent items and this lives
in a piece of code called the
entitlement processor which is a really
important part of our code base what the
entitlement processor does is when you
start up the game we'll say for the
first time after you've bought on the
ship on the website you bought and you
know whatever cutlass Hornet when you
sign the first game we need to take this
data of this ship that you own and
basically translate it into game data so
that you could persist it it could be in
the air player database so that the game
knows you own this Cutlass really
important and it's a pretty
sophisticated piece of code there's a
bunch of stuff going on in here to make
sure that things get sorted properly and
players own the things that they need to
and what we're gonna do for insurance
we're going to use some of the
functionality already here so that when
you insure a ship and you blow it up and
you make a claim you get a brand new one
and it uses the same code path here but
we are gonna have to make a few slight
modifications because the code wasn't
really intended to do this exactly we're
kind of hijacking into doing what we
want sort of a clever solution but as
you'll see with many bugs it always
starts off with all right so we tried to
be clever and then this happened so
let's talk a bit about in this function
and how
using it now generating persistent items
is a recursive function which if you're
not familiar with computer science
you're probably familiar with this sort
of image and I'm going to have a helper
here I'm gonna drag OBS over here
this is recursion when you see something
that contains itself and in computer
science if you have a piece of code you
know a function that calls itself which
calls itself which calls itself and ad
infinitum just keeps happening and it's
a really useful piece of tech and that's
what the generate persistent items does
because when you have an item you have a
route and you have a tree of things that
are its children I've got a helper image
here because way more sophisticated than
regular bug smashers when I'm hosting
the show and as you can tell clearly
made with my amazing art skills in
mspaint
um there's a reason why I'm not sitting
on the other side of this building in
the art department right so this is the
item port tree for our Cutlass black or
a rough approximation of it to give you
an idea of how this works and I know you
might be expecting code we're gonna jump
into the code right after this but let
me explain a bit about how this set up
is so we've got our route here which is
the ship which has no doors nothing on
it it's basically just the model of only
the ship and this is the parent this is
the route and then you see attached to
that on item ports the seats the turret
the doors and those things that are
attached can also have things attached
to them so the turret has guns attached
to it the seat is the dashboard that has
to it right so this is the tree
structure this is how things are set up
like our ships and this is very
important because the entitlement
processor starts at the top and then
gives you that ship and then will give
you all of its children all the
children's children now when we're doing
this function for insurance purposes
we're basically building a list of all
of the pieces so that we can give you
all the pieces individually and if we
hop back into our code here you can see
what we're doing here is we're
generating a list
of all these items were pushing it back
into this list and very crucially we
need to keep track of each of these
items parents so if you look at this
image again we need to know that the
seat its parent is just the ship itself
now we're gonna jump on to image number
two here where I've labeled all these
images here and given them an ID so you
can see we start at the root like
alright this is zero in computer science
we start at zero not one for many
reasons but anyway we start at zero and
okay go down children it's one it's
children to go back up alright then I
need three okay back up for its children
five six back up seven okay right so
that's the order that we number all of
these and give them IDs and that's what
the entitlement processor does the
problem that we run into when using this
function for insurance I can hop in here
and show you we were storing this ID in
this variable here item the ID right
there now in that variable every time we
do this for coos recursive loop we add
one to that variable and basically this
is used to give new entity IDs to these
entities when they are spawned so you
make an entity you make its children you
add one it's ID is one higher it's
children one higher than that this
doesn't work for our purposes because
we're storing a slightly different
number in that variable rather than the
entity ID we're storing the offset in
the list the IDS that were on the this
image here is their offset the problem
here is we were sending these numbers
but really we need the parent of those
numbers because of what we do later on
in insurance here we want the parent
number and so in my final image here I'm
going to show you the numbers we're
supposed to have instead of just putting
the ID of the part itself which is what
we were doing we're basically saying oh
my parent is just the same number as me
so it would entitle you all these pieces
of the ship but then not know how to
connect them back
together seeds spawn the ship and it
would just be the root of it and all the
other pieces would be in your persistent
database but they're not connected to
the ship they have no knowledge of each
other so they're just sort of floating
out there in space metaphorically
speaking anyway so if we look at our
orange number here this is going to
represent the parent that this belongs
to and so we start at the root here
doesn't really have a parent so we're
gonna keep that zero but then for each
of its children it's like okay well I'm
number one but my parent was zero like
I'm number three but my parent was zero
we're down here I'm number five but my
parent was four and so on so this is
really crucial this is the number that
we use later to say okay I know where my
parent is in this list we can connect
them all back together so let me show
you the code that we did to change this
it's not very much but sometimes really
complicated bugs get solved in just a
small amount of code so I'm gonna copy
and paste a little bit of code that I
had saved here and we're just going to
put this there right so
we've got this one little block here
which is checking to see if this
variable is negative one probably should
have started with we're going to modify
the function very slightly and it's a
ton of arguments we got to scroll all
the way to the side here and we're going
to add an argument to this function
called envy list parent index as the
orange number we were talking about
you're gonna add that to the header here
I'm gonna default value it's a negative
one this we're gonna put this in the
source file as well okay so now we've
got an extra argument to this function
we need this number to keep track of the
parent as I mentioned earlier now this
little block of code down here that I
accidentally copy and paste it to early
is now checking to see if this isn't
negative one I'll get back to that and
then if it's not if we know that we want
to be tracking this information we know
that we entered this piece of code
through insurance and so we're just
going to store that in that variable I
mentioned earlier right okay the reason
we're checking if it's not equal to
negative one is because we're trying to
do several things at the same time here
with this function if there's several
different code paths that lead here we
only want insurance to be taking
advantage of this feature basically so
we default this value to negative one
negative one and you it did that default
that value the negative one and we just
ignore it if it is that but if it's not
negative one we know we want to take
track keep track of this information
okay so we've got that small bit of code
down there and then down here this is a
little bit of a funky line I'm gonna
type out here so we're gonna make an
event here we're gonna call it new
parent new parent index in entity list
because I like my variables to be a
mouthful okay now this will look a
little bit weird over hid
index not equal to negative one
just like I said before you have to
check that make sure that we are
tracking this information okay so if
that's true no Larry ternary operator
here I'm just going to keep typing this
and explain it in a minute
okay we've got this little bit of a mess
here but basically what we're tracking
is are we tracking the parent index like
I mentioned earlier we are tracking it
and if this pointer here is not null we
need to access it so we got a checks not
null then if both of those are true we
are going to take that number that we
were keeping track over I GID do you
reference it 2-1 because remember we
started at 0 and if it wasn't true we're
just gonna return negative 1 and then
this integer we just created here goes
as the new argument that we just added
here new parent index entity list which
is the thing that we added to this
function and that we checked up here
this is the new value and this is why
recursion is cool because we've made
this value on a parent we're gonna go
back to our image here we've made that
value here and propagate it to each of
its children make the value here
propagate to the children
same thing here make the value that you
call that recursive function and you
give it to its children and that's
what's really powerful about recursion
is super quick to make a change like
this okay so we've got that in there and
now we have what should be everything we
need to compile this and try try again
maybe this time have a halfway-decent
insurance company take care of us I know
we're trying to be a realistic game but
I think the insurance company should
actually give you a working ship and
we'll cut back after this finishes
compiling alright we're back in game now
so let's let's try again let's make
another claim and hopefully now maybe
we're being insured by a less seedy
organization let's make a claim on our
Cutlass black here
pay our expedited fee and now we're
gonna wait a little bit for this to
finish up will spawn our ship and
hopefully the good as new
do a little dance okay
that's probably ten seconds all right
we're free of our ship
yeah and I'm just gonna fly out of here
for the sake of time and can see hey
we've got doors this time and not only
doors we've got turrets
we've got engines we got seats the whole
kit and caboodle this is an actual ship
didn't show up on cinder blocks this
time either
cool so just to recap to put it quickly
before we were keeping track of the list
of all of these new items we needed to
give to the player when they claimed
insurance and when trying to keep track
of which item had which parent we were
not sending the right ID so we needed to
get a new ID and propagate that down
each the children during each of our
recursive calls and that is what allowed
us to attach everything when we spawn
the ship and now you've got something
that's good as new hopefully you guys
enjoyed this episode and our little bit
of a less Kody approach to it using
images and more just descriptions of the
problem and that's it we could vote for
buck slashes below ok so insurance was a
bit out of whack and gave us some pretty
unusable ships but we went in there and
made sure that each new thing in the
item port tree knew correctly about what
its parent was when we put it out on the
list and then gave all that stuff to the
player again so now your ships work no
more janky insurance company that rips
you off
and note don't say I know you want to
say it how's the weather from down there
I really hate you so that's this week's
episode of bug smashers I'm your host
