Hello and welcome to another episode of
Around the Verse, our weekly look at
Star Citizen's ongoing development. I'm
Sandy Gardner and I'm Chris Roberts. So
today we're going to take a look at the
work that went into creating engine
trails, atmospheric entry effects, and
some of the other cool visuals uh we are
planning for 3.0. But first, let's head
to Austin for a studio update.
Hey guys, Jake Ross here, producer in
Austin. The wheels are in motion on
several features here in Austin. Let's
dive right in and see what's been going
on this month. On the design side, we've
been doing a new pass on the proc fixer
tool, which is the master Excel sheet
where all of our pricing structure is
laid out. We've got a bunch of new
assets that have come online and our
designer working on it, Pete McKay, uh,
has all the new ships, new items, new
armor suits, and some other FPS goodies.
So, Pete has been working to make sure
they all fall within the pricing balance
of the game, as well as balancing them
to the most recent design pass of the
items. What's really exciting about this
now, as opposed to 6 months ago, is that
we're getting far enough with the
overall design of the items in the game
to better understand the gameplay
implication of the items. Although this
has required us to go back and make
another pass through the items to bring
older items in line, we're now able to
more accurately predict where their base
prices should sit. On top of this, as we
are getting new missions in the game, we
are doing an additional pass on mission
rewards, insurance prices, and respawn
timers. We are also setting up the shop
inventories utilizing the new shop tech
from LA Engineering Team. In addition,
we are getting NPCs into some of the
main hub areas of our PU landing zones.
Uh, junior designer Robert Gaither has
been focusing on Grim Hex in order to
prove out the behaviors. Uh, but the
plan is to extend these general
behaviors to the other landing zones
like Port Olsar and Levki. The overall
goal here is to start to create a
general sense of ambience and start to
bring the levels to life. Finally, we
have Miles Ehart. Getting Miles Ehart,
our mission giver, into the game has
required a lot of collaboration and work
from several different teams. The
usables team has created the tech that
allows us to link extraneous objects
such as the bar stool to other usables,
the high bar table, and still register
items on the table properly, such as
Echart's glass. The mission system team
has given us the ability to look for
missions with the Echart tag, figure out
what is currently available for players,
and pass those via subumption to the
player's mission log for acceptance or
rejection. Between the AI and FPS
programmers, they have created an
animation technique we're calling
feather blending that will allow us to
blend between usable object animations,
such as a generic sitting animation for
a bar stool and the animations related
to the mission giver conversations. The
Subsumption tech and programming team
have been facilitating all of this
through the Subsumption tools and by the
game code that goes with it. Overall,
we've made a lot of progress in the last
few weeks and we are looking forward to
polishing this up for the 3.0 release.
On the art side of things here in
Austin, Josh Coons, our ship artist, has
been working with the tech art team to
finish creating the LODs and the damage
pass of the Compass Black. He was also
busy making tweaks to the cockpit area
and the rotating necess based on the
tech art feedback and wishes. He has now
moved on to creating an awesome looking
renders and videos which will be used on
the website and various marketing
events.
We can now say that the formerly top
secret project that lead ship artist
Chris Smith has been working on is the
Gian Knox bike. Starting around March,
he has been tirelessly modeling and
texturing uh this bike from the
beginning to the end. In the last month,
he has been working with many team
members on creating the incredible
artwork for the brochure and slick
marketing release video for this new
ship, as well as an interview on how it
all came together. The server
engineering team has been working
closely with DevOps to integrate and
test diffusion in a QA environment. So
far things are looking good. The team
has started working with gameplay
engineering to show them how to best
utilize the features that diffusion can
offer. We will continue to work with
them over the next few months to
identify new and old gameplay features
that will be best suited as diffusion
services. In time we will move much more
of the feature logic in diffusion
services allowing for higher scalability
and optimal perform performance. This
month in the PU animation team we are
starting on the NPC usables for
counters. This will include working with
our shopkeepers and bartenders NPCs and
collaborating with designing to bring
these elements to life. Once these are
complete, a player would be able to walk
into a shop to buy merchandise from NPCs
that sell weapons, spacuits, clothing,
ship parts, and other such things. This
will incorporate our Wildline system as
well with face animation and audio
captured at our mocap shoots. To
complete these features, we needed to
capture a few transition elements that
were missing. So, we shuffled some desks
around and set up a quick mocap shoot in
our office. Along with the bartender, we
are also getting the usable for the bar
stool up and running. Once this is done,
a player will be able to go and sit at a
bar stool and order a drink. Finally, we
finished the carry system animations. As
a player, you can now pick up a
standardized box and walk around with
it. So, now we have all the needed tech
to expand this mechanic to pick up a
wide range of things and carry it
wherever needed. On the ship animation
side in Austin, we are wrapping up
setting up the standard for the cockpit
experience, as well as polishing and
creating new improved animations for our
next release. In addition to various bug
fixes within the cockpit, we are working
with the design and programming teams to
bring the same level interactions you
get in the cockpits to the man turrets
in the ships. This includes geforce
reactions, hit reactions, as well as a
G-lock pass out and wake up sequence for
when you're pulling too many G's.
The DevOps team is quietly adding more
hardware and increasing network capacity
to handle necessary increase in build
activity connected to the 30 release.
Everything is growing in size, which
means increasing demands on the build
system and its various subsystems.
Meanwhile, the live ops team has
completed the build out of the latest
server size expansion, supporting the
latest rev of shopping and subumption.
They're still tuning and making
adjustments, but it's always excited to
exciting to see the new services coming
online. For June, Austin QA has been all
hands- on deck, testing new features in
preparing for 300. Major testing items
for our group include new overhauled
Star Marine weapons, testing of the
Crusader moons, Levki, new missions, the
improved Moby Glass interface and apps,
particularly the star map, and ships.
Lots of ships. Many ships have come
online for item 2. So, each of them
requires a complete sweep for issues, as
well as a review of old issues such as
animation and ship idling to see what
may have carried over in the new
implementation. Stability and
performance has been a major focus as
well with Austin QA working closely with
our UK counterparts to conduct regular
play tests and captures. Two42 testing
has been working closely with the rest
of the team as new tech means new bugs
that are often shared between both
groups of testers. We've continued
providing additional support for the
animation team here in Austin as well,
handling mocap file cleanup, supporting
setup and tear down for pickup shoots,
and other tasks that free up our
animators to handle the more important
items. Our normal engine and editor
testing has kicked into high gear as the
surge of new tools and tech from
developers at all four studios means we
are constantly checking shelf check-ins
and binaries for problems. Making sure
everything is ready to go before it gets
checked in and turned over to the rest
of the company to use is very important.
This has included changes to resource
manage management for objects and
planets, new build distribution tools,
server changes to support subumption, as
well as network code improvements and a
refactor of the material manager.
The player relations team continues to
prepare for upcoming 3 work and can't
wait to give to the backers the new
player experience that will go on the
website and match the new content coming
up in the game. They'll also be adding
to the Evocati ranks in the coming weeks
and are excited to announce two new
hires in addition to more headcount in
Austin Manchester and our Frankfurt
studio. Work continues at a breakneck
pace and so does our excitement about
the upcoming release. Thanks for tuning
in and for all your support. See you
guys in the
verse. Hey guys, this is Benuel with
Turbulent and this is our update. So
we've moved 036A version of Spectrum up
to the PTU for regression testing. This
first first release in this branch is
only for testing all of the backend
changes that we've made in order to
we're preparing the groundwork for
desktop integration. And so we've
changed all of our actions which are the
core of how this application is
functioning. So we've transferred to a
new standard. This will help us manage
how we we do desktop uh release of
spectrum which will be able to have a
window in the overlay and a window on
your desktop at the same time but by
sharing all the resources. And so this
is we're laying the groundwork for this.
So this first release on PTU is only for
regression testing and uh we're going to
be throwing in new features into 036.
The first one being the new form editor
and so we're introducing uh drafts. Uh
so when you create new posts in a thread
uh we will uh save your draft so you can
go and back to browsing and then come
back and complete your draft for every
thread. Uh we're going to allow you to
do inline images. And so uh we we're
changing all of the way the markup
processing is working in the editor,
adding more markdown support for more
styling like styling of links, inline
images, uh so you're not forced to use
the frame that we have for all the
images or when you make galleries. And
so that's gonna we're hoping that this
uh is what you guys wanted. So, uh,
we've done a lot of work on the editor
on that front. Uh, another major feature
in, uh, 036A is custom roles. That's the
big feature. And so, we've been working
hard at creating the new member lists
that you can see directly from your
spectrum, uh, or management part. Uh,
then you'll be able to change roles of
your users, uh, you know, simply by
visiting their profiles. And so the
custom roles system basically allow you
to create new roles that have their
custom set of permissions on top of the
ones that are provided by the org
system. And so this should give you guys
a lot of flexibility in how you assign
people to groups uh how you let them see
specific sub forums or sub chats uh
within your orgs. What goes with this is
also an update to mini profiles. We're
not happy with the way mini profiles
have been working uh up to now and so
we've been changing that. Uh so we're
going to a more compact setup that will
have a set of actions uh on all of them.
Uh one thing that we're trying to
implement at the same time as we're
bringing these new uh member profiles in
is we're going to be reimpporting we're
reimplementing post counts. And so now
you'll be able to see post counts uh for
all the users on the system. So you'll
be able to see how many posts they've
made, how many replies they've created.
Uh and we're also introducing the
concept of karma. Uh so when people
upvote content that you've created, you
gain karma and that is uh that is shown
in in your spectrum mini profile. This
new succinct profile also will have an
hot link to message people. So you don't
have to click on them and click on
bright message. You can just message
them directly. So this this is our 036
version. We're going to be starting to
merge our branches very soon. More
ground work on the back end on voice. Uh
so we're really hard at work right now
working the transmission part of our
voice infrastructure. how we're going to
be able to have, you know, servers
directing and routing people to
different voice servers, how that's
going to work and what kind of data
channel we're going to have because we
have additional data to carry uh in this
project, not just voice. And so we need
to be able to carry these data channels
as well. And so we're we're looking at
how we're going to be doing that. So
there's a lot of there's resources
dedicated to that right now. Totally
unrelated to Spectrum, we've been
working for 3 uh for a new uh system to
handle crashes. We've we've developed
years ago uh a system called panic that
tracks your client crashes and so uh we
needed to basically reintegrate that to
be get more visibility on it. And so
we've integrated our panic system uh
with the Sentry which uh which is a
super nice UI that we're using on the
Spectrum side already but that we're now
going to be using on the game side uh
that will allow us to track your client
crashes you know see the repro counts
assign those to developers link them to
JR issues uh view regression so we get
regression notifications and all this
stuff uh from the game crashes. Uh so
we've developed a custom SDK integration
with Sentry. Uh it's going to be super
good for testing. It's going to help
developers in the testing phases for 3.
So we're super excited about that cuz
that work is completed. Um otherwise our
main teams are working on welcome to SC
the new uh Star Citizen website revamp.
And so uh that's progressing. We're now
in full coding mode. Uh most of the
design work is finished on all you know
mobile and tablets and everything. And
so we're right now we're developing and
so we don't have anything to show yet
but you know soon hopefully. And so, uh,
that's our turbine and update for this
this month. Thank you guys.
Cutless Blacks looking pretty good. Josh
has done a great job updating the ship.
Yeah. No, he definitely has. I mean, the
ship team in Austin's killing it. Chris
Smith recently finished the Knox, which
went on sale uh this past uh Friday and
uh, you know, it's pretty much done.
We've been flying it around on moons and
we're looking forward to getting in your
guys' hands in the very near future. So
the but I would say the incredible
attention uh does not stop just at
ships. Our VFX team has been hard at
work to get other cool effects like
engine trails ready for the 3.0 release.
Let's catch up with our VFX team to see
all the impressive effects they've been
creating.
I'm Mike Snowden. I'm the visual effects
director. We get to play with lots of
particles of which there are many uh in
Star Citizen from a kind of whisper of
steam from a mug on a table to a capital
ship exploding. There'll be effects
needed for both of those things and
anything in between as well. The
challenge with VFX is is maintaining
that the level of fidelity, the kind of
quality, the visual quality that that
that Star Citizen requires. Maintaining
that across that kind of range of scale,
seeing these kind of things up close
versus seeing them way way off in the
distance and making sure they always
look good. Uh there's lots of challenges
both artistically but also um
optimization wise as well making sure
that they run efficiently in the game.
I'm currently setting up the the engine
trails and entry and and um exit effects
for the atmosphere. Basically guys going
through each ship um setting up the
particle libraries for each ship and
setting the correct color values for
each manufacturer. Chris was a is a big
fan of the engine trails um for gameplay
reasons primarily but you know it's
something that is very much a part of
the Star Citizen dream I guess um he
always kind of saw the engine trails
being a part of that there's also going
to be atmospheric entry effects for
ships and anything actually not just
ships but objects that are passing
through atmosphere exit effects as well
when ships are actually leaving the
atmosphere contrails when vehicles and
ships are moving around at speed on the
planets so those are the three kind of
things that we think about when we're
talking about atmospheric flight
effects. When we were looking at the
challenges that things like engine
trails were going to give us, we
essentially knew that we couldn't really
do it with the current tech we've got.
Um, we had various attempts at doing so.
We essentially identified what the
problems were with the current tech. All
kinds of things really. The old system
was uh completely uh based on one
thread. So, it's a very linear system.
Started very small and was built upon
built upon and it became kind of a a
monster. I was jumping from one part to
the other part to the other part and it
was really was a mess. The old
system was
computing each particle on the CPU each
frame and then it had to sort of
download all this data to the G graphic
card every frame. To make these engine
trails a reality in in Star Citizen, we
had to bring together a team of people.
It's not something that we could solve
on our own as VFX artists. So we had to
involve um graphics programmers to give
us the features that our editor needs
that we to kind of build these kind of
engine trails. Lots and lots of
particles for for example. So one thing
that we didn't have in the editor was
GPU particles with the support of the
tech team and the code team. We're all
working together to generate this this
GPU particle system which is essentially
the driving force of these trails and
entry and exit effects because at the
moment we can only put a certain amount
of CPU particles on screen before it
affects the CPU. Of course to speed up
the system we have to reorganize the
design uh based on how how a modern
modern PC works. Data can take like a
slow path and a fast path. And part of
this is also to reduce the amount of
data that the CPU has to upload to the
GPU each frame. We can do it in a way
where we only uploads when when the
particle is born, the data gets
uploaded. In some cases, we don't even
have to the the data just need to be
uploaded once and then it can sort of
manage it itself on on the GPU without
the the C CPU have to having to
intervene very much. we have we have
these two concept of uh deterministic
and non-deterministic
uh particles well not deterministic and
nondeterministic states and the most of
the states are deterministic which means
that you you only need to upload them on
birth well maybe some states can even
state buffers can even be shared among
uh multiple uh emitters and emitters is
the the point or the area where new
particles get get spawned from. So, so
by separate doing this separation, you
only need to update the states that are
nondeterministic for all the other
states. Well, you still need to know the
state as a particular point in time, but
but it's much faster to to compute. You
not don't actually need to store the
state. you can just sort of uh derive
these formulas making those trails
behave correctly through the gameplay
and kind of react to what the ship's
doing. That's where we needed the the
game coder to um give us the kind of the
hooks to trigger these effects. The code
I write is made very generic. So, uh
it's made so that all kinds of particles
can be set up. So currently we're using
the the engine trails as a test for this
system, but it's supposed to cater to
every kind of particle you can imagine.
If it needs to be enabled, disabled, or
the strength adjusted during game play,
then the system should be able to handle
that. I built up the system completely
with data forge live preview in mind. So
whenever you change anything in data
forge, everything will be reloaded, will
be adjusted to whatever you've set in
data forge. So the game will have a live
preview as the the feature says. So it
allows VFX artists to more easily
iterate over their VFX setup. Most of
the time VFX artists will say like this
should change a little bit. This should
be thicker or thinner. It should be
different. Then uh either I make it
possible for them to do it themselves.
So add a property to data forge. So so
they can uh drag a slider make it
thinner or thicker. But uh sometimes
I'll have to go in code get some other
strength from uh like the thrust source
strength or the boost strength and add
it in a formula so they can use it
better. When all the effects are
complete that we will be able to lay
down the foundation of setting up new
effects. Today for example I I finished
the code for first iteration of
collisions. Nondeterministic particles
can like yeah you can shoot them into a
scene and it will bounce off the the
geometry in the scene. We have another
feature and that's fields. It's a way to
to compute the field around around the
geometrical shape. So we we want to use
this on on the ships. when you pass when
you pass through particles, they will
sort of get transformed along the field.
The great thing about um engine trails
and atmosphere is that even on the
moons, it's going to be an atmosphere.
Um so you're going to see in 3.0,
there's going to be the three moons. Um
they're going to have certain levels of
atmosphere. They'll they'll vary, but
you know, you're going to get some
really nice kind of subtle atmospheric
entry effects. with engine trails.
Knowing where someone is is going to be
so useful if you're flying around in a
group, if you're, you know, not
necessarily fighting against each other,
if you're just flying around in a in a
convoy or whatever, it's going to be
really nice to be able to see where
people are going. But also in combat as
well, you're going to get a nice sense
of kind of the visceral sense, I guess,
with engine trails. That's going to
provide quite a different experience to
what we've currently got. For the
player, they will notice this is the
performance is is much better. With this
new system, you can have I don't know
you can have 10 or 100 of this effect
and it still runs. Uh also we will have
certain GPU features that wasn't just
wasn't possible and it wasn't
implemented in the whole system and in
general our intention is that the the
visual quality will be yeah much much
better. It would be much cooler, much
more dynamic effects. It's really great
to be able to focus on um really cool
new things that we can use again ac
across the game really. The the hooks
that we've got from game code now are
going to help us drive all kinds of new
new features and effects. The graphics
side of things. The the new the new
particle system itself is going to
enable us to kind of create more stuff
as well. So where we had maybe 100
sparks before, we're going to be able to
have a thousand sparks. And as a VFX
artist, it's kind of exciting to be able
to do that, especially on the scope of
our game.
[Music]
Wow. Okay. So, pretty cool. Um, you
know, we built a whole new uh GPU
particle system so we can have, you
know, thousands, hundreds of thousands,
even millions of particles uh in a way
that the old CPU system uh couldn't
handle. And one of the main reasons for
this was to be able to do things like
engine trails, contrails, and various
other effects that require, you know, a
high amount of particles. And I I really
think it'll make a big difference to
space combat when you can sort of see
the well, even in the atmospheric
combat, you can see where the ships are
moving and what direction they're going.
And you, it's almost like you have a
pretty cool vista. We showed it in some
of the B-roll where you could sort of
see this battle happening in the
distance and engine trails and
explosions. and I think it'll add a lot
to the texture of space combat in Star
Citizen and also Squadron 42. Um, so
that's uh some of the cool stuff that's
made possible by you guys. And that's it
for today's episode. Thanks to all of
our backers. It's your support that
allows us to build the game we've always
dreamed of. Yes. And thanks to our
subscribers for making shows like this
possible. July subscribers ship of the
month will be the consolation. So be
sure to crew up and take it out for a
spin. Last month's ship, the
Caterpillar, will be on sale for
subscribers this weekend only. So, grab
yours before it's too late. Yes. And
don't forget to tune in tomorrow for a
special happy hour where the community
team will be answering your burning
questions. Hopefully, I'm not sure if
that's about entry or re-entry or
whatever um about Star Citizen. And
until next week, we'll see you around
the verse.
