Chris Roberts (CR): Hello and welcome another
edition of 10 for the Chairman.
Not quite as frequent as we’ve done in the
past, but there’s a lot of other things
going on so it’s not so easy for me to do
them and also we’re deep in development
on a whole bunch of big features for this
year and today we have a special guest with
me on 10 for the Chairman Tony Zurovec, the
Director of the Persistent Universe who will
be here asking or answering the 10 questions
asked by you guys and we’ve done a bit of
a departure now which I hope you guys will
like, but the key here is that we’re allowing
everyone to vote on the questions.
So as part of Spectrum which is the new platform
that we’re rolling out for our forums and
communication like chat and ultimately do
VOIP, it has the ability to upvote questions
or posts or threads and so I know it’s been
a common complaint that well you didn’t
answer this question we wanted answered, that
was a silly question to pick or answer or
why do people ask these basic questions.
Well now everyone has an opportunity to vote
on the questions they want to have answered
and may the best questions win.
So it’s very important for all you subscribers
to, if you care about having questions answered
that you’re interested in, go out and vote
when we run these because we'll be sort of
running these on Spectrum, not just for 10
for the Chairman, but a bunch of other stuff.
We’re building more and more features to
sort of support the ability to upvote and
sort of, highlight content that you’re all
interested in.
One of the next stages we’ll be rolling
out, a new Reddit/stackoverflow thread ordering
which also works on the same idea which is
one of the reasons why I think a lot of people
in our community use Reddit because it’s
easy to figure out what people are interested
in or where most of the heat or most of the
conversation is at.
So it’s very important for you guys to be
involved in this.
It’s also good for us, certainly for Jared,
and Ben, and the rest of the community team
because they get blamed for picking the wrong
questions.
Now the people out there whose fault for the
top questions will be you guys!
So make sure you vote well and the only thing
I’ll say is we’ve taken the top 10 questions,
there were two that me and Tony went through
all the stuff in the order of the highest
votes to the lowest votes and there were a
couple that we didn’t feel like we would
be able to give a very good answer too at
this period so we haven’t answered those
ones.
So there’s two that would have been in the
top 10 that aren’t answered, but other than
that we are answering it in the reverse order
of the most votes.
So the last question we answer will be the
one you voted the most for and the first one
will be the 10th most voted for of the ones
that we felt like we could answer.
So having said that, hopefully you guys will
find it interesting and it’s kind of a fun
process Tony and I because we get to discuss
things that we’ve have plans for or there’s
been a lot of design and even some implementation
on, it’s good to always reconnect and make
sure we’re all on the same page and go from
there.
So the first question, number 10 comes from...
[3:56] Klepto asks: Will Items and Cargo on
Planets be in a visible Storehouse or will
they “disappear” somewhere?
TZ: You want to take that?
CR: You want me to take that one, cause I’m
Mr….
I like the visual stuff.
So, from the standpoint of the way we’re
going to run it is there’s going to be a
visual indication in the appropriate sort
of commodities places, not all commodities
places necessarily will have a warehouse window
you can see.
A lot of them will and I really want that
sort of feeling that maybe you had a privateer
when you went to the commodities exchange
and you can see crates or boxes of the things
that you can buy.
Now, of course, if we’re on a planet and
there’s ten thousand tons of something we
obviously can’t fit it all in your view
of the storehouse.
So what it really is is representation of
the general inventory that commodities warehouse,
TDD, broker area would have and it actually
not dissimilar, in fact it is going to be
exactly the same system that runs the shops.
So, the shops themselves have an inventory,
obviously they’re probably going to have
a lot more guns or armour or weapons in the
back room then they do on the showroom floor.
What you see on the showroom floor even when
you go into a shop now is a representation
of what the inventory that shop is holding
and the same code that runs that is essentially
the code that would run the visual representation
of a storehouse.
In fact the commodity exchange and brokerage
is underneath it all, there’s no difference
between that really and a shop you might buy
weapons or armour or anything else.
It’s a place that can buy or sell items,
it has X number items and in the case of commodities
area the price of it can fluctuate based on
quantities.
Price may or may not fluctuate so much in
shops cause they tend to have smaller amounts.
You will be able to get a visible representation
in a lot of cases and that’s very much consistent
with our feeling of a kind of visceral ‘what
you see is what you get’ world, which is…
cause anything about Star Citizen we’re
very keen on that.
TZ: I would just add in that there are a few
practical limitations once you start talking
about ship shops and some of the larger weapons
and stuff.
Actually putting them into that area and still
giving you a significant selection becomes
problematic, so we may give you representative
samples of some of the smaller weapons and
the bigger ones are basically, pick the size
you want via the automated kiosk.
Insofar as having that visual element, that’s
actually something that you’ve always been
very consistent on and that permeates a whole
lot of what we’re doing over on the design
side.
Like one of the more recent examples would
be the shopping where some of the initial
design actually went more to a minimalistic
design where you basically selected…
more like a Grand Theft Auto thing where you’re
selecting from a list and one of the things
you specifically wanted was to actually be…
it’s that’s tangible aspect of being able
to touch, see the white t-shirt, the red t-shirt,
the shoes that look like this and not just
selecting it from a list of things.
So, we’re basically trying to implement
that concept throughout the entire interface
for the game.
CR: Yep, that’ll be good.
As much as I like Amazon, it’s still nice
to go into a store and look at things in person.
[7:26] Steve Apollyon asks: Are there any
plans on cargo loading of the bigger ships
such as the Hull series of ships and is the
loading at a space station or even planetary
going to be automatic or will we have a specialized
small cargo loading ships similar to the Argo
to load manually if we choose to.
TZ: Yeah, so we have talked about the fact
that we don’t want the larger ships to just
park it, click the button and it’s done.
That these larger ships that have vast quantities
of materials would actually take a significant
period of time to unload.
And they result in missions for NPCs and/or
other players to undertake.
We’ve got a pretty comprehensive design
right now but we’re still iterating through
that because we want to unify some of the
functionality for loading and unloading so
that it’s the same basic concept on the
smaller ships as on the larger ships.
And right now what we’ve got in the design
stage is something that works, I think, remarkably
well on the smaller stage it just doesn’t
scale so well when you start talking about
several orders of magnitude more materials
and how you don’t bottleneck in terms of
getting potentially dozens or hundreds of
other smaller ships to extract those resources.
So we’re still refining exactly how that’s
going to work but that’s the general direction.
So there is going to be commonality in terms
of you’ll have the ability to work at a
very localised scale and then you’ll be
able to scale that very wide so that there’s
content for a large number of players and/or
NPCs on these bigger ships.
CR: So, yeah, but are you answering whether
it’s automatic or not?
So like the way I was viewing it is that - and
I think that we maybe have this as a later
question in the series - when you go ... like
on a big space station … like if I have
a big container ship and a pull into the port
of LA here a Long Beach there’s a whole
set up: there’s longshoremen, big cranes
and there’s services.
And the crew of the container ship don’t
actually unload the containers themselves
- there’s equipment that does it and there’s
people that are paid to do that.
And I would say that in general in the bigger
space ports you would have that same kind
of setup where you would have the ability
to unload the bigger ships, unload the containers.
Potentially we’ve talked about having the
ability for players to play the part of a
longshoreman …
TZ: Right.
CR … they’re running around in a little
Argo and taking off a container from a Hull
E and dropping it to another place and doing
that.
Or having AI do that.
And then there obviously will be cases where
- which is probably a later question we have
here - there’ll be manual loading and unloading
of cargo where you don’t have the big services.
Like if I just had a ship and I was off the
coast somewhere and there wasn’t a port
then obviously …
TZ: Right.
CR: … I would have to be doing that myself.
And so I think we’ve been looking at way
that you have the automatic option that the
services provide for you …
TZ: The automatic option when appropriate
but the fidelity so that on these smaller
ships you can actually … and this makes
for much more interesting gameplay a of times
in a lot of different cases because you can
imagine scenarios to where you need to deliver
a smaller quantity - a half dozen, a dozen
- specific crates of some sort of illegal
liquor or something to somebody in a planet,
and part of the mission is not just finding
where to procure this stuff and then get through
customs without being detected, but once you
are actually on the planet now you’ve got
to take these crates physically to that guy
before he’s going to give payment.
And so all of a sudden you start to get into
a much more localised problem where you’re
trying to avoid security guards or else you’re
going at night because you may be …
CR: I think we have that … I think we have
a question that basically asks the same thing
a little later on but …
TZ: You threw everything off because you reversed
everything ...
CR: … well … yeah … I kind of … I
went from the big and the services to break
it down to the other one.
Okay so I think … so the answer is there’ll
be services but we’ll also have some specialised
ships and equipment for unloading cargo.
Especially in the case of the big Hull series.
[11:51] End-yo asks: Can you talk at all about
what is in store for the Salvage profession?
Will it involve carving up ships for scrap
(or resources in the repair profession), specifically
seeking out functioning or expensive parts
of derelict ships, or some combination of
those?
Will this be like mining and require good
scanning to effectively find salvageable ships
and stations?
TZ: Yeah mentally I break salvage into two
different concepts.
One is what I call scavenging when you’re
actually extracting entire pieces of value
from other ships, could be engines, could
be weapons, could be cargo whatever.
Then there’s also what I’d call scrapping
which is basically the extraction of the raw
materials.
You’re actually pulling off the metal plating
from the wings and stuff like that.
We’ve talked about having these elements
distributed in a logic fashion so that the
players that are more knowledgeable about
where the most valuable elements and stuff
are on a particular ship can strip the most
valuable pieces that much more quickly.
So what you’re going to wind up having is
a tier of players: some of interested in one
thing or the other, some of them are interested
in only the most valuable parts and then they
quickly move on looking for other things to
scrap.
Other players are basically looking at completely
reducing a ship down just a husk and leaving
no value behind.
CR: Yeah to be more specific to answer the
question.
It is going to be a combination of both so
you’ll be able to just take general sort
of debris and essentially scrap it into whatever
salvageable material that you will be able
to use or resell.
Then you can also look to salvage working
individual items.
So if a wing blows off, but maybe it has a
functioning gun that hasn’t been damage
or damaged very much, if you can find that
and detach that from the wing than you’ve
got a second hand item you can sell.
Both those are going to be part of the salvage
profession and Tony was talking about the
next level which is scanning and knowing the
aspects of a ship that may be the best to
salvage.
So you don’t want to maybe salvage the entire
hull, but perhaps this part of the hull has
whatever titanium armour and therefore is
more valuable than another part of the hull
so that will be the part that you want to
salvage or dissolve into your big salvage
tank.,
TZ: And one of things I really like about
that particular concept is that it scales
really well to any number of players.
In other words when you think about a salvage
ship as having one laser or whatever it is
that is basically going to pull the materials
off of there, you’ve only got a single player
that can actually engage in that and if you
want more maybe we could add a second one
of these devices, but you’re still going
to be fairly limited.
If you start to turn this into something to
where players with their individual hand controlled
stuff, it can basically extract things then
you have two things: one it becomes very time
consuming at that level, at a personal level
to scrap an entire ship, but it’s actually
still very cost effective if you have done
this enough as such that you know where all
the most valuable areas are and that’s all
you’re going to bother so.
So what I would say is when you're talking
about scrapping the entirety of a ship, that’s
probably going to be you’re going to aim
the fire house at it, the big dedicated device,
but when you’re talking about just extracting
bits of value you quickly get in get out maybe
because there’s a lot of residual dangers
in that area, then it actually becomes very
effective to have you and four, six guys who's
maybe other players, friends of y ours, other
NPCs that you’ve hired to just attack it
in mass, just hit the valuable parts and then
go on.
CR: Yup, absolutely.
So there you go.
All those things will be there so I think
salvaging will be quite and graphically kind
of already handle it with the damage shader
because you can sort of dissolve off the surface
in a more regular pattern and you’re taking
off the top of the hull for salvage.
TZ: This is a great example where we’re
reusing technology from one purpose to another
and we’re actually going to do the same
thing, repair is actually going to be largely…
CR: The other way.
TZ: the inverse of this process to where you
take all the raw materials that you’ve stored
in your ship and you can dispatch three, or
four, or six guys or the big dedicated device
depending upon how quickly you want to move
across the entire ship and repair just select
areas.
CR: Yup, alright so the 7th most popular question
comes from...
[16:28] Cyrocommander asks: In both cargo
running and mining, what types of hazards
can we expect?
Understandably, there will be the threat of
pirates, but what other dangers will we run
into, i.e., hitting a combustible methane
vent will mining, or the consequences of a
container malfunction during transport?
TZ: This is actually one of my favourite ones
because I like the concept of exploration,
discovery and just as I’m flying, going
about my business, doing one thing maybe mining
or whatever.
I’m encountered other stuff and so in terms
of the things other than pirates that might
kick you out quantum travel for a period of
time, this would include everything from meteor
showers, comets, derelict ships that cross
your path, debris fields, micro black holes,
just a variety of things like that.
The most interesting aspect about this I think
is that all these things that you encounter
can not only have potential value to you even
though you’re currently engaged in something
else because this represents information,
if you cross paths with a comet and that comet’s
not known to anyone else you can actually
sell that information that may be very valuable
to somebody who actually wants to mine it.
You start thinking about debris fields and
derelict spaceships and those are very valuable
to these guys that want engage in salvaging
operations and micro black holes are very
interesting to scientists that actually want
to be able to study these things to extract
value from them.
So, you can see this whole circular ecosystem
to where as you’re going about your business
you’re encountering both directly and indirectly
that can feed other parts of the economy.
The other thing that I really, really like
about this particular aspect is just the variety
that it’s going to bring when you start
getting all these players interacting in all
these different ways.
CR: Yeah, I had else to say that the other
things, well obviously we talked about mining
potentially hitting a gas vent that can cause
an explosion and those sort of things.
Cargo and in general just transit we…
besides things you can encounter, we very
much have this high fidelity of simulation
of various components of your ship and part
of the big pink unicorn of Item 2.0 is the
fact that we have age and wear and things
will break down.
So, that’s not currently in the game as
you guys are playing it but it’s very much
part of the systems that will be part when
the full Item 2.0 comes online.
Which means that under stress, being used
a lot say in a long quantum drive like when
you’re on a trading cargo run or something,
the items… you’re powerplant, your engine,
your thrusters, lights, whatever, they have
aged, they can fail, they can misfire.
So, there will definitely be a certain amount
of maintenance keeping your ship running especially
in the bigger ships.
If you’ve watched any science fiction movie
and you’ve seen Chewie banging the Millenium
Falcon or the crew of the Nostromo having
to keep their ship running and stuff like
that.
That is going to be a gameplay component besides
just things that… you know, pirates you
can run across and everything like that.
We mentioned that with the real vast scale
that we have in the game, we’re not sort
of compressing the star systems the way a
lot of other space games have.
I mean we are compressing it because if we
went full real scale then it would take way,
way longer for people to travel across one
solar system than I think people would enjoy
but we are still having a massive amount of
scale.
Much more so than other games will have and
therefore when you’re in quantum drive at
0.2 speed of light, which is very fast you
theoretically could spend half an hour to
go from one side of the star system to another
side of the star system.
Now likelihood is you’ll never be in quantum
drive for that long because you’ll be pulled
out for some reason or there’ll be something
in the way but you could quite easily be in
quantum drive for a few minutes, 5 minutes
or whatever, 10 minutes and part of we don’t
want you to be bored so you’re running around.
There will be things for you to do to keep
your ship running while you’re doing that,
so it’s sort of like travel gameplay and
that will be one of the parts of being a long
distance explorer or cargo hauler where you’ll
actually have things to do like you would
if you were a sea captain on a container ship
crossing the Atlantic ocean or the Pacific.
TZ: You mentioned boredom and that kind of
goes back to that sense of discovery I was
talking about.
We don’t want these things that pull you
out of quantum travel to always be viewed,
if you’re currently doing something else,
as an annoyance.
We actually want make these things indirectly
entice players to occasionally break off what
they’re doing and explore a little bit more.
There’s a variety of ways by which we can
do that if you think about I’m currently
mining and I’ve basically loaded up my ship
with ore and I’m heading over the refinery
and all of the sudden you’re kicked out
of quantum travel, and you got a ping on your
radar and all you know is at this distance
is that it’s a ship and at conventional
cruise speeds it’s three minutes away.
Do you now start spooling up your quantum
engines after you’ve course corrected to
get around it and you’re going to go ahead
and jump out but the information that there’s
a derelict ship there when you don’t know
anything about it, its current state, whether
it’s already been salvaged, what type of
ship it is… that information is worth much
less.
Or do you go off the beaten path and now you’re
actually going to invest three minutes to
go… you were mining but it seems safe, so
I’m going to head over and I’m going to
get a little bit closer.
Now I know what type of ship it is, I’m
going to go a little bit closer still, now
I can actually see it hasn’t actually been
scrapped.
There’s a lot of value here, this key that
I have is now very extraordinarily valuable
when I go to sell that information to someone
else but I got a little bit too close and
it turns out there’s already some other
people.
You know pirates that have pulled up or scrappers
and they don’t want anyone else to have
this information so they’re moving to basically
take you out so can’t alert other players
and bring them there.
All of the sudden you wanted to extract a
little bit value about something you incidentally
ran into and you ventured a little bit too
closer and now you’ve basically walked into…
not something that was intentionally meant
as a trap but it works out that way none the
less.
CR: Yup, when a lot of this stuff is working
we have a much bigger play field which is
in the offing, that’s what we’re working
on right now.
I think the gameplay possibilities and fun
going to be much better…
well, I mean much better than it is now.
I think it’ll be something really special
so that’s going to be cool, so let’s carry
on.
[23:41] Poison Taco asks: With 2.6 and 2.6.1
Star Marine has started to introduce destructible
props in the game.
Shattering glass, explosive barrels and etc.
The most recent monthly report mentioned that
the team was looking to add more oprs and
items that can be destroyed in the game.
Presumably this work will carry into the Persistence
Universe.
Have you put any thought into how destroyed
props will be restored in the Persistence
Universe?
Example being, if a player could shatter the
glass windows in Port Olisar, how would the
game “reset” to a point where windows
are replaced?
CR: So this is something that we’re focusing
on long term.
So it’s part of what we’ve talked about,
persistence, we have a very basic version
of persistence that we rolled out last year,
but we don’t have full persistence as in
the full persistences persisting state of
you as a character, your ship, other items,
other locations around the world and persisting
state is important for like whether things
are damaged or whether there’s a window
broken or something like that.
That is actually part of the roadmap that
we have this year that we’re working on
is bringing in persistence more and more persistence
as we go so we’ll be able to persist state
pretty much most things as well as where they
are, what their location.
So if you go down on a moon and you drop an
item or leave a ship there and leave that
area which means it’s going to out of memory
on your computer and then you come back to
it, depending on the importance of the item,
we want persist it which means it will be
persisted to the online database that we keep
all, you know it’s basically this online
cloud save game for the entire universe and
your ship should be there.
Now obviously if you drop a gum wrapper and
you leave the area, we don’t want to clog
up the game with millions of gum wrapper items.
So small items that don’t mean much like
bullet shells or whatever would just be discarded
if you left the area, but certain items, especially
items that you would own like a spaceship
or something will persist and stay around
and that’s what we call the entity owner
manager.
So there’s basically a manager that would
manage what’s in your ship, like in the
cargo hold or what you’re owning or what’s
inside the space station or what’s on an
area in a planet and then that’s what responsible
for managing the persistence of these items
and whether they stay or not and then also
is serial and then the items themselves are
saving off their stay and so what that means
is for something like Port Olisar if we wanted
to allow you to break or destroy common areas
which is another discussion because you know,
we don’t want someone blowing out a window
in an area where everyone else is and killing
all the people hanging out in the space station.
So there will definitely be some areas where
we will not allow you to have player generated
mayhem, but there certainly could be the cases.
You know you already see in the Comm-Satellite
missions where you’re asked to go and turn
them back on or not, well we’re definitely
going to have stuff where there’ll be a
space station or a satellite relay that's
been damaged or broken by an AI or maybe even
by a player and that will automatically generate
a mission inside our system to say, “Hey
come and repair me” and players or AI could
respond to it and they would go there and
repair it and then its persistence state would
go from damaged to functional again.
TZ: That’s how
CR: If it’s broken then the cycle starts
again.
TZ: That’s how I read the question which
is basically we’ll have two different tiers
of repairs I would say and one of them is
significant enough as such that it warrants
the creation of missions and this would be
damaged satellites and things of that sort
and if a player doesn’t do it then a NPC
will.
Then there’s also just the more stuff, I
would say it’s more cosmetic.
Windows getting shot out in Area 18 and there’s
always going to be players there and so it
won’t be so much an issue of well when the
players all go away then we can just go ahead
and reset things.
That will be handled more by just the NPC
community.
There will be NPCs that actually do savage,
not salvage, that basically do maintenance.
Maintaining of a given area and when you break
glass, when you basically shoot barrels of
trash and garbage gets scattered about, some
of the NPCs would have the responsibility
of fixing that up, cleaning things up, etc.
CR: Cleaning up after the players.
TZ: which makes for that much more an interesting
world because not only can you break things
in interesting fashion, you can actually see
the NPC community put it back to together.
CR: You’re going off to prison because you’re
a vandal.
Not a Vanduul, a vandal.
[28:34] Lethality asks: Regarding cargo hauling,
can you clarify how the loading and unload
of ships will work at both the initial; launch
of cargo system, and what the long-term vision
of the cargo system will be?
There has been some confusion regarding manual
loading/unloading with all the cool logistics
that presents (not to mention all of the maglev
containers and hand jacks!)
CR: So I’m thinking Lethality wants to physically
load and unload and this is sort of an extension
or along the lines of what we’re been talking
about with the bigger Hull C class a little
earlier on in 10 for the Chairman here.
So as we were saying, we are going to have
both.
So there is going to be physically loading
and unloading and they’ll also be, whether
you want to call it automated or AI unloading/loading
in sort of bigger space ports or bigger landing
areas because that’s generally what would
happen in those cases, but there’s definitely
going to be gameplay that would involve you
say flying out supplies to a remote outpost
and there is no people there to help load
or unload and you have to unload it.
Or you come across some stuff you want to
get that’s floating in space, you have to
load that in manually and do all the rest.
So there’s going to be both loading and
unloading physically which we already have
shown a small amount of like you looked at
the Gamescom demo that we did of going to
the moon after visiting Levski and Delmar
and there were some crates, little containers
and we picked it up and were taking it to
the Freelancer we were flying at the time.
That is an example of the more granular physical
loading and unloading.
There will be equipment that will allow you
to move bigger containers around.
So we have some standard size, larger cargo
containers and that will have sort of a grav
lev jack stuff and potentially there will
be other, whether we create some vehicles
or things like the Argo to move smaller stuff
around and then load it up onto bigger stuff.
So I think we’re going to have both, I don’t
know if you want to elaborate on it because
I know you already talked a bit about it.
TZ: Yeah that’s basically it.
To me personally, lik the most interesting
stuff is actually when you’re dealing with
smaller quantities that you actually have
to hand load because it just makes for more
interesting mission scenarios when you don’t
want to just deliver it to the shop.
Now I actually have to basically travel through
space with this material that I procured,
land and then I have to do that last leg and
now i’m on foot and it’s just a completely
different type of experience, different types
of challenges we can throw at a player.
CR: What I would say that like, smuggling
would be a case that you’re not going to
have a…
TZ: A supertanker full of fuel becomes hard
to justify smuggling.
CR: Yeah, well… and there’s going to be
all sizes of you know, there can be items
that you can hold in your hand that you would
potentially smuggle or carry it like diamonds
or something, could be gems could be an example
of that to a really massive containers that
are just full of ore or liquids or whatever.
So there’s all kinds of it so there is,
besides big bulk cargo because you have bulk
cargo stuff and more bespoke like if I was
collecting I don’t know, sort of rare space
truffles.
So space truffles don’t come in massive
ton container things, they would be small
containers, but they would be worth a lot
of money so that would be something you would
probably take personally around and of course
you have smaller things like I was mentioning
gems or perhaps contraband or you’re smuggling
drugs or things that you shouldn’t smuggle
and those particular ones you would have to
put away in a hidden compartment, that was
shielded, hope you don’t get scanned or
boarded by the Advocacy and then when you
get on the planet you’re going to have to
Han Solo style sneak it off your ship.
That’s the beauty of having it all based
on essentially a kind of character level,
first person level because it’s not just
about the ship, it’s about also there’s
extra mechanics once you’ve landed and how
do I get past the guards with this stuff and
so I think that’s going to add a whole bunch
of like, fun gameplay for people.
TZ: Yeah to me, I’ve said before I tend
to get bored fairly easily if I’m not constantly
presented with different types of challenges
and so I like the ability to take the high
level concept of cargo transport and basically
extend it as such that it doesn’t just involve
ships, but you’ve actually got, whether
you’re getting the stuff back to your ship
and then do the space travel etc, or if you’ve
landed with your ship and you need to actually
get it to the guy in the back alley without
security seeing you or whatever the case may
be or you’re carrying something really valuable
and now since you’re actually holding it,
you’re at a disadvantage because it takes
you a couple seconds longer to actually drop
that, pull your weapon so you’re actually
more vulnerable when you’re running through
the CD tunnels of Levski or something like
that.
So all of a sudden you can see players starting
to do this mental calculus and thinking, “Well
am I going to go on my own?
Do I basically try to recruit a few friends,
do I hire an NPC body guard as I’m doing
this?”
It’s all that variety that to me, really
makes it interesting.
CR: Yeah, well..
TZ: Every player is going to go about it in
a little bit different fashion.
CR: Yeah, I mean..
Because obviously I read what people write
out on our forums and elsewhere, but there’s
a lot, like people go, “I want to know more
about game mechanics”, but in reality there’s
a huge amount of, essentially what people
would normally consider game mechanics or
gameplay that comes out us building these
core systems and we’ve really been pushing
and it’s been taking longer than obviously
we were thinking it was going to take and
partly it’s because we’re building it
to work at a scale and across a huge universe
and with millions of players, but our belief
is that if we build these systems that are
super flexible.
So like we talked about item 2.0 and I think
in the last studio update from L.A. we showed
a little prototype of the interaction and
if you take a look at the interaction, that’s
not an interaction system that you see in
any FPS game.
It’s like you can pick things up and use
them and plug them into something else and
put a battery into something to turn it on
or open up compartments and take.
So you have this ability to manipulate items
and use them and they have the ability to
do what you would normally expect like a battery
provides power and if this radio needed power,
then you put it in and now suddenly the radio
can work and maybe that will help you achieve
something else.
So we’re basically building this system
and a good example of it is like when we’re
talking about the smuggling because all the
stuff we’re talking about in general falls
out of the system of being able to physically
own and manipulate, put stuff in areas and
all the rest of the stuff so you know all
we really have to do on top of that is just
determine that these items are illegal and
the AI logic for the law enforcement, the
advocacy, whoever is that if they catch you
with it, you’re in trouble, but in general
the manipulation, the hiding of it and all
the rest, that all falls out of the scanning
stuff that we’ve been working on, the item
manipulation stuff that we’ve been working
on.
So a lot of our professions we’ve talked
at the base level of what we want to have
for 3.0 kind of fall out of these core mechanics
that we worked really, really hard on, but
I think once they’re done it’s just going
to provide a platform quite a ways beyond
what you can currently do in 2.6.1.
And that’s when I get excited.
TZ: Yeah we’ve talked about this a number
of times before to where basically you build
the system and you get it setup properly,
then it requires very little tweaking to affect
a lot of gameplay, a lot of interesting gameplay
potential and this is basically the route
we’ve gone since the very beginning.
We didn’t want to go the route of having
to custom code each one of these things and
then yes the addition of new content becomes
an enormously difficult task, and then you
see this in a lot of other games to where
the amount of content, the amount of new content
that you can release always lags behind what
the players can actually experience.
They usually go out, they experience the new
content and then they run in circles for the
next 12 months until the next big update happens
and in this case we wanted to eventually get
to the point where we can put in place what
I’d call a functional world and then basically
we just give you entry points into that and
everything else more or less falls out of
that.
CR: We’re getting close.
I think people will appreciate it when it’s
there.
[37:46] Cap asks: Will we be able to move
between professions fluidly, or will we have
to re-qualify for a profession if we decide
to switch to something else?
CR: So, that’s a pretty simple one to answer
is absolutely you can move between professions
fluidly.
We don’t want to gate you as a player, we
don’t have prerolled skills for you.
This kinda comes down to the system versus
different mechanics like an RPG game you would
design different mechanics or sets for like,
‘oh here’s my smuggling role set, here’s
my cargo role set, here’s my mercenary role
set’ and it would have all these separate
things.
You would be sort of I’m either this or
I’m that whereas with us you’re not, we
just basically figure we try to simulate an
open world.
Obviously we’re not simulating it to a level
that real life is but we’re trying to approximate
it and then we let you pick what you want
so really your ability to perform different
professions whether you want to haul cargo
or whether you want to be a mercenary is more
down to the equipment you have.
Then also there will be some level of access
for missions like for instance, no one’s
going to trust you to take a whole bunch of
valuable cargo until you’ve done enough
missions that have proven yourself as a reliable
cargo hauler.
TZ: That’s the key point to me, that’s
the key point to me which is there are no
technical limitations in terms of you doing
this but we still want to have just like in
the real world, we want to give players the
ability to progress.
By that I mean that there will usually be
entryway points where you can kind of do the
junior mining missions, you can do the junior
security missions, whatever it is.
Then you will build up a personal reputation
that’s global, everybody knows how good
you are in general at this particular profession
versus that one, etc.
That opens the door to additional missions
and then there’s another layer beyond that
which is you can be an incredibly well known
criminal but that doesn’t mean the mafia
boss here personally trusts you.
So you get into the personal relationships
to where, well I basically worked my way up
and I’ve become…
CR: I think we’re answering the second most
popular question.
TZ: Ok then.
CR: So, yes you’ll be able to move fluidly
between professions.
[40:07] Kenzi Snow asks: With the recent progress
update on the Prospector, is it safe to assume
that we will have ship based mining to some
degree with the launch of 3.0?
CR: So the quick answer is yes it is something
that we’re absolutely trying to achieve.
So we think we’ll be able to do some version
of basic mining by 3.0, may not be the final
more sophisticated…
TZ: Yeah, I would say we’re shuffling...
the full set we’re looking at what we can
trade off, what would be more interesting
to the player community, what naturally falls
out given the development trajectory.
What we can pull in a bit more easily than
what we originally though and you know at
the same time what’s basically a little
more difficult so we’re shuffling some of
the 3.1, 3.0, 3.2 things around.
CR: Maybe move some stuff around cause when
we first talked about 3.0 sort of last half
of last year, we originally had in mind a
simpler set of functionality and features
that we were going to do.
Once we sat down and said, well if we’re
doing this we kind of need to do this, we
kind of need to do this and it ended up being
a lot more stuff to really deliver.
Basically it was like anyone else’s ship
in game, functionality and I think I said
it before but we started with like… so what
we put up on the cards was this much and now
we got confluence pages of like this much
at least four or five times as many of the
systems and features than we were originally
thinking.
So what’s happened is that obviously means
3.0 is taking a bit longer than we were thinking.
It also means that certain things like when
ships are available and some of the professions
we thought we could get to, we may move things
around because some of the stuff… mining’s
an example of this, some of the stuff will
have equipment like ships, whether it be salvage
or mining or whatever before.
So, mining is definitely one that is on our
radar and would like do it because it’s
kind of a basic…
it’s a resource collection profession and
could really feed into the ecosystem.
TZ: We’re looking to trade that one for
some other stuff, I think that there’s a
lot of players that would very much appreciate
that type of game play versus some of the
other stuff that we talked about being in
3.0.
I think that it would actually give us a much
more well rounded set of professions…
initial professions.
I would also point out that you mentioned
how we’re thinking about it in a little
bit more…
little bit larger terms in terms of the sum
total of functionality that you’ll be able
to engage in.
The initial tier of stuff is actually…
there’s an entire tier of functionality
that we think we can actually get to and like
you said it’s not the entire mining experience
but it’s still going to give players a whole
lot of interesting gameplay.
CR: Yeah, definitely.
[43:22] Dr_Murray asks: To effectively perform
a job, will we need to qualify for them beforehand,
like earning a certain amount of rep, or will
it be as easy to get started as having the
right kind of ship?
CR: We were kinda discussing this on the previous
question about moving professional between
professions fluidly.
So, to do a job like if I just wanted to cargo
haul, if I’ve got a ship that can take cargo
I’ll be able to get basic cargo missions.
If you want to get more interesting or more
lucrative ones then you’ll have to build
your rep up whether it’s going to be with
a merchant’s guild or someone that’s a
cargo broker or something like that.
Much like the mission giver that we sort of
showed at GamesCom last year, we’ll have
characters out there that will be giving you
sort of higher grade missions that pay better,
that are maybe a bit more interesting, a bit
more challenging.
So you sort of have to kind of prove your
mettle and then you get a certain rep as you
were saying and you can move onto the more
interesting missions.
If you just want to haul cargo and you’ve
got a Freelancer, yeah you absolutely be able
to start doing that and then it’s up to
you how far you want to go in that profession.
TZ: So, there’s a lot of the smaller ships
to where you could potentially fit a small
number of crates, 4,6,8, 20 crates.
The amount of cargo you can haul is obviously
going to affect what type of thing you might
be looking to transport, in other words…
I mentioned earlier, illegal liquors and stuff
which you know a dozen crates of that could
actually have a pretty hefty profit margins.
When you’re talking about hauling commodities,
probably not so much.
You’re usually talking about… unless you’re
talking about some of the more valuable ones,
you’re usually talking about greater quantities,
you need a larger ships…
those ships in general tend to move slower
therefore you may want a security escort and
on and on and on.
CR: Ok.
[45:24] Daryell asks: Will there be an autopilot
in ships traveling from Point A to Z that
will allow me to get up and move around?
CR: The answer is yes, we’re already talking
if you’re in quantum drive you’ll eventually
have to move around your ship to fix whatever,
a fuel rod that goes bad or there’s a leak
somewhere or a fuse breaks.
So, we were talking about this before, we
were discussing you pry should be able to
set an autopilot like singular point distance.
So not just for quantum drive but maybe even
just traveling in normal like SCM or cruise
speeds and then you can sort of leave the
helm and walk around.
Then of course if your ship is going to hit
something whether it's in quantum drive or
regular space mode, it would pull you out,
it would basically stop sort of like one of
those auto sensing brake systems.
TZ: This kinda segues into the whole crew
functionalities where not only can you go
off and do something but you actually have
a navigator, you can turn over control of
the ship to him and basically give him some
basic high level commands.
In other words, I’m in convention travel
I say go over there, it’s five minutes of
flight, I’m going to check on my cargo or
I’m going to affect repairs in engineering
because I just took some damage and I can
give him some basic instructions.
What do you do if we come under fire?
Do you stop, do you basically try to quickly
escape, do you take evasive maneuvers.
This kind of goes back to what we were talking
about on one of the previous segments to where
you'll be able to control your crew but at
a very high, very macro level.
We’re not going to turn it into this micromanagement
game, but if you’ve actually made the investment,
you’ve got another pilot, you’ve actually
paid for somebody who’s got a significant
level of experience…
then you’re all the way back in engineering,
it’s going to take you 60 seconds to get
to the bridge, he needs to do something to
not make you a sitting duck for the pirates
you just ran across.
CR: So the bottom line is, if it’s just
you solo, you do the autopilot.
It’s simple point A to point B, will stop
you so you don’t hit anything but if you
have crew and you have some… tell him to
take the helm and you go to the back to fix
the engine, that crew can operate at a higher
level like they can stop but evade fire or
try to escape the area or do something while
you’re heading back to take the helm.
TZ: Which is interesting too cause that doesn’t
really involve any new coding on our side
because we already got NPCs that know how
to pilot spacecraft.
So all we’re really doing is giving you
an interface to this technology that we’ve
already set up for other things.
Outro
CR: Alright there you go.
That is the 10 most voted questions on Spectrum
by subscribers for 10 for the Chairman here.
So it’s been kind of fun answering the questions
here and haven’t been getting to do this
that much recently because I’ve been doing
a lot of travel between all the different
studios, but we’re going to try have 10
for the Chairman, it will definitely be happening,
but maybe some of the other disciplines we
have and we’ll be using the features of
Spectrum which are not only going to get better
to allow you guys to really ask the ones that
you care about and not rely on us to pick
the best ones.
It’s much better for you to tell us which
ones you really want.
So I think on the 10 for the Chairman side
of it we’re going to try to do it at least
once a quarter, maybe a bit more.
We’ll see what happens on my travel scheduling
and everything, but we’d like to be providing
this kind of feedback with you on questions
for the game, we’ve got the Subscriber Town
Halls and things like that.
So thank you all for supporting us to be able
to shoot this extra stuff and we’re thankful
for you guys out there and girls that have
backed the game to allow us to make it and
with that I would say, goodnight.
What are you going to say Tony?
TZ: Just thanks again for all your support.
Without you guys none of this would be possible.
CR: Alright, bye guys.
