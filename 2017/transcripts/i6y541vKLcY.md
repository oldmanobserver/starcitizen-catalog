## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm sandy
Gardner and I'm Chris Rose on today's
show we examine our expensive usable
system and look at what it takes for a
player to pick up put down and even sit
in an object in game as well as whether
we break the record for most mess hall
animations in one episode oh we probably
will but first let's check in with the
team for the latest bugs and block is
affecting three point zero in this
week's burn down welcome back to burn
down our weekly show dedicated to
reviewing progress on issues blocking
the release of star citizen alpha 3.0
last week we ended at seven total must
fix issues which were prioritized as
three blockers two criticals one high
and one moderate so let's check in on
progress this week
so yeah what I'll do is pass this list
of Gira's over to this list of bugs over
to QA we'll gather up the bugs for them
and put any new ones in pretty much all
my notes for this are gonna be just the
list of here the bugs that we've
highlighted in our playthrough and I'll
call out the ones that look like they're
gonna need to be a PT must fix and and
then call out Aaron to make a decision
on like on which ones of those if he
agrees with them all or which ones he
doesn't this morning the doors and the
easy hub doors and grim heads don't open
it's been assigned over to Matthias it
could be a DBA animation issue the rest
of them are all for the most part or
back and related earlier today though we
had a gameplay review with production
leads and directors the idea of that was
to go through what we want to do for
evocati you know get up out of your bed
in olisar get into a ship go round and
explore do various bits of traversal and
some quantum travel jumps do some
exploration we wanted to really make
sure that what we were looking for
with so many and new bugs that had
appeared that no one had bugs yet just
to make sure that we got absolutely
everything we really wanted to get fixed
for the evocati and i'm glad to say that
we actually only found three bugs all of
which we already knew we needed to fix
up for the other carry so that was
really good the important stuff is four
giant fixes stuff I don't think outside
of that any of those blockers for going
to okati
so we'll just see once we get one get
the persistence I've fixed up and I
think we could probably go with what
else we'll picked up I did see an issue
when I plan today and I'm not sure it's
just the cutlasses all ships that the UI
is is completely blurry and and the
colors on least on the UI are just
absolutely insane so I just want to make
sure that that's that's just a Cutlass
issue and not all ship why don't one
thing from the engineer
discussing the object container sort of
opening up an editing Institute
especially for lighting so you know
Ariel's been doing some work
Steve Humphries is kind of starting to
get work but I think there's a
disconnect between engineering stuff
which we have some taxa people just be
working on by themselves versus what the
users need and what so we were talking
about trying to put a little bit of
focus on that because I think the
problem is that like there's things
they've done but like listening is know
about right and then maybe some of the
things work but in the way it would be
good for the artists anyway so what we
hear is someone that can drag a bit of
that process that can straddle between
the technical side and the artistic side
I volunteered you in engineering yeah
that sounds good and again sort of like
we talked about in the project
directories Derek and I have to think
that because ultimately all the tools
programmers render Derek very well not
all of them but two of the four
basically would be it would be but what
happen is like it's you know finding out
like walk you know like what would make
it easier for you or Chris Campbell
today panas or whatever and making sure
that like we're doing the things because
we have these tacks I mean arrows be
working on the cross object container
editing he's got QT windows just to
bring up and stuff but yeah I think a
lot of the on the content side people
aren't even aware like I think it was
only today and I think there's some
issues opening it up but they want to
fix it but so what I'd like to do is
sort of have someone's driving that
process I think is the global content
that's kind of your job to extrapolate
this should translate for engineering
what they need to be for the tools and
stuff making sure you're listening to
all the needs of the content traders
because I think we've had a bit of
disconnect it's like we need these
things and so cheers get paid and then
people sort of work on the chair know
what's worse have attractive it doesn't
have a cohesive like beat up like oh
that right
being slow-mo I think we're in slow-mo
so this is the book the Clyde's working
on right now and this will eventually
catch up this is like the first time you
guys have seen this in a few days right
and we have been seen it's just fairly
infrequently now yeah yeah typical
typical happens on the I've been much to
get a low repro book for starmap
yesterday so only as far as we know so
the clock was actually running very
slowly on the client and the effect if
you look at this video here as you can
see players starts moving he's moving
very slowly he does eventually recover
so and we have these four times that
we've got from the ping and pong
messages we enter two sample points on a
linear regression and that's allows us
to estimate this straight line and
offset and slope and the reps and drift
between two clocks and the offset
between them and you don't account for
latency we don't account for lateness
see in these samples what we rely on is
the mathematical technique using to
balance it out and the reason that we do
that is because latency isn't
symmetrical so the time it takes for a
message to go from client to a server is
very rarely the time equal to the time
it takes for the message to go from the
server back to the client so that can
skew our time compensation algorithms a
bit so we use several samples an average
house users and say least squares method
to try and balance it out so the bug was
actually the one on the samples the
first sample was getting rejected
but then the second sample would being
so you'd have an unbalanced error it was
very large and throw the whole
calculation off take time for an the
client to recover then so the fix was to
make sure that we only ever enter the
samples in pairs and if we're going to
clear out the history because it's got
to diverge from the new input through
again then we only we clear out the
whole thing up two pairs and we don't
ever have a stray one left in we did a
desk review with Aaron and and he
basically sat with us played through the
game and just called out issues that he
fought with a big big things that would
stop was going to evac ie there's only a
couple of issues of that and then we got
together a list that would come under
the things that he pointed out we send
the email to production and got the mas
fix labels stuck on all of those issues
just so they've got more eyes on a full
production right now I'm testing a bug
that was the gamescom bug the big one
that caused the crash on stage so the
reason the bug was happening on stage is
that we weren't free in the tope the
tokens for each of the seats that a
player may take these are like tokens
that allow a play to get in to getting
to the copilot seat getting to the the
pilot seat maybe even exchange goods at
a shop or all the different different
things that players can do and we
weren't freeing all of the tokens when
it when clients would disconnect or
crash so the bug fix wants to insure
that on a client disconnect we picked up
the signal and ensured that all the
tokens that they were taking up at the
time were freed and then said that any
new clients that were either in the game
or connected later could then retake
their tokens and take the seats the last
two
[Music]
to the plane of the solar system when
you do a jump because turns up market
system and that changes several things
perfectly marked bugs now is the
stations around crusader near Portola
start the you can have to for some
reason you jumped on your way off i
think is obtaining issue because the
arrival radius is like and for something
then small he really should just travel
around closer we've currently got two
bugs left now before we go to evocati
yesterday we had the persistence issues
that were causing a lot of grief got
fixes him for those QA in austin got a
new build for that and tested them they
all seem to be fine so we were actually
looking on course to have gone to the
evocati group we had a book come in last
night from ATX as we were preparing to
push to evocati it was a server crash
that happened when ships were d spawning
our server it was picked up by one of
our network engineers in the UK who
ensured the cache tokens were removed
prior to an entity being shut down and
it means that the servers are now stable
as we prepared for another peak evocati
push
came in this morning we had an email
from our us studio in Austin that came
to as whilst everyone in the UK gone
home and this kind of outlined what the
underlying cause of a few other issues
we were seeing was the the main course
seemed to be that our build system for
for some reason hadn't been picking up
any changes in our persistent data cache
over the last couple of bills which is
seems to have been the the main reason
as to why we had a few issues like all
the sharp items not being present at all
in any of the shops and then also once
we'd run a build with the with the
persistence cache properly updated there
were a few crashes related to this
because in the previous time the interim
time had been some work that had gone on
with the persistence cache which then
had a bit of a knock-on effect of
causing some other crashes frustrating
experience and you're going to get a
whole bunch of people download it and
then if the frequency of crashes is
relative or proportional to the amount
of people playing there will be a lot
more you'll be having pressures every
minute to go because you're gonna fill
up these instances pretty quickly I
would guess every ever County would be
like this is the very first time they
get to play 3-0 so they'll be excited
don't download it then though we get
kicked out to the desktop
like what I can glean out of it right
now it is very strange
so it's gonna need some digging as to
why this particular sequence of events
has occurred we want this to be as clear
and as stable as possible is you testing
the environment it's going to be plated
meaning 3.0 is multiplier you test in
multiplayer you just connect it to a
server and then I guess just make sure
the UK QA for the gym and QA is
available - oh yeah so as you can see
we've started our official go/no-go sync
which is the place where key
stakeholders from each discipline
evaluate the build with Chris and ensure
we're all in agreeance that it's ready
for the publishing process these will be
held almost daily going forward this
week our issue count fluctuated up and
down based on build stability when we
hit 0 issues yesterday we held our first
go/no-go sync and we discovered a few
new issues we needed to fix prior to
this release we had another sync today
and even with our new fixes that build
remain unstable so at the time of
filming this we've reduced our must fix
issues from last week by 2 meaning we
have 5 issues blocking this first
release we're getting very excited by
the prospect of wider testing and cannot
wait to get this massive update to the
star citizen universe for you to play in
the very very near future see you back
next week here on burndown thanks Eric
if you're looking for more information
on what bugs move smash then be sure to
check out the production schedule report
on our website now let's turn our
attention to usable x' which basically
consists of any items that players at
AAA can't interact with in the game this
includes everything from picking up a
cup using a laptop to hack and control
point in summary or even sitting at a
table in the mess hall so there you go
devising a system that could make the
experience feel real and natural while
covering the vast amount and variety of
usable that would appear in the game was
a huge challenge the team had to tackle
yes so let's take a look
use of balls for us started in the lead
up to last year citizencon
we've kind of realized that you know we
have a lot of seats in the game and the
only type of seats available to us with
the pilot seats pile seats are
complicated you don't want to say like
oh it's a park bench or it's you know a
bench in the mess hall or a bed you
don't want to say like that has the same
attributes as a pilot's seat we wanted
to create something simplest we came up
this idea which is just oh it's just a
simple seat is super super lightweight
and easy to mass-produce so we started
with art then it kind of grew into to
also incorporate other things like the
first the first actual test case of this
simple seat which meant we had to change
the name really was there hacking laptop
in the star marine so that's there's no
seat involved at all so it became like
more like yeah I use about something to
use and when you use it it plays an
animated reaction on the player and it
might be multiple ways you can use it so
you have to hold in a fort on top of it
so you can select like oh I want to hack
the laptop I want to close the laptop
maybe saw and closed it now you need to
open it first you know all that kind of
complex behavior so in a game world it's
like talking to babies right when when I
tell you sit on a chair you know how to
sit on a chair because you've done that
a thousand times but what happens in the
game world is that the AI needs to
actually ask the chair how it is
supposed to use it so it's like the the
chair needs to hold the data of you can
sit from all those different angles you
can use those animation to do so when
you are actually sitting you can play
this this and and that stuff if you're
sitting and I'm attached to a table you
can pick up stuff that's on the table
but then again well when you are sitting
on the chair you
know that there's something on the table
and you just pick it up di has no
conscience of that so you need to tell
or tell Dai - basically you're on a
chair that's linked to a table and so
the table tells you I also have a glass
on me and yeah I then has to know that
it can pick it up but basically we're
gonna we're remapping all the way our
brain are hardwired for the AI
step-by-step so all that seems trivial
is actually something that we need to
take care of so it's like we're mapping
every conscious choice linked to walking
so you're putting your foot up putting
your foot forward putting your foot down
putting your other foot up and you
basically need to tell the AI to do all
of those stuff one by one instead of
just relying on its ability to just in
you know do what it's supposed to do
because there's no such concept so after
the failure we basically realized that
we needed the angle of the other
discipline in a more involved way and
then we have had up until now so coming
from the UK studio in the densest limb
against lins team what we were joined by
Jamie Visser he who is a gameplay
programmer we started working on the
improvement of the workflow and how the
animation and geometry of the usable
were processed in the pipeline and we
got a few updates in that were actually
speeding up the pipeline so much such as
all the alignment around the usable that
I talked about we actually read that
that from the animation so you don't
need all of this heavy clunky markup
which basically sped up the art process
so much and from Austin we were working
with Bryan Brewer which was helping us
from the start in the first installation
and kept doing so creating some kind of
triangle of people coming at this system
from all of their angle and trying to
covering all the bases and all the cases
that we needed so we were both able to
basically optimize the pipeline for
everyone because one of each discipline
was involved with citizencon there was
some request that we didn't see coming
such as older repair and maintenance in
action warden Idris for example meaning
you have to take components out of
certain parts of the ship inspect them
replace them carry them around and all
that was not ready the first time we
tried to do all that and so basically
what we realized is that the system has
to be request base and be able to kind
of cater to all of those new requests
that was they were coming in so we
created a whole process where people can
actually request usable we created a way
to basically categorized those requests
and you know identify where what were
stuff that we could already do and I
would go through the pipeline easily and
stuff that we actually had to build some
tech for and coming out of citizencon
there was a lot of stuff that we need to
take for so wants to start the the team
was actually created it was really
easily to pick from those and actually
just go in here okay let's let's lift
that locker
let's lift that locker let's lift that
locker and just go for it
so the first time you've you've seen a
usable list the hacking panel and then
we've kind of moved on me also converted
there medopad dispenser that's gonna be
a usable hopefully in the next release
so we're slowly kind of growing like the
players interaction with the usable and
then at the start of this year designers
wanted to use the usable x' for a eyes
as well so we started this whole new
sprint paradigm where we're working like
with design we're working with prop team
that were working with the animators
everyone together in in a task force
that's gonna grow this kind of AI actors
interacting with things in the world in
lots and lots of different ways so the
first case we had was the mess hall
table so we had a single big usable like
a long mess hall but with eight
different different actors could sit
potentially sit at the same time if you
choose to eat together like a family
they could all sit there at same time so
I was first we had to do we had to take
the usable
now was a entry point like a single
actor could use it I mean how to make
sure that you know all all these eight
actors could potentially use it at the
same time you know they can do different
things in it so we'd have to grow their
idol sets so we don't want them all to
sit Sachi uniform we wanted to be
allowed to have a small offset play
different animations so that's another
thing that was added every place on a
mess table is slightly different like
you can't use the same animation
necessarily to get to sit at the end bit
of a bench as you would when you sit in
the middle of the bench
you actually got more entry points if
coming in from the side of something
than if you come in from behind it as
well so to make it feel natural you
don't want someone to have to walk
around the table in order to get to the
end you want them to be able to use the
shortest path like any human would and
and the ones to get on it as well as
they hold sort of what did it do when
they're when they're at the mess table I
mean if there's eight of them how do you
make it break it up so it doesn't feel
like that their religion is just lined
up in in four slots on each side doing
the exact same things playing through
the exact same sequences like how do you
make you feel natural and as well as
getting off like you know you want to
make sure that they when they when you
come out of a usable you'd always go out
the same way you don't you know always
go out behind you and then set off in
your new direction you might go off like
slightly to your left or slightly to
right because that's where you want to
go next and then I think the complexity
if you take the missile as an example
there's been there's the tables there's
things on the table right it there might
be a clause there might be a plate yeah
you don't need to eat while you're still
using usable when while using usable
you're actually using another thing on
top of it so there's this stacking
behavior that kind of grew this feature
beyond the original I mean if you look
at the hacking laptop it's just the case
of getting their hack for a certain
amount of time they're playing my choose
two cones on the hack yeah and say like
okay I've been interrupted it or that
the
laptop itself says well you've finished
a hug this useful interaction is no
longer available to use you need to stop
using it which means you would play
there play the excess it was a simple
like entry animation leads to like a
looping idle where you're doing
something because of the interaction
you've chosen and then you can either
choose to exit it because you you don't
want to do it anymore you want to
console the interaction or they're
usable itself says well you can no
longer do this so now you need to play
the exits here and so for entry idle
exit but then when you come to a a I
they might want to do lots of things but
when they when they use in the use of
alts
you know they because of this tacking
behavior I mean the same could be true
for something as simple as two laptop
you might you might you might go on to
it you might go like okay I go up in my
lap I said I want to hack it so you know
I'm gonna hack it but then I'm gonna go
like oh actually I don't want to hack it
and I just wanted to destroy it because
my hack failed so I choose like the
destroy options I happened to bring a
glass of water with me I just pour it
over their laptop or forego nothing you
know it's a destroyed and now no longer
allowed to use it there's nothing you
can use it's a destroyed object I think
that the code to destroy it would be
instilled in the item 2.0 well that
would be another component you know this
is a destructible objects so if it
describes it and then that and it's up
to be usable to link an interaction
assess I want to destroy it play the
suitable animation and then its own
point in the animation triggered the
disruption behavior the idea is that
this useable component is like the glue
between like what you can do and what
happens when you do them how do we make
the use of wolves feel more real and
natural I mean a lot of that comes down
to having variation in the animation so
to begin with we had we had kind of
cumbersome like if you look at the entry
alone we had that we had a set up the
bridge was like you would say right
here's our usable we have five
animations so for each animation we say
this animation starts here this
animation starts here
this automation starts here and so on
and then in data you would have to say
okay we set up this point here we linked
that to this animation and then they I
will choose the one that's most natural
based on you know where is moving from
and which direction is coming in from
and try to solve a really nice natural
motion in 2d useable but of course we
realize by quickly that that wouldn't
really scale because now you can have to
you know if you want to create another
one that's another data point and then
you're gonna have to do it off every
single useful that's a lot of data you
have to set up we will basically
approach the problem from two angle
which is we need this quality of
animation this fidelity and that this
basically we needed to look good and
feel alive that's one thing and we're
getting closer and closer to that mmm
getting it just right but the other
thing is we're gonna have to build like
thousand of usable to populate all the
outpost all the landing zones some
insights inside ships on planets and
such inside all of the levels of
squadron 42 we can't afford for it to be
too heavy on production we need to
optimize the process we need it to be
actually fast so we're actually trying
to get all the good stuff without any of
the bad stuff which is we need it to
look good but we needed to go fast we
needed to be smart but we needed to not
take too much time of too much people
and be too expensive on production and
we needed to be able to basically if
someone requests are usable if he gets
if he gets it the day after then my job
is done so what we're doing instead is
we we're just saying like okay give us
all the entry animations and then give
it just like a big group of animations
and then we just extract the movement
from that those animations and we'll
build up the entry points from that
validated points because you know you
don't want to be able to end reusable by
going through another usable of through
another person or if it's outside the
navigation mesh then I wouldn't be able
to find a path to it so we can remove
all these dynamic points we add them
however we want really and if someone
wants to add a new entry point or
different style of entry they just you
know put it in there it builds it the
data dynamically and the more variation
without that when you're already you're
gonna get a much more natural style like
you might have like a way to sprint into
a usable or just walk into a useful as
well that's like getting into it from
like the other side which whichever
whichever feel more natural and gives
you that variation as well because each
animation will have its own little
unique style so you could have the same
usable you can be looking at five six a
is using it and every time they're
playing a slightly different animation
getting in there and then once that once
once you're in the usable itself having
variations in how you look while you
doing that it's another great way to to
give it more sort of more life so making
sure that there's not just a single
single style of sitting lots of
different styles and and and very give
its variations as if you're staying on a
seat for a long time make sure that
constantly shifting around fidgeting
about you know settling into a new pose
we're hoping anyway that that will give
it a more more natural look and another
big thing is of course making sure that
while if you're looking specifically at
the seat that's usable making sure that
you know the upper body is still
available and they can do things like
they can taking glanced around you know
if the play comes into view they can
maybe look at him or just acknowledge
someone else walking past them even
though they're busy playing playing what
should be a usable interaction one of
the thing that the usable has been true
is this this process of actually failing
once which I'm smiling about was
actually painful but the good thing
though is that it just highlights how
energy of the process is especially when
we're trying to push the envelope to do
something new and something fresh
something that has never been done
before
we're doing that we have to try things
and we have to you know sometimes take
things out that we thought worked and
didn't and technique new things in that
we thought weren't necessary and
actually were and so what really has
been good
with the usable is that following this
first failure we abducted a really more
fluid approach where we try something
we'll review it we put it to the best of
you know put it through its paces and if
it doesn't work we change to something
else and we just try to cover every
problem that is thrown our we're not one
by one but as one system trying to make
it evolve to cover everything rather
than try to like extend it over and over
until it crumbles from so looking at but
like the Sprint teams have a sheets but
but the biggest breakthroughs have been
I mean I think the biggest one really
for me personally was when we were able
to get rid of the alignment slot so not
having to say like this is an entry
point this is the animation in place but
being able to just say here is a group
of animations that will let you get into
this usable you can dynamically build
all the data you need in order to select
which one is best for your current
situation and like was doing the same on
the way out to say like hey I'm gonna go
I'm gonna exit this seat or I'm gonna
stop hacking now and I'm gonna go left
you know just making sure like a small
thing like that just making sure that
the exit is already taking him in the
direction that he's now gonna move it's
just such a massive advantage to like
how you scale this and and and and give
this sort of the fidelity that it needs
but then I other things is you know
obviously we use we try to use AI K
where possible to allow someone to be
slightly out of alignment so you don't
have to sit perfectly on a seat you
don't have to get perfect on to the
hacking console you know but it's
constantly allowing a little bit of like
fix up in the extremities so VR needs to
read a reach occult make sure that we're
not forcing you to be perfectly aligned
with that cop that a cop can be off by a
bit that could be rotated slightly
differently and we can we can use a bit
of AI K to get the correction in the
hands of make the the reach feel natural
and look natural and and just try to
reduce snappiness wherever possible
I mean we used same when when
positioning as well you know if if we
need something to be quite exact we
always try to average the correction out
over a longer period of time so that you
don't see that kind of if it's five
centimeters out you don't want one frame
to say now fixing about five centimeters
because it will always you know 60
frames a second but five second five
centimeter leap in one frame will be
noticeable so if you if you can kind of
smooth that out and try to make it as
data-driven as possible you know give
the designers the ability to say like
right do the positional smoothing of
this amount of time say we did okay like
right when do we start okay we've got
two types of okay we try to use we got
animation driven okay which is in the
control of the animator the animator
says like right this is you can use this
okay first of all they can say whether
you can use it or not and then they can
also blend it in and out over time use
that a lot for for weapons like if you
want to reload a weapon your left hand
has to come off the weapon but you don't
want to snap it down to the magazine you
wanted to you know gradually come down
but you might not know where it is
because you might hold the weapon
differently because you've installed
some kind of custom attachment on it
that wasn't there in the original
animation so we had already had offset
your hand to grip it correctly and there
the other type of a I came with more of
a sort of design driven I came where
they can kind of go like right at this
point in the animation I wanted to start
reaching this point this cop this part
of his face you know finished salute you
know fix up a little bit where the hand
goes and that that's more darkness as a
layer on top of animation so you have
the animation and then you have there
the data from the design they're saying
you know how are we gonna blend this in
how we're gonna blend it back out and
what what what hand is moving you know
and where is he moving to what is
actually interesting with the usable
steam in a more human kind of aspect is
like we have basically I'm a member here
in Frankfort we have Jamie over in the
UK and the enca steam is actually
lending hands a lot in the in the UK Ben
Curtis
is working on props and um geometry and
is often lending us his hand from the UK
also but we're also working with Brian
Brewer over in Austin so in the u.s.
today we happen to be doing a pickup
shoot for our usable system we're gonna
be doing things like opening the door we
just finished our door metrics and fin
figuring out what we need for that
the toilets we finally have settled on
toilet metrics so we have captured a
couple little moves that we need to
flush out our toilet system good Adele
we do a little impromptu shoots like
this in order to capture the little bits
and pieces that we've been redoing
realizing that we need with research and
development we have something that we've
been capturing called transitions we are
there are little animations that help us
transition from one animation to the
next what this allows us to do is
anytime we have a big shoot at
Imaginarium studios or if we set up our
full system we have these little
transitions that will help us get into
and out of those those in particular
motions some of the usable is are quite
complex in that if we want to keep
interaction sequence so we might want to
say like take the trade for example well
I say say that when you go up to use the
trade dispenser you actually do the full
sequence you so you go up you get the
tray you get caught you get plate you
get a knife and fork and that's one big
animation but during that one big
animations he's actually gonna have to
like become a owner of a cup become oh
man our plates become owner of a fork
become owner of a knife then release
ownership from all of those and it might
be like a as well because you know wifey
he didn't step all the way up where he
came up in there was a slight angle so
every time he's touching one of those
items we might want to do a small Cade
animation driven or procedural fix up to
two reached item its way its way I mean
you it's where you draw the line right
they they're whole like the whole idea
is that with the usable sister you
shouldn't have to they should be so
scalable that that unless unless we
reach a point where we're going like
right we're taking it too far now this
is going to take too long to support a
scale back and let's simplify this
as long as you can describe it in in the
in data for the code it hopefully
shouldn't be that much different
as you can see usable x' will be an
essential part of the universe going
forward that's why the team has put so
much work into making the system as
robust as possible and we've still got a
lot more work and functionality to add
because being able to interact with a
wide variety of items and locations will
only add to the realism that we're
trying to achieve with star citizen and
squadron 42 and that's all for today's
episode for more information on the
development process take a look at our
production schedule which we updated
tomorrow yes thanks to all our
subscribers for your support we could
only produce around the verse bug
smashers and all our other great shows
because of your guys support so thank
you very much yes and to all of our
backers your interest and enthusiasm to
see a game done differently is what has
made star citizen possible yes it really
has and thank you guys very much as well
and until next week we'll see you thank
you for watching so if you want to keep
up with the latest and greatest in star
citizen a squadron 42 development please
follow us on our social media channels
