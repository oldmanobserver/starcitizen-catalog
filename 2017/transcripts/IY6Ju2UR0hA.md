## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizens ongoing development I'm Sandy
Gardner and I'm Chris Roberts it's great
to have you back Chris yeah it's quite
nice to be back here in La uh and uh did
enjoy getting to spend a few weeks with
our Foundry 42 team in the UK and
Germany reviewing all the awesome work
they've been up to on Squadron 42 and
Star Citizen one of the many things
being worked on by The Foundry 42 team
is the tumbril Cyclone which was
unveiled last week on today's episode
we're going to take an in-depth look at
this rugged new ground vehicle plus we
examine the tech behind game wide
persistence by showing you how it is
used to get one ship to persist inside
another ship's hanger but first let's
check in with Austin and turbulent for
their monthly
updates hey guys Jake Ross here producer
in Austin we're picking up speed with
Gamescom at the 30 release fast
approaching let's jump right in and see
what's been going on here in Austin this
month to start over the last month La
engineering refactor the shopping Cod
enough so that now Austin design team
can start plugging the items back into
the shops this also includes a first
pass of getting the kiosks up and
running for the commodity trading we
have been focusing on getting all the
shops related to the Pu stations and
Landing zones functional first but we we
will also be making a pass with the area
18 shops as well we've now got the
ability to purchase armor piece by piece
so we'll be adding that to the feature
list we've also finally implemented the
remaining ships into the price fixer
tools the price fixer is a spreadsheet
that allows us to see each ship's
physical Loadout see the price of each
item in that Loadout and determine the
overall cost of each ship this is
important because it will allow ow us to
more accurately assign each ship their
respa values which covers the cost and
respa timers for the ships being
released in 3 we also use this tool as a
good way to gauge whether or not the
ships we're building are over or
underpowered for their intended purpose
we are very close to completing this
task and we'll be moving on to balancing
the shop inventories and item prices
that you'll see in 3 after that lead
designer Rob Riner took a trip to the
Frankfurt office this month to work with
the AI and subsumption team and made a
ton of progress on getting miles eart
the mission Giver set up and ready to go
we figured out a lot of work on the
feather blending system and got him
working with a small subset of his
animations since that time we have
received some additional code support to
allow reputation to dictate his
conversation paths with the player we
literally just received the ability to
assign specific missions with mission
brief tags so we can have him playing
different lines depending on what
missions are available Beyond this we've
just been plugging away trying to make
the mission Giver experience as good and
as polished as possible for the 30
release we can't wait to get miles E
cart into your hands and get these
missions for you guys on the art side
Josh Coons finished images and videos
for the cutless black and moved on to
create the base material and white box
meshes for the cutless variants the red
and the blue however while he will
complete the first pass on the exterior
looks for the cutless variant he will
move on to the constant flation Phoenix
next to allow design some time to flesh
out some key gameplay systems for the
cutlasses a little bit more Chris Smith
has been working on bugs for the Hornet
and the constellation Andromeda he will
start moving on a promo video for the
constellation Aila
next the backend Services team have been
supporting three features and preparing
for the deployment of diffusion the game
servers now have full access to the
diffusion API and will start using it
with the shopping service in 3 in
addition we have started converting our
two monolithic Services the persistence
cache and general instance manager into
smaller stateless fully diffusion IED
Services out of those two services will
come nearly a dozen smaller Services
each with very specific roles that can
be scaled independently
these will provide more reliability and
performance most of our work has been
Lower Level under the hood type changes
which do not have any frontf facing
bling to show off going forward we're
plotting the path Beyond 30 and starting
to mild many small services that will
provide functionality and support for a
large number of gameplay features and
help unload work from all the dedicated
game servers into our distributed
infrastructure this month in the Pu
animation team we started the research
and development for how to implement our
wild line system a wild line broadly
speaking is any dialogue spoken by an
NPC the wild lines we are working on are
things like greetings cheers shouts and
other verbal Expressions barked out by
NPCs we are working with a new
technology called feather blending
mentioned previously which allows us to
blend our performance capture of wild
lines with a large number of usable
animations this will give us as close
door actor performance as possible while
still keeping the functionality of what
the NPC is doing intact we are also
going through all of our existing
animations and we are filling in any
gaps missing from from the original
performance capture with new transition
animations the Austin ship animation
team has been hard at work with our
continued efforts to refine the cockpit
and turret experiences we are in the
midst of an R&D phase of implementing
button presses utilizing the item to
Features this has helped finalizing
dashboard and cockpit metrics across the
different ships that use the same
cockpit type the UK Engineers have
refactored some backend systems allowing
us to fully implement the blending of
the base GeForce pose blend spaces
allowing additive animations for button
presses as well as playing different hit
reaction animations based off of hit
Direction damage amount and overall
health of the ship as always we are
diligently at work fixing bugs for our
next big
release the devops team continues to
work on increasing capacity with our
build and deployment pipelines in
preparation for 30 they've also been
making additional changes and buck figes
to support the new Delta pack pure and
so far the internal tests have been
really promising our corporate
technology team or it department has
just completed another major upgrade to
the Austin Network and added more
Hardware to the build system so we can
deliver more builds in parallel our
resident audio team member Jason Cobb
has had his hands full this month as
well he's continued work on der crash
site sound design for the different Moon
environments performed a variety of
particle audio implementation
experiments for revamp ship debris
noises he's tested and mixed refinements
for ship emergency State audio and
captured sound effects for various props
and materials as opportunities
arise July has also been an exciting
month for Austin QA and it's impossible
to describe everything we've been
working on but here are a few things
we've been testing the New cutless Black
while in St we've had a new missions re
and PCs as a big ongoing Focus ship
testing has continued to be very busy as
more ship families that have been
converted to item 2com online large
scale play tests for arena Commander
starm marine and Stanton have been
ongoing weekly alongside our laqa
cohorts and we've also been conducting
cross Studio play tests with the team in
the UK we've also been testing more
mobiglass applications like Starmap the
personal manager the mission manager and
the mission board as they've become
available to QA over the last few weeks
some other fun items we've been testing
are character gravity and freef fall as
well as continued testing of cargo
mechanics we're still providing support
for the animation team here in Austin as
well by continuing to clean up map files
to help free up our animators for other
work our normal engine and editor
testers are still extremely busy testing
new tech for the developers such as
capsule-based actor entity The Entity
component update scheduler and director
actor animation and control some
features like the new stamina and oxygen
breathing systems are getting some
balance changes with QA helping our
designers there as
well the player relations team has been
busy recruiting new team members in
anticipation for 3 in addition to
starting to grow the avocati ranks the
team is adding four people to the Austin
office we're excited to have these new
additions join the team in the runup to
learning and testing for
30 that's everything we got to show you
for this update guys we look forward to
delivering everything we've been working
on to youall in the upcoming release and
at Gamescom thanks for all you do for us
and we'll see you in the
verse hi guys this is Ben from turbulent
and this is your platform update this
week we're going to hear from Paige
Saunders who's going to talk to us about
the upcoming ship Matrix changes and
we're also going to be talking with
Victor banet who's also known in the
forums as in the chat as fulgrim to talk
to us about the next Spectrum update I'm
p and I'm a full stack developer here at
turbulent Montreal I'm working on
updating the ship specifications in the
database to reflect more accurately
where cig are at with a vision on the
the game and the ships that are in it a
lot of new things have been added to the
ship Matrix so we're taking the
opportunity right now to include things
like Quantum drives and Quantum fuel
tanks uh as well as smoothing out all
the existing components to make it more
clear exactly what is in each ship the
challenge with the ship Matrix has been
including the new ground Vehicles into
it so we've added in uh capability to
add ships ground vehicles and anything
else that comes up there's a new sizing
scheme for ships uh so you have weapons
maintaining the size 1 through 12 and
the other components maintain a more uh
easy to understand small medium large uh
system that's related to the ship sizes
so that you can tell what goes in what
ship um and whether a ship has a size
that's larger or smaller than it would
typically have so we've redesigned the
ship detail page so that you can tell
for each component uh what size it is uh
and see from the Icon what type it is uh
as well as uh what it can be upgraded to
and what could also fit in the slot then
you can zoom out and see an overview of
the ship with all the slots that are
currently populated and the slots that
are available for you to upgrade your
ship with backers have noticed that the
ship Matrix in the past hasn't got a lot
of love so we've reworked the database
to make it a lot easier to update from
this point on we're going to be able to
uh as things change in the game quickly
get in there update the ship make sure
that it's up to date and reflects
accurately exactly what the gaming
experience is going to be hi everyone
I'm Victor QA at turbulant you probably
know me as a full gam on Spectrum I am
the I am the QA on the RSI website so
spectrum and the website and a little
bit of the launcher so I'm going to talk
to you today about Spectrum so Spectrum
036 is now on the PTU with the
aati uh 036 includes new features like
uh the new text editor so when you um
when you write something uh on the new
post for example you will have new tools
like uh
hyperlinks format hyperlink formatting
like
the uh the Emoji Toolbox will be there
and more important the preview of the of
the post and drafts so now when for
example you're uh you're busy typing
your your tread and you want to check
what your friend are are saying on on
the Forum or on the chat Lobby you just
you can just go
check what they do and everything will
be saved so now we have draft 036
includes to the mini profile the mini
profile is um like the current profile
but uh with new features like um the
post count and Karma so the post count
will be um imported from the old Forum
so people with a lot of post in the old
Forum won't lose all this
post and the Cora is um once you get
every every every time you get an up vot
on uh um on a Trad you you made or a
comment you will get one comma point and
uh it will be your it will be on your on
your profile too so we'll add a new
feature too which is the jump to new
track reply so for example you know I'm
a staff so I will post something in a
trade and uh a backer would will be able
to just go down the trade see the small
icon of uh stuff reply click on the icon
and we will be directly jump to the the
reply of the stuff and if there are more
than one reply of stuff replies um you
will be able to jump between the replies
with a small button so everything is
good uh this features is available too
for um organizations so you can just set
up it in your setting in your settings
and use it this is a feature that you
ask and we
devop thanks guys for your upate
a little quick note on the launcher uh
the team has been working very hard with
cig engineering to try to get major
progress done on the new Delta launcher
which comes with the Delta Patcher which
is a faster patching method uh the team
has been really working on refreshing
some of the UI elements uh we're keeping
the same UI base but we're refreshing it
with some of the 30 new imagery we're uh
you know changing the entire core of the
application in this update and so we're
going in full swing testing on multiple
platforms
uh you know installation paths at the
same time most of our engineering team
has been working on getting most of the
digital distribution uh channels ready
so that you know we can get get those
objects as fast as possible to you when
you request a game version uh so that
requires also Security reviews and you
know deployment scripts but that's
basically where we're at on the launcher
we're really working hard everybody is
working really hard to get this Patcher
out and uh for you guys for 3 we're
hoping we're going to make it we're
pushing real hard so that's our update
for this week on platform see you guys
next
time miles eart is proving to be quite
the popular test subject for various
systems uh definitely he's the new
cafeteria really um the design and
subsumption teams have really put him
through the paces to get stuff like the
reputation system and feather blending
working all that effort is going to make
for more interesting and realistic NPC
interactions in the game which is our
goal with the introduction of our vast
planetary Tech another aspect of the
game that's recently gotten some extra
attention is our Fleet of ground
Vehicles last Friday we revealed the
tumbril Cyclone yeah we did it's very
very cool and uh let's take a closer
look at the cyclone and its many
variants my name is Paul Jones uh I'm
one of the art directors here at Foundry
42 my name is Steven Hosmer and I am a
tech technical designer at Cloud
Imperium we're sort of starting to enter
into the world of land vehicles that
gives us a wide brief uh the buggy
that's a it's a it's a good one this is
a new manufacturer it's always exciting
to have a sort of Clean Slate according
to the law this this manufacturer this
company been around for a bit used to
sort of provide uh sort of super rugged
vehicles for the military so the Cyclone
is intended to be a uh land vehicle
where you get in and drive around on the
surface of a planet it's supposed to be
like a fun vehicle to drive fast it has
four-wheel drive it's got uh four-wheel
steering also something that you're
supposed to be having fun while you're
driving around on the planet taking
jumps off ramps just doing all the
things that you can in a in a wheeled
vehicle you can sort of tell that it's
got military routs in the way that it's
it's got It's very functional but there
you know there is that sort of hint of
you know knowing its market and it just
wants a little bit of flare so there's
you know there's a touch of artistic
flare designed Aesthetics in there and
now this is sort of like their first
entry into you know sort of uh
manufacturing and providing it and
selling a new vehicle it's based in
functionality basically it's design so
it's very much approached from that
point of view the Ursa Rover I would
call it a tortoise and the uh Cyclone
I'd call it a hair where you have the
the Rover it's going to be you know slow
and steady you've got the cycl clone
which is going to be fast and fun to
drive and then the nox is going to be
like a Speedster that's going to get out
there but it's not going to take as many
hits so it's kind of like in between
that pretty much defines quite a few
things right off the bat you know just
ergonomics you know what it's meant to
do whether it's you know like I said
it's not meant to be a crazy sort of
six-legged vehicle or anything you know
we want it you know it needed to be fast
needed to look super rugged it could
take a hit uh it still sort of you know
has open elements um to it so it's you
know you're still going to sort of feel
the wind in your hair so to speak if you
have any hair you know we sort of hit it
quite hit it quite early on actually in
the process probably within the first
two two weeks we knew where we were
going with it so the modularity is
something that was specified by the
design
Department um and so I think it works
really well you know it's almost it's
it's kind of you know it's very similar
to sort of a real world and sense of
having a truck and then you've got your
flat bed at the back and then you can
sort of add add and subtract basically
the first variant is just the base it's
just a regular buggy with a flatbed on
the back that's meant to carry cargo so
if you're just you know sitting around
on your homestead and you want something
to go from place to place and carry a
little bit of cargo that's the one for
you the next one is the turret version
the TR and that's uh mostly a military
version kind of hearkening back to the
old days of tumbril it has a turret so
you've got a third seat for turret
operator and it's got a 360° Arc and it
can fire any direction it's kind of uh
like an infantry support vehicle like if
your boots on the ground operation this
is your Cavalry this is the the thing
that's going to get in get around get
around uh all the other um troops and
kind of support them the next one is the
uh Recon and the Recon is our n version
I believe and that one's meant to be
something that goes like under the radar
it's got stealth components and then you
can kind of get into like an enemy uh
base kind of scout around use your radar
to find uh imp placements or something
like that use your beacons you can kind
of put them down use them to like light
up a Target that you need like the guys
in the sky to come down and and Rain
fire upon um or you can just use it as a
exploration vehicle you can go out you
can map terrain you can you can go onto
uh one of the planets that has like a
dust storm or something you can drop it
outside of the dust storm Drive in find
whatever you're looking for whatever
objective you're trying to find place
your beacons and say okay hey this is a
landing spot in this storm you can bring
your ship in you can find those beacons
they can call you down you can pick up
whatever you need to get there uh the
next version is going to be the racing
version the
RC um it's mostly just we're taking the
base cyclone and we're putting basically
nitrous oxide in the thing you get the
boost on that thing you can take those
jumps as fast as possible you can get
around as quick as possible it's like if
you're uh like in Baja you know you're
like going over the dunes and you're
like hitting the Boost and you're just
going as fast as possible uh and then
the last one is the anti-air vehicle and
that one has two size two missile racks
so you can either have a size two size
two missile are four size one missiles
and then it also has a countermeasure
package which includes shaft flare smoke
screen and a size One EMP you know you
always think it's good it's interesting
it's you know it's fresh um but you sort
of sometimes you think oh yeah we'll
nail this no problem and then there just
the little things that trip you up and
keep tripping you up and it's just
getting it's just getting aware of you
know all the things that we need to take
into account you know in enters and
exits you know whole cabin all the all
the you know all the instrumentation has
to be in the right place you know and
you constantly sort of jiggling trying
to hit what the game needs and then what
us as artists want to sort of push in
there and sort of experiment with you
know there are a couple of things that
maybe we could have improved on but
we'll you know but when it goes to the
production team we'll have a chat with
Nate we'll have the kickoff and I'll be
like okay this went well was less happy
with this you know maybe maybe you guys
can you know flesh us out a little more
sort of really
Advan again the manufacturer so we know
you know when when we building tumbril
uh Vehicles okay this is this is what we
do these are the these are the these are
the materials this is the you know this
is the cloth this is the metal this is
the paint this is the color here's our
decals here's our here's our UI style
and just sort of clarify all that
basically probably the most challenging
thing is probably always the deadline
the beauty of being this this being the
first one you have a certain amount of
naivity in terms of you're not quite you
know you're doing a land vehicle but
you're not quite sure the problems
you're going to hit and often with this
sort of stuff it's very much you know
you make one change and it has a it has
a ripple effect to the whole vehicle so
make a change to the front suddenly the
front's out of balance with the back so
now we've got to change the back okay
the back's changed now so that's
affected something somewhere else and so
it's it's it's trying to manage all
those sort of little tweaks and changes
and and still hit the deadline basically
so that's that's always a tough one for
me I mean we always do it um but it's
always it's always team effort let's you
know how do we do
it so the Cyclone is going to be a great
addition not only does it look like a
lot of fun to drive all the variant
should provide for some pretty
interesting and varied gameplay of
course one of the main questions that's
popped up is what ships will it fit into
if you're looking for that answer then
check out this week's Cyclone Q&A there
you go and if you're interested in
knowing the tech involved in making that
happen then this next segment is for you
as you'll see getting a ship inside
another ship's hanger and keeping it
there isn't as easy as it seems it never
is my name is Chad mckin and I'm a game
play programmer here in the Los Angeles
Studio we're talking about ship and
ships which is a topic that touches on a
few different systems on one hand you
have just kind of the physics uh and
game code involved to actually make the
ship and ship behavior um work
consistently but there's actually a
whole larger other topic that it touches
on which is persistence um how do you
get the ship in there in the first place
uh you can just drive it in there but if
you park your ship at a space station
log off log back on you really want that
ship to be there the next time you spawn
it you want you to have your dragonfly
or your nox and so the question is how
do we get there in 2.6 this isn't
possible you you won't get that ship
back in your constellation or or
whatever it won't be there but if you do
want it to be there we need a whole uh
host of Technologies in our engine and
in our backend services to support that
behavior it's this little thing that
seem so small that actually requires um
a lot of effort to make work correctly
but that effort also enables a lot of
other behaviors in the game that
previously weren't possible so right now
in in 2.6 what we have is effectively um
a very simple system that just tracks
player accounts and specifically um
loadouts in player accounts so it tracks
your specific Loadout that you have
equipped as well as any vehicles that
own and their loadouts this is fine for
the gameplay that we have right now in
the game so yeah you'll you'll have your
weapons the next time you log into the
game if you do a modification on your
ship it'll be there the next time you
log into the game but if you make any
kind of change in the game world uh or
in kind of inside your ship uh that's
not going to be reflected in any way
because the persistence database doesn't
know anything about it this is a great
limitation whenever you consider the
kind of game that we're trying to make
we want to make this large game this
living world that can change and be
dynamic but this persistence behavior
that we have is completely ignoring all
of the nuances that are required to
achieve that behavior one large uh part
of that is this fact that we're so tied
to loadouts because of that that means
there's no concept of a loose entity so
let's say you have a ship uh a
constellation and you park a nox in
inside it the nox isn't attached to the
constellation right it's not on the wing
a fixed to a a gimbal where a turret
would be it's just lying there in the
ship in order to make that work we have
to completely refactor the way that game
code handles uh persistent data and make
it in such a way that instead of
tracking accounts instead we're tracking
a map of entities that point to parents
and potential uh item ports that they're
attached to and offsets with this
requires is that we need to look in the
persistent data record for the ship
we're going to find all of the children
of that ship so we're going to find all
of the uh item Port attachments that'll
be all the guns and now uh that we've
made some refactors in the Precision
database we can also find Loose entities
in that ship so it's going to find the
cargo uh item that we left in there as
well as that knot that we left in there
as well loose items now also have offset
information in the persistent uh data
data record
that informs the spawning code where to
line them up so we spawn the ship the
constellation we spawn all its children
we SP Laing spawning loose items and we
have to spawn them in the correct
location in zone space so they line up
correctly we also need to introduce them
correctly into the zones of their
parents so that they don't fall out uh
if you don't put the knock in the
constellation Zone um they'll either
Collide and explode or it'll fall out
and just leak into space so we have to
do a lot of fix up in spawning code but
if all goes to plan we spawn everything
in the right order in the right place in
the right Zone comes in you see it it
looks exactly like you saw it last and
works perfectly this makes it to where
something doesn't have to be in a load
out for it to be um physically uh owned
by another entity but that kind of
touches on another thing the old
methodology only had one concept of
ownership you just owned something or
you did didn't and that's fine again
whenever you're dealing with uh your
ships um if you have an attachment like
a gun you've bought that um or you've
acquired it through some means and that
means that you can attach it or not but
in gam playay you may get a hold of
something that you didn't buy it may be
in the game world or it may be something
that you want to take from another
player how do we track that in
persistence well previously just there
was no distinction what we need is a
distinction between physical ownership
and legal ownership so that you can
legally own something you bought it but
you don't physically have access to
anymore because somebody took it from
you it's in their ship now that was
another large set of changes to make
this distinction between physical
ownership and legal ownership it had
large ramifications on how we store and
manipulate the data I had large
ramifications on how we uh do this thing
called Network ownership originally
whenever a server would connect to the
backend services the persistent cach
that the player connected to would make
a request for all of the items that the
player has and it would then ask the
server to entitle these to the new
account then those items are sent to the
server and cach locally they're also
sent to the client and cash locate on
the client what this meant was that
there's a large set of data that exists
both on the game server and on the
client that is mirrored but if any
change need to happen to that persistent
data changes would have to happen
synchronously both on the server and on
the client and this is a large technical
problem previously we kind of avoided it
because we didn't really have this
Dynamic Behavior we had some shop uh
behavior that could change it and we had
some H kind of hack code in place to
manipulate it on the client and the
server synchronously but once we start
having larger systems directly
manipulating this persistent data having
um fragmented clones of the data across
the network is is a huge issue both uh
for security as well as for uh behavior
and Sanity of of the data instead we've
needed to move over to a system where
the server is the authorative owner of
the data and clients don't actually have
a copy anymore instead they have to make
queries to the server whenever they want
to display something so let's say you go
to a kiosk you want to buy some cargo
well instead of directly checking the
data that we have cached on the client
we make a request to the server the
server server will collect all the
information that's required and send it
to the client this makes it to where
it's always up to date it's always
correct and everybody in the network
always sees the same information it also
makes it to where some nefarious
behavior on the behalf of the client
isn't possible anymore because we've
kind of closed off the ability to
introduce uh information that wasn't
there to start with one issue that we
have uh right now is that I mentioned
before was physical ownership and legal
ownership well if we want to establish
physical own ship that means that we
also need to allow for transfer of that
physical ownership to give an example
let's say there's some cargo that's on
um in an outpost on a planet that cargo
might be spawned in with something
called an object container which is just
something that we've touched on in
previous U material that we put out and
so this object container just contains
entities that get loaded into the game
if you want to pick up that cargo and
put it into your ship there's several
steps that have to happen to make that
work correctly first U we need to do the
persistent transfer of the piece of
cargo but there's an immediate problem
that we run into the cargo in the object
container isn't a persistent entity it
got loaded in with the object container
it was never persistent to start with so
we need to do something called promotion
to make it into a persistent entity and
to make it uh what's called Network
replicated then we have to make some
modifications to the way the object
containers work object containers assume
a certain fixed set of entities will get
get loaded in and we're actually
modifying this list so we have to modify
the way the object containers work so
that they can have changes to their uh
entity list uh networked across the
network and to support late joiners so
that anybody who joins in later into the
game sees the changes to the object
container so we've done a promotion to
the uh cargo item we've removed it from
the object container now we're going to
transfer the persistent ownership of
that to the player who picked it up the
player has it it's in their persistent
data record now the player walks into
their ship and they put it into their
ship we do another uh physical transfer
of ownership from the player to the ship
the ship now physically owns it and the
persistent data record is updated to
where the piece of cargo is in the ship
now if the player logs off and the ship
gets
unspawnable and it'll be under their
physical ownership even though the first
player yourself legally owns it in order
to get ships and ships working requires
identifying physical ownership and legal
ownership or requires doing all this
persistent tracking but it's that same
technology that also allows us to make
our game World At Large um more Dynamic
and have more life as far as as its
Behavior so that means that you can make
a change now to the world and that can
be trapped there are some limitations
still um changes in the World At Large
are going to still be what what is
called session level persistence so you
can make a change to a planet or you can
make a change to a space station and we
can track that for the lifetime of that
server but it's tied to that server um
but that does mean that you can start
actually changing the world if there was
some cargo at that space station you can
take it and somebody else won't see it
anymore or um you can maybe leave
something behind that they will see if
you left your ship there well that
ship's still there and someone else can
come along while you're walking around
on that
planet they see this nice ship just
sitting there maybe they'll take it away
and it won't be there anymore and now we
can be begin hooking in criminality
systems to maybe give someone a wanted
level whenever they've taken a ship that
isn't theirs or taken some cargo off a
ship that wasn't Theirs to start with it
also means that if you for instance want
to fly under the radar have some stolen
Cargo in your ship that's not in your
cargo grid so it's not in your manifest
you can do that but that leaves it uh
open for other people to then take your
ship or take that loose cargo easier and
it's going to make pirating more
dangerous and it's going to make uh
cargo more interesting I think whenever
and other things in the game as well
whenever you can take it from somebody
else another thing this allows for is
collecting right so you can if you find
a big Benny's machine in the world you
can kick it around maybe with another
ship got to do some work but if you try
hard enough maybe you can get this big
Vin's machine and you say your
constellation Andromeda cool now you
have a big Vines machine and you take it
with you and you own that thing well you
physically own it at least you you sign
off you sign back on again it's still in
your ship maybe you can find another one
somewhere start a collection you can
have three or four of these you can
trade with your friends give give them a
a big Benny's machine maybe they give
you weapon it allows for uh some more
emergent gameplay you don't necessarily
have to have a gameplay system in the
game that is specifically tracking big
bny's machines but you can still play
with them because now you physically
have access to them and that access is
tracked in your persistence data we're
starting to introduce diffusion which is
a whole new way of interacting with the
backend services that gives us some very
interesting uh possibilities for the
future for 3.0 it's just going to be a
small set of uh diffusion Services um
that are going to be online but moving
forward we're going to greatly increase
the number of these diffusion services
and that has some really interesting
impacts on uh persistent gameplay
because it means that you can now have
some diffusion service that's tracking
an economy and persistent changes that
you make in the world will impact the
economy it will impact the cost of items
it'll impact the location of them maybe
the delivery of them there could be be
services that are delivering missions
the missions can be based on persistent
changes in the world uh you can have
Services based on pirate activity or
Services based on um AI activity it
allows us to have the combination of
persistent data and persistent changes
um to be utilized across the server
instances and um have these Services
enable U more kind of higher level um
behavior and higher level modifications
to in-game actions based on diffusion
Services we're taking it to the next
level to where we can get a more Global
Universal look at persistence we can
start caring not only about player
persistence but the ship's persistence
space station persistence Planet
persistence Universe persistence ideally
we want to move to something that we
call the server mesh which has either a
larger or a single uh mesh of servers
that govern the entire universe and all
the players are interacting with each
other across this large server mesh that
will allow some um truly persistent
behavior in the world so that any one
change that you make on a planet any
planet or on any station is going to be
persisted for all the players across the
entire game it will make it to where if
I leave something on a planet it's not
in one server it's on that planet there
is one planet and that has that change
so 3.0 we're introducing these
serialized persistent variables that
will allow gameplay features to start
tracking persistent information this
will include features such as uh ship
health and player Health as well and
stamina so if your vehicle has the wing
blown off of it and you respond your
vehicle it's not going to have that Wing
if it becomes unflyable you're going to
have to start engaging with some of the
other gameplay systems that we have so
for instance you could have it repaired
at a repair station or if it's beyond
repair or you don't want to go through
the effort you can make an insurance
claim on it if you have uh insurance for
the ship this will be expanded to
include other behaviors in the game so
like I said um damage uh and health for
the vehicle but also stamina for the
player so certain kinds of effects will
be uh persistently applied to your
player there will be other things in the
game such as ammo your ammo is going to
be persistent if you run out of ammo
you're going to have to buy more ammo
it's not going to be the way it's been
where you can just fire away and you
don't have to can be so concerned about
the consequences additionally there'll
be other things the interactable
entities in the game will now have the
capacity where we want to we can
identify certain entities and make their
states persistent so say there's a data
pad that you interact with maybe you
switch Its Behavior to be in an on state
as opposed to an off that could be
tracked and be persistent um we're
identifying every day new places in game
code where we have certain behaviors
that have traditionally just been
networked across the the network to keep
the clients and server in sync but it's
very easy to just turn on this
persistent flag and start having that
now be a persistent value that's tracked
across game sessions so we're looking
for these uh opportunities to take these
game uh gameplay behaviors and make them
more permanent as far as the lifetime of
their effect I think it' be a very
interesting world to play in and a very
interesting set of gameplay features I
really know their game has
so that piece was a great way to show
how all our systems tie together under
the hood it was a massive undertaking to
lay that groundwork but it gives the
game a ton of functionality once
everything is up and running and that's
all for today's episode thanks to our
subscribers for supporting all of our
shows tomorrow we have a special happy
hour Game Dev planned live designer
Gareth Bourne will be building a solar
system using the Sol Ed tool with help
from the viewers tune in to our twitch
Channel at 11:00 a.m. Pacific to catch
it yeah that sounds like that'll be a
lot of fun so you don't want to miss
that uh finally thanks to all our
backers we couldn't build this game
without your continued support we could
not and until next week we will see you
around the verse
