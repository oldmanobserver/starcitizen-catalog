## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse our weekly look at star
citizen's ongoing development I'm Sandi
Gardiner and I'm Jeremiah Lee nice to
have you here today on today's episode
we investigate the new stamina system
gameplay and learned how various actions
will be affecting your avatar in-game
but before we dive in let's focus on the
most important action happening around
the offices alpha 3.0 that means it's
time to check in with eric kieron davis
and the rest of the team for this week's
burn down welcome back to burn down our
weekly show dedicated for being progress
on issues blocking the release of star
citizen alpha 3.0 last week we ended at
94 total must fix issues which was
prioritized as nine blockers sixty two
criticals twenty one highs two moderates
and note reveals so let's check in with
the team to see how we're progressing so
many things about three hours a moment
as we're drilling down more on the 3d PT
u /e became us fix issues tom my and
pause well got some more triage that we
still do we're aiming to get through at
least the the criticals before we
definitely signed off on going yeah
these are the mas fix issues but in the
meantime I'm aiming to send out an email
to the team about the must fix issues we
currently have those the ones we want to
start working on in order to push
forward for evocati so focus on those
the thing about game development is that
with bug fixing and particularly
drilling down on the most fix issues
that we now have is that like most
things in life you can have good days
and you can have bad days with stuff
developers can have a really good day
where they just pull it a thread of a
bug you know something they've been
working on for a little while and all of
a sudden they kind of have that you
reach a moment they pull on it and then
everything else just unravels and it
allows them to fix the next few bugs
stacked up behind that on the flip side
of things you can potentially have a
really bad day where a features got a
little bit further developers of a put
some more fixes in giving it to QA over
to testing and QA goes goes in and
starts testing it and they can go well
that doesn't work there's an issue here
there's one there this one there or you
can get
issue again with a feature or anything
really in that you can come up against
one issue and then extrapolate that out
and QA will just go and down the rabbit
hole essentially and go right well if
this doesn't work well how about if I do
it like this and what happens if it do
this and what happens there and then
there you can end up from that one put
just initial find you can end up with
another six or seven bugs we noticed
there are these occasional black flashes
see one there in Graham Bartow so as we
were going around we kind of family
nurses that just as you approach these
lights they get more and more extreme so
what we're seeing here is actually it's
usually the lens flare that's just
spreading a problem out but what's
usually happiness is something is
divided by zero or it's taking the
square root of a negative number or just
something impossible and so having done
one pixel wrong it then just just smears
it all over the screen so you turn it
off and there's just a little bit of
it's still kind of visible and going
right up to it I think the the depth of
field starts picking it up as well but
you can just see there are these tiny
little lamb' tiny little stipple effects
so when we know that the fog uses this
sort of like jittered and like per pixel
gesturing so this kind of matches the
pattern so like we if you turn off fog
it goes away so it's probably fog and
what we realized is this is basically
when it's doing the rectangular lights
what it has to do is it has to at one
point it takes the position that it's
sampling and it finds the nearest point
on the light near to it and then it
tries to get the the direction to that
so it's sort of subtracts the two
distances and divides by that distance
so if you've actually managed to sample
it dead on the middle of light somewhere
on the plane of the light it ends up
with a zero it divides by zero it just
screws everything so actually we just
put in a very small fix
yeah so literally just checking to see
if it's 0 if it is 0 we just use a
completely different factor that's it's
not exactly the right back to that it
should use but it's it's not visibly
different so yeah it works last few
weeks we've been working on some
shopkeepers and the admin office worker
is sort of like a general-purpose
location or NPC we have whenever you
need to deliver or pick up something
from a location that has lots of kind of
sub like like a station or a truck stop
or something this will be a little a
general point where it'll go there
before it gets you know
delivered out to where it's supposed to
be in the station and as you can see we
have one of our NPCs here who I just got
some new animations from Dave over there
which should hopefully fix this
stretching to talk issue which has been
cursing us from being able to test it
properly or use it properly 43.0 we
we're reworking the turrets for all the
ships and not only with ships but also
you might have seen it in the rover as
well so with the turrets we've added the
ability to you for the designers to
define dead zones and active zones to
control how fast the turret turns back
and forth and then recently we've added
a feature to have you get into a seat
and have the turret rotate while your
wallets getting ready for you to shoot
at enemies or other penalties turrets
are basically like a mini vehicle where
they have seats in them and other sea
components and so our existing code
can't tell the difference between a
currency and a ship seat and so it it
just chooses whatever it finds first so
we have to define no for this turret we
want you to use the turret seas or for
the ship we just want you to use the
term we've got this year a ticket for a
bug that you were randomly dying within
visiting or outposts on one of our moons
it happened in all of them so we had to
open up the editor as you can see here
and find out what the issue was and if
you look here you see that we have these
blue boxes I made them a bit higher than
that posted for this example but this is
the atmosphere that or well this is the
box that contains our room system which
contains atmosphere and actually air so
you can breathe within our locations but
as you can see there's a gap between two
of them or between all of them well it
should look like this
because when they're not touching that
means the air actually just goes nowhere
which makes it like disappear in time so
you would randomly die at different
times because you wouldn't know when
they are actually run side
and that was that bug report with God so
we found out that okay they're not
connected we need to fix this issue our
first solution was actually us to make
all the rooms bigger to make sure they
touched each other and as you can see in
this example here but we soon realized
like or well straightaway realize that
that also means you can breathe outside
you can technically stand on this window
even though it's outside you can still
breathe and survive without a helmet
which also shouldn't happen because
you're one of the moments that doesn't
have air you can breathe so what we had
to do was use their custom shape tool
that lumberyard provides and actually
make these shapes fit so they go out and
extra bit where the door comes so the
room still touch each other but they
don't reach outside so you can actually
not stand on the outside also being able
to breathe at the time of filming this
we've reduced our total must fix issues
by 18 which brings us to 76 issues
stopping this first release at the same
time we've checked in a total 773 new
updates to the 3.0 branch and now this
week we've also made some more important
decisions on what we'd like our first
round of non CI G testers to help us
evaluate as well as provide feedback on
and keep polishing and fixing we're
really going through this release with a
fine-tooth comb making sure all of the
new tech and features work harmoniously
together so while we're all passionately
working to knock out the mountain of
blockers as matt said uncovering one
thread may unravel and reveal a whole
myriad of issues that we always hope
will knock out more than one big issue
at a time but putting my personal dreams
aside as we're completing and polishing
features those numbers are going to
change and sometimes dramatically
sometimes higher sometimes lower so come
back next week to see how we're doing
here on burned-down
for a more detailed look at what bugs
we've been smashing be sure to check out
our 3.0 production schedule report which
we update every week on our website now
it's time to talk stamina the dev team
has worked hard to build a robust
stamina system that takes numerous
factors in consideration to provide a
more realistic experience for example if
you
into combat you'll discover that your
aim will suffer due to the deep breaths
being drawn by the character or worse
that you don't have the stamina need to
escape if the situation goes south
creating a system that requires players
to think strategically what their
movements was one of the many goals that
team had to tackle to see what else had
to be considered when designing the
system let's take a look at this week's
feature
the actor status system started the life
as a much smaller piece which we're
trying to figure out how to breathe in
space how to breathe also how to
suffocate in space how that works the
initial implementation was a pretty
dodgy thing we did just so we can get to
zero out the door we're putting some
kill triggers outside the airlocks just
to make sure people don't walk outside
in their t-shirts obviously people
managed to do that because of our wall
collisions not being 100% there and
people ended up floating in space in
their t-shirts not not such a good thing
so eventually we started working heavily
on the system but there were a lot of
other things that had to come online
before this system could actually be a
fully functional the main thing that had
to come online was our room system our
room system defines the space of every
room what the atmospheric composition is
in each of these rooms and how air
travels from one room to the other the
other problem we had to deal with was
how to how do doors opening and closing
react to this our doors initially did
not support this feature so we had to
read or out all our all our doors all
our airlocks elevators so that when the
door opens it actually allows gases to
travel from one one room and another the
standard component defines a default
seminar course the default seminary
generation as well as the requirements
to maintain optimal seminary generation
on every breath the standard component
queries the room system for the
atmosphere composition and volume of the
current room then replaces a fraction of
the oxygen in the room with carbon
dioxide and updates the seminary
generation based on the amount of oxygen
replaced if there's no oxygen in the
current room there's no regeneration and
the player has a limited amount of time
before suffocating the stomach component
in we were able to implement a life
support system for the player to survive
in space by turning the players helmet
itself into a room so the Perito
matically enter this room when equipping
the helmet and the stamina system can
maintain optimal regeneration because
the room quays will always find the
helmet
we also added a guest purifier that
removes noxious gases from the helmet
including carbon dioxide and a gas tank
that maintains the pressure in the
helmet by feeding it oxygen when it
comes to having no helmet on or simply
having a helmet that does not have a
breathing system you will be not be
connected to your suit you will breathe
whatever is available in the room and
that will have some consequences
especially when you get into places that
either have low pressure or not enough
oxygen in the atmospheric composition in
the room or simply noxious or poisonous
gases in the room so that will create an
interesting gameplay and we're trying to
make sure the player doesn't always keep
his helmet on it should become fairly
costly to keep a helmet on as this
brings a lot of interesting gameplay
possibilities to star citizen where you
have to rush to to a suit locker get
your suit quickly on because your ship
is getting depressurized and there's no
other way you either get to that suit or
you die now the the main stem a consumer
is the players movement well the player
is moving their standard reins depending
on stance equipment weight and movement
slope so walking up the stairs is more
expensive than walking down the stairs
so basically every action the player
does consume stamina if you're sprinting
jumping crouching vaulting over
obstacles that will consume stamina even
idling consume stamina just on a very
low scale compared to the other actions
we want to encourage the player to think
tactically when they perform actions we
don't want them to just constantly run
bunny hop everywhere we're trying to
achieve a level of realism here
basically people who constantly abuse
their actions and not think about what
they're doing will get punished while
people who are mindful of every little
thing they do will get an advantage
consider yourself sprinting into combat
for I don't know 30 seconds and when you
get into combat you're so out of breath
that you're just can't counter further
for everyone else you're aiming will be
really bad your recoil will be
unmanageable if you won't even be able
to get out of trouble because you don't
stamina to sprint away from the from the
mess you got yourself into so this way
people who arrived fresh in combat will
be way more effective effective than
people who've just rushed there and yeah
not too much walking instead of
sprinting will still consume some
stamina but your regeneration if nothing
is wrong with your character like like
chess room there's something like this
they will still regen more than you
consume where when you when you walk but
you also have the option of completely
stopping and when you completely stop
then you get the maximum region because
your character is not doing anything
he's he's still consuming stamina
because he's idling because we want to
start consuming oxygen of the vir oxygen
tank
basically if you just idle in two hours
in space you might run out of oxygen but
if you sprint for ten minutes you might
run out of oxygen it's the same because
you start consuming way more the player
abilities are the secondary consumers of
stamina an ability consists of a type
stamina requirement assembler cost and
two check points in the game code saying
okay this is where this ability starts
and this is where it ends you can only
access this part of the code if your
stamina is higher than the requirement
for it the cost can also be processed in
different ways there is instant cost
like for jumping or vaulting there's
lasting cost like for sprinting and
holding breath and there's also
conditional cost which is instant cost
that depends on what other abilities are
running at the time and all that was
good until well we added equipment
weight into the mix jumping with heavy
armor and the railgun in your back
on Jupiter is a lot more expensive than
jumping with a light armor on the moon
so this meant all abilities suddenly had
variable costs so the designers couldn't
reliably adjust the ability cost to
ensure the fair experience we fixed that
by taking the remaining stamina into
account instead of current stamina so
instead of saying you need 20% stamina
to be able to jump we are saying
jumping is not allowed to drain your
stamina below 10% to show the player
status we are using different
combinations of post-effects
the problem is when several status
conditions are using the same post
effect like for example when bleeding at
low health and those
and all these conditions modify the
brightness so we needed each effect to
be noticeable enough on its own but also
not go crazy when stacking with each
other so implemented a centralized
component that runs with customizable
rules with a new implementation you can
say for example all contrast modifiers
after the first one have their strength
reduced by 50% and together they can
never exceed a certain value the buff
system has been in the game for a while
but we never really had a reason to use
it extensively buffs are pieces of data
that consist of a type a value and
sometimes a time limit their purpose is
to allow virtually anything in the game
to modify the player status using a
simple interface the actor but component
receives all the buff requests and
automatically stacks the buffs of the
same type together and broadcast the new
value over the network bleeding is
implemented as a debuff in game right
now when a body part takes damage it
applies a stack of bleeding with a value
of 1 that means the player will take 1
damage per second from bleeding taking
damage the other body part applies an
additional stack of bleeding so the
player will now bleed for 2 health every
second healing one of these body parts
will remove the corresponding buff the
buff component together with the stamina
health breathing abilities ng force
components make up what we call the
actor status system we use it to change
the gameplay experience depending on
what happens to the player so for
example in the new version 3.0 well
taking damage to the arm will affect the
player's combat abilities like recoil
and weapons way damaging the legs will
affect navigation reduce the movement
speed and increase the seminole cost for
jumping and sprinting damaging the torso
will decrease your stamina pool and
regeneration running out of stamina or
pulling too many G's will make the
player pass out and so on one of the
important things for us was that the
player understands what is happening to
them just having stamina there is not
enough the player constantly needs to be
aware by looking at his screen what
condition the character is and we had to
employ a lot of smaller tricks in
getting the player to figure out oh I'm
running out of breath I should stop a
bit catch my breath or oh my oxygen
is out so we had to go add a lot of
visual effects on the screen when you're
running out of breath we had to add a
lot of audio breathing we had a lot of
animation additives happening to the to
the player we had to affect the players
aiming moving up and down with every
breath it's also a lot of UI work that
had to go into this to tell the player
what's going on at every every stop step
of the way
on your visor you get information about
what's in your suit what what's your
condition how much stamina do you have
what's in your suit
what what's in your tank what's in your
suit what what your stamina is but if
you want informations about the outside
then it's the mobile apps right now that
gives you all the information about the
room that you are in my role based on
the system was to outline the sound
design elements of it speaking with
design and codes and animation and
basically coming up with a sound design
system that would be able to play
breathing sound effects in relation to
what the actors act the state system was
doing I work closely with you and Braun
use one of our audio programmers and
together we kind of start to build this
system be able to give audio feedback to
what the actors state system is doing so
the player can have here's what the
player character is doing e audio
component drives the animation of the
character for therefore the breathing
that is going to sink so the audio will
sync with the actual animation of the
character breathing and also on the mobi
glass you've got the heart rate monitor
and we will be syncing with that as well
so heart rate breathing rate will all be
in the sink it's all driven from the
same system the first step for me was
doing better research to find out what
breathing styles we're going to need and
the relative speeds and characteristics
so I thought the best thing to do was to
record myself I rather than getting some
talent in because I didn't know if it
was gonna work and what I did first of
all is set up a tempo mat I decided to
go along and just record myself at
different beats per minute bpm so we
started it 20 beats a minute and then
every couple of hours I increase the
speed by 5 bpm so arranged from 20 BPM
ups 119 BPM so in that actual time we
from a three-second inhale and
three-second exhale up to a point three
of a second
inhale and point 3 of a second exhale
which is really really fast so I a lot
of fun calling that the the benefit of
recording to the tempo map is you've got
a lot of variation and you've got a lot
of assets that very very quick however
the downside was I didn't realize how
breathing rapidly without needing to how
much I could measure well I did nearly
pass out a couple of times at the upper
end of the BPM scale fortunately did and
once I got enough material what I did is
I had edited all together so I split all
the inhales and all the exhales for the
specific BPM and then bounced them all
out of Reaper so I had individual inhale
assess and exhale assets the actor
stated system sonically consists of
three main elements so you've got the
breathing styles which the different
types of breathing then we've got the
grunts and vocalizations and then we've
also got the SFX support so that's like
sound effects relating to your suits
like alarms and my UI elements to fight
that currently we have 13 breathing
styles that will most likely increase
that's currently split across two Suites
so we've got a breathing suite full FPS
so we're just running around so we also
have a breathing suite for piloting
because in those two different
situations you will be using different
styles of breathing so in FPS you'll be
having normal breathing recovery
breathing when you're fatigued taking
damage and injury but then when you're
piloting we use specific breathing
styles for that situation one of them is
called a GSM which is anti g-force
straining maneuver also known as the
hick technique and it's a technique
eyelets used to stop passing out over
high G's
it kind of like the force my boss their
blood pressure to remain high in like
their head and stuff like that it's when
you're pulling really high G's you start
here and going
what's loads of reference material and
that the kind of that the stresses and
strains and pilots put themself through
is insane though the game actually calls
discreet inhale and exhale
triggers just great the love of modality
we've got is brilliant so the active
state system and the audio component in
and pass particular values in relation
to stamina Oh to health even like
composition of the oxygen and the
atmosphere in the room that feeds into
audio components which are control
through fired a torch there's a day
forward record that I can control the
breathing Suites the breathing styles
and all the conditional transitions and
through that I can dictate which
breathing style is played at a certain
time and how that breathing style
correlates to the values that are being
passed from the active state system so
the actual audio exists in wise which
are audio middleware tool with this is
what the third currently 13 different
styles are breathing they're all live in
their own discreet actor mixer hierarchy
within that action mixer there's a blend
container which contains inhales and as
a blanket a no that includes exhales so
uniquely be triggered independently one
after the other and within that they
each have a range of random containers
ranging from the 20 bpm all the way up
to 190 bpm and then the blown containers
actually respond to an RTP C which is a
real-time parameter control which takes
values from the actors data system and
the audio component and that selects
which of the BPM breaths it should play
ah then the game calls the the play
trigger which is like play breath inhale
or prey play breath recovery exhale it
triggers it from wise and that's what
you hear in the game the the animation
for the breathing is driven off date
forward record and you control the
controller curves of the breathing which
can influence the curves of the
animation for audio it represented a
unique challenge for us because normally
we're at the end of the stream but
downstream process normally everything
gets done we put audio to it this is the
first time I've ever worked on a system
where audio drives another feature so
audio is actually driving animation so
we have to make sure we sync with
animation very closely because normally
our footprint is post it's never
normally it directly impacts the input
of another department have
after singer you can't have a breathing
and breathing going in and out and the
animation going out and in always
involved with the breathing animations
the procedural breathing animations and
so making the players arms and chest
move up and down a series and and mostly
focusing on going in sync with the audio
and getting the feedback therefore the
player once they're tired or exhausted
so the system itself is fairly complex
in the backend there's a lot of sort of
variables involved in a lot of different
states and levels to it but from the
players point of view we try and keep as
simple and easy to read as possible
because obviously it's it's all about
player feedback of it and being able to
see all I'm tired oh I'm exhausted and
it's slowed down about need to stop
discern myself and sort of communicate
match them sort of simply and easily
while also having the complex here at
the backend system and having these sort
of more advanced systems and behind that
it doesn't saw you down but it will tell
you that you're more tired and you won't
be if you're running along you won't run
slower but you'll run heavier and the
audio will get more intense you'll
breathe heavier your arms will move more
and I'll have more of effect of when
you're trying to aim at someone if
you're exhausted your aim is gonna be
all over the place
and obviously this is quite a it's
fairly subtle at the sort of normal
standard levels and you wouldn't really
know so that's the whole point in the
breathing system if you're doing things
normally you don't notice your breathing
and that's only when you're probably
exhausted when you've really been
exerting yourself and he will go
vertical no your pant in your arms are
moving about your chest is heaving and
you'll be exhausted from the breathing
animation point of view the primary
feedback for the breathing that's the
audio that's the thing normally in games
that you hear yourself breathing that's
how you know you're tired the main thing
was getting the animations to match up
with for sodium we can't use just a big
kind of nation because the breath
lengths are different you breathe deeper
or shallower a long bridge the deep
breaths take short rest so we couldn't
we thought about maybe having animations
captured and then blending between them
and lensing them or shorten them and
then we had to go procedural and the way
we did always we've got curved it and
that comes directly from my after or
from the animators till we pull that
into their forge via script that was
running they're all paused and in the
Arabic and then that day is then read
the game and it can be played by because
just to speed over our own times
obviously I'd Stadio tells us this is
going to
your next breath we go that's how long
that mission has lost and also ties into
the imposed system and so an lumberyard
you've got our name pulls over top the
player which determines where he's
aiming and so that plays on the best
that by the last layer it plays on the
animation and that points the gun where
he's looking am I just some F he's
looking straight up that points the gun
shop if he's looking down he looks
straight down and then obviously
suggested four different weapons and
maybe eight different pavatt points and
such using the procedural animation we
can put it over the top of the impose
and so if you're looking up you breathe
correctly over there a direction and it
all and works smoothly and it works not
intrusively as we started only with a
breathing system we were we thought our
job is mostly done but eventually we are
asked whether we can add the GeForce
system to go through the same process
because it's basically just forces
acting on the player and causing various
good or bad conditions on the player so
the current GeForce simulation the the
one in the live version right now is
very accurate it's very realistic it
goes as far as simulating how the human
body naturally adapts under the effect
of g-forces however moving forward we
need a more generic simulation that
works with any type of entity in any
context not only human players piloting
a ship and we need it simple enough to
be able to run on all entities at all
times for example we need unsecured
cargo to fall over when the ship
accelerates our new solution monitors
the accumulated velocity of the entity
and all the physics grids they are are
inside of so we take the linear and
angular velocity of the entity
transformed them into the parent space
and add the parent velocities and
transform them into the parent space and
so on until there's no parent and then
we can track any change in the
accumulated velocity any change in
velocity means acceleration and
acceleration means g-force this kind of
became the birth of the actor status
system which is a larger unifying system
kind of brings together every little
thing that can happen to the actor to
the player or to other characters so we
wanted that all the effects that appear
on the screen of all the things that
happen to him go through the same filter
as
don't want them to conflict with each
other if we would have made separate
system for for every little thing that
can happen to the player let's say he's
hungry or he's thirsty
or he is affected by g-forces or he's
out of breath each of those would have
conflicted with with the other and that
would have been a nightmare for all of
us so that's why we had to unify and
this became the actors data system it
seemed to take off and every single idea
from how the player reacts to g-force
and exhaustion and being able to do
abilities like jumping and jumping over
ledges are all affected by this we've
got at the grunts and the other zones in
his dialogue only to interact with the
breathing so it's becoming rather
complicated so I've set up a system in
the code to to link quite a few
different systems
the lungs of the players are how he
animates and how that affects the the
warble of the gun needs to be driven by
the breathing and that needs to be in
sync with the audio that we've provided
the challenges we had were you know we'd
start off with something simple and it
would work fine for one scenario so we
basically just try sprinting and and
when you stop sprinting it quickly
became apparent that it didn't sound
very little realistic so he just quickly
start breathing at a normal speed and
and we would expect him descend
exhausted for a lot longer so to find
general of that to how long it takes to
recover and how he sounds ways when he's
recovering later on to need styles of
breathing so that one boys their
recovery stellar breathing so when you
send exhausted he deeper longer brace
until you've recovered I set up a system
using our usual user interface for the
dev team data Forge and we started off
with just basically it looks like a
table of numbers and parameters for the
different ranges of breathing speeds and
lung volumes that would need to be taken
in to give the player the amount of
oxygen back into his system to make him
recovery stamina which is you know vales
miracle of the breathing given the
amount of oxygen in the atmosphere or
the room we calculate um how much
stamina you can regenerate so for each
breathing style we tend to have a Bezier
curve to make it possible to fine-tune
the amount of time of these go or needs
translates into how fast these needs to
breathe or how deep
mr. brief quickly from lair realized we
had so many different styles of
breathing like when you're injured or
recovering from exhaustion or piloting a
ship and experiencing high g-force the
transitions between these became so
complicated to manage we couldn't just
do a straight interpolation in between
each one I set up a new thing which we
termed a breathing suite so that was a
flow graph set up they joined them all
together with with different transition
nodes and the transition itself we'd
have a flexible number of conditions
that would make it follow the different
parts of the flow graph to a different
style so we've expanded that with so
many parameters like checking the health
or the stamina or the g-force or whether
you're blacking out and we can get it to
react in in so many ways that make it
sound realistic that I think we've got
more than 14 different styles and it
really gives the player a feeling that
that's something realistic is happening
so the active status system in general
attracts a whole lot of variables things
like exertion you have stamina of course
and that all ties into the room system
which has oxygen but you know a room may
not have just oxygen has other things
you know might not have full pressurized
atmosphere so it's important for the UI
to sort of communicate state of your
surroundings are you know so what kind
of oxygen is present and your current
atmosphere basically so if you go into
an airlock and you know you depressurize
then your oxygen tank won't refill
anymore
or if you're on a planet with low oxygen
or there's a low atmospheric pressure
then you know that your oxygen tank
probably wouldn't we feel as quickly the
would in a regular atmosphere one of the
big things that we that we tracked in
the UI is as basically an ECU graph
which is an indication of your stamina
so if you run up a flight of stairs or
you know you sprint for a long time then
you obviously see your heart rate going
up your ECG graph getting a bit more
intense so then that kind of lets you
know that you're exerting a lot of
energy and you're maybe take a rest if
it's getting too high so it's very it's
it's cool because it's not like exact
value that you're saying it's a bit more
indirect just kind of cool and then you
know it's a nice visual in terms of the
UI as well
this is display on your mobile glass and
we're also going to be displaying on on
vizor as well so I mean obviously and
kind of a very important piece of
information that you pretty much want to
have most of the time and be available
to you at all times we have it in the
hood but there's additional information
in the lovely glass that we have I was
the another good thing to know about
actor status is what is the state of
your surroundings so in your immediate
atmosphere because you know you can go
in and out of rooms different planets
might have different atmospheres
different atmospheric pressures
different atmospheric compositions and
not all affects how quickly your gas
tank would refill let's see if you're
running low on oxygen or something you
want to refill it or whether or not it's
safe to take off your helmet or not you
can pull up your mobile glasses to see
kind of like in that movie the Martian
where it's checking its status for
planning ahead this will be only
dependent on the tools the players have
we want to give them the most basic tool
which is the mobi glass to just check
what is available in their room right
now but they might have access to some
better equipment which gives them they
can scan two three rooms ahead or look
at the door and go what's on the other
side that will help them choose whether
they open a door whether they don't also
on the doors the the refactoring of the
doors we have indicators now that what
the conditions are on the other side you
always get the warning there will be a
red light if something's wrong on the
other side you will not be able to you
will be able to but it's your concert
it's your problem if you just want to
open a door to outer space it's but the
game kind of gives you the information
it's up to you to whether you use it or
not and you will suffer the consequences
if you don't work on the actor status
system will not stop here this will be a
long ongoing process of adding multiple
things to the conditions that can affect
the player we're talking here from small
little things of basically getting
poisoned from whatever's in the room to
getting drunk needing to go to the
toilet all the little things that can
affect the player temporarily and then
we can expand this to go even to stuff
like long-term diseases
and all kind of depressurisation
sickness radiation sickness and all
these things that won't be something
that the player can get rid of instantly
they will have to go find the medical
specialist in the game that can treat
those things and that treatment might
take a while we'll have to see how do we
implement that but the possibilities are
pretty pretty large here the an ultimate
goal for the actors data system is to
have the blue have it support multiple
races as they get introduced into star
citizen and world players will have to
be aware that certain races breathe a
different atmospheric composition when
they enter their ships and their
territory they need to be aware that you
cannot just remove their helmets and if
they have to deal with these races as
and transport them across the universe
they have to cater for those races needs
they can't just shove them in a place
full of oxygen they might not like that
they might simply suffocate or they
might have at first conditions to
certain chemical elements that you must
just love there needs to feel really
nice too you need to be aware of every
little thing that's happening in the in
the world you need to be aware of this
room might be completely the pressure
right that's the pressurized that's why
we give the player tools they have the
mobile glass app that they can use to
check oh this has 0.1 poisonous gas this
does not have enough pressure this
oxygen is too much here rather than just
too little and you might have a
hyperoxia problem of if you breathe that
for a lot of time so it's it's just
players need to be aware we give them
the tools to be aware of the environment
but they need to check and make the
tactical decisions and the good choices
whether that allows them to survive or
not
as you saw stamina is but one component
and the actor status system combining
stamina with these other factors like
health and g-forces makes your avatar
feel more like a real person not just a
game character yeah this new system also
creates a lot of interesting new
gameplay scenarios players must consider
how the armor they're wearing or rooms
atmosphere condition might affect their
stamina decisions like that will help
make the game feel more immersive well
that's all for today's episode thanks to
