hello and welcome to around the verse
our weekly look at the development of
Star Citizen I'm Sandy Gardner and
joining me today is farest stepan
welcome back to the show hey it's great
to be here Sandy there's so much
happening at Star Citizen it's good to
be here sharing it all with the
community I've heard there's something
new going on with the referral program
is that true yes it is true for those
that haven't heard the referral program
rewards anyone who gets a friend to
download Star Citizen using their unique
referral code soon we'll be adding new
levels to the reward lad and if you
already have the points for the new
levels uh will you still get the new
rewards yes you will as they'll be given
retroactively but what I'm excited about
is the new referral competition that
we're going to launch at the same time
as the updated referral program I don't
want to spoil the official announcement
but all I can say is pink dragonfly W
that is pretty sweet uh I love the
dragonfly and also love pink not a lot
of ships can operate both Planet Side
and in space and with a holiday this
weekend we're actually holding a sale
that includes the dragonfly and three
other mini ships the Merlin Archimedes
and Argo and we're having a free flly
this weekend so if you've been thinking
about playing Star Citizen you can try
out the Super Hornet for free both
offers start tomorrow and end on Tuesday
we also have an exciting bit of news to
share tomorrow this 3.0 production
schedule will be released there will be
some great new features that Chris will
go over in the newsletter we have a
great piece coming up in today's show
we're taking a look at the agis Javelin
in a brand new ship shape that's right
but first let's go to the UK for their
Studio
update hi everyone I'm Aon Roberts and
welcome back once again for the UK
Studios update I'm actually visiting our
La studio today so these surroundings
may be familiar to many of you anyway
back to our update on what we've been up
to over in the UK as always things are
really busy there and we're in the
middle of a large number of Sprints for
both Squadron 42 and Star Citizen so
let's start with the technical Sprints
from the programming Department the
player interaction Sprint is proceeding
at full speed we now have subobjects
highlighting so now rather than
outlining a whole mesh we can choose
individual Parts this is especially
useful in cockpits when you want to
interact with individual buttons and
switches a new placement system has also
come online so you can choose where and
with what orientation you set down
[Music]
objects if the position you want to
place an object is out of range we now
automatically go into a frow state
finally we've been spending time making
sure the new interaction system works
seamlessly with the multifunction
displays the player status system has
also been worked on we are adding
different active states such as jumping
or vating and mantling to the player
finds it harder or even impossible
depending on how fatigued they are we
have added in the mass of the of the of
the suits and weapons to influence the
player stamina as well as creating a
breathing State component to bring
together the player status with the
procedural breathing animation and sound
we are now starting work on new gameplay
elements like soup punctures oxygen
recharging and
depressurization we've also invested
time in the conversation system Tech
creating a tool to help simplify setting
up complicated conversations when you
got multiple actors all part of the same
scene moving on to our UI team the
frontend skeleton framework for kios
shopping has started this includes
properly setting up all our UI
components such as lists grids buttons
text fields and other various assets
once this is done the engineers will
bring it to Life by hook looking these
components up to the game data and
getting it presented diagetic in the
game World we're also working in
conjunction with the player interaction
system to unify the way the players will
interact with in-game UI screens across
the board in order to achieve
consistency in our user
experience this means the same
underlying system to interact with an
MFD in a ship seat will be applied to
all- in-game terminals wall mounted
displays and kiosks making interaction
with in-game displays feel much less
clunky and constrictive in anticipation
of the graphics team work on the new
render to texture Tech the UI team has
done a round of testing using our
current helmet Interiors to see how well
the UI could look rendered onto a glass
surface on the interior as opposed to
our current solution the new rtt tech
will eventually allow the UI to render
properly in the rendering pipeline
making it feel much more integrated with
the game world than if it than it is
currently what we're mainly checking for
at this point is how well a text will
read at various sizes as well as any
post-processing knock on that might
potentially negatively impact the
legibility of the UI such as motion blur
or chromatic
aberration another thing we're watching
out for is what kind of impact the new
incoming Dynamic field of view system
might have on the UI the new Dynamic
field of view system will allow such
things like the hood and 3D helmet
interior to remain roughly the same size
on screen when setting a lower or higher
field of view the audio team has been
involved in all gameplay features like
the buccaneer surface Outpost Squadron
level development and the active status
system work has continued on the audio
propagation system to make audio respect
walls doors and paths our current system
just has audio triggers playing from
their point of origin and either being
occluded or unoccluded but always
playing from their Source position the
new propagation system will mean that a
sound playing inside the room will
appear to anyone listening from outside
the room to emit from the door a window
or any other opening this extends to
other rooms so a sound playing for rooms
away will navigate the doorway and the
area in between in order to reach the
listener also the first and second pass
of the mix management system has been
completed this is a virtual mixing
console that can be applied to certain
areas or rooms it allows the creation of
mixed snapshots that can apply volume
filter or effect settings on any parts
of the audio mix with Fades and data
Forge that can be tweaked in real time
setting up and organizing these areas
and mixed snapshots will allow for easy
adjustment of the audio
mix finally a lot of progress has been
made on the wordup dialogue tool to
manage the huge amount of spoken lines
in the Pu in the Pu and s42 Charlie
points
last bastards took Charlie the concept
team has been working on finishing off
the Gemini ballistic shotgun and a new
ship weapon manufacturer known as
preacher in terms of the environments
and structures work has been continued
on the truck stop Interiors satellite
Interiors microt new Babbage and
dressing for the modular habitation
modules the environment team has been
refining the surface Outpost with
technical engineering and habitation
spaces coming together with their
preliminarily dressing
passes the exteriors are now mostly
complete we are also looking into
lighting variations for the procedure
system to add more complex setups for
the lighting States the gray box for the
truck stop space station is continuing
and now all the building set pieces have
been established and we are now in the
detail phase
[Music]
on the satellite Sprint the
communication archetype is close to
being white box complete which mean the
modules and classifications that were
specified by Design have been visually
explored our ship team has been
continuing work on the hul SE and
reclaimer as well as including the new
light controller

we have a big update from the VFX team
this week on the ship VFX side the Drake
Buccaneer is now in 2.6.3 and it's
flight ready also more work has gone
into the RSI con Aila during this flight
ready pass the m perspector has had the
Frost's first pass and damage R&D
blocked the new GPU driven engine Trails
have have also had completed their
initial implementation passs and work is
continuing on
this on the weapon VFX side we've
improved our style guide bringing a new
system that helps us to define the
visual style of a weapon based on
manufacturer and energy type the kwe
Gallant energy rifle rework has in its
first pass along with the APR Scourge
rail
gun
and KS devastated plasma
shotgun we've also rolled out our
layered impact
Library previously our impacts were per
weapon and per surface type but the new
setup allows us to layer up individual
Elements which give us more flexibility
and less
maintenance the animation team has been
working hard on a lot of technical
aspect groundwork and previs this past
month work includes improving the
functionality of the shouldered weapon
state to get the rail gun ready and
playable for 3.0 as well as polishing
the functionality of the prone Set uh
making it ready for code to work their
magic on fixing any edge cases breathing
and stamina work has continued to be
polished to create a solid look and feel
for for a player breathing across
multiple States um you know such as
normal tired and
hyperventilating the no weapon jumps are
getting a pass to bring the animations
more in line with the Moab rather than
the techn first pass portation we gave
them and there has been a lot of
continued iteration of improvement of
weapon reloads across the Devastator
shotgun Gallant arrowead rail gun and
the new
pistol meanwhile the Derby Studio has
continued with facial animation for
squadron 42 cinematics and Star Citizen
they attended a facial shoot down in
London for 3.0 and members of the team
took a trip out to a the LA studio for
some exciting facial animation R&D
meetings this should really help us
speed up production of the huge dialogue
needs for both Squadron and the Pu well
anyway thank you again that's it from
that's it this month from Foundry 42 UK
I hope you all had a good glimpse into
all the areas we're focusing on in the
studios here as always I really want to
thank all the backers for giving us the
opportunity to make this amazing game
and of course our subscribers who
through their continued support allow us
to get all these updates out to the
community take care and I'll see you in
the
verse that brings us to our next segment
when designing a new spacecraft it's
important to look at other ships from
the same manufacturer yeah there's a lot
to be learned from the past development
applying these lessons to the new
designs uh for new spacecrafts can help
speed up the development process
significantly which is also which is
exactly what the ship artist on the
javelin on the agis javelin did so take
a
look
[Music]
oh
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Applause]
[Music]
he
[Music]
n
[Music]
the the javelin was was really kind of a
byproduct of we needed another another
capital ship supplied to the uee uh in
the game um we already had the Idis um
we knew it was going to be agis
manufactured so I kind of wanted to
extend the style and aesthetic of the
the hydis into the javelin um not only
for the interior stuff but also the
exteriors so from a production point of
view the the the javelin we had the
wealth of experience that we we'd
learned from from developing the
Idis um and really kind of we could
almost kind of so we say hit the ground
running um so there was aot of
similarities in the aesthetic and and
the general kind of design between the
Idris and the javelin it's really about
kind of taking that aesthetic and those
spaces and recycling you kind of hear me
on about the 60/40 split recycling about
60% of the Idis and then putting the 40%
spin on on the javelin for the Interiors
the exterior production wise is really a
case
of take what works on the H shaders and
the and and and the textures and whatnot
the model is always going to be unique
there's there's kind of nothing you can
do about that um but if I put the idress
next to the javelin like I say the the
key result that I'm after is that they
both look from the same Fleet they're
both from the same manufacturer uh and
and really the the production cycle of
the hris is pretty much the production
cycle of the javelin um they they both
go kind of hand in hand when when we
started the javelin it is the first
thing you have to do is the floor plan
we have to go through all the stuff that
we need so you got the gravity Drive the
reactors mes hle Barracks um you have to
kind of think about these things from
the ground up when you when you're
planning the interior layout of the ship
and what I'm really pleased about with
the javelin is we we managed to get
three concise decks um kind of planned
out so if you look at the ship from the
side the lower decks are engineering and
so and is kind of very hot and and
sweaty and a a workman's kind of place
right and then you hit the mid deck
which is habitation uh and that's again
it's no mistake you kind of first class
on a boing is up front there's no engine
noise and stuff the the middle of the
javelin theoretically would be the
quietest area of of the ship um so
that's all kind of laid out correctly
and then you go to the top deck which is
the technical area so You' probably
heard me talk about like the arch types
before um which is technical engineering
uh habitation and medical um if you look
at any any kind of section of the
javelin from any angle you can see clear
concise um uh breakouts of of those of
those archetypes they've all got their
place like an architect designed it
properly right um and that's what you
get from the javelin which I'm I'm
really pleased about because it then it
means that you get this clear
concise cut between habitation between
engineering and between technical um
whereas you know some of the other ships
they kind of have fallen a bit where
you'll go from a technical area into a
habitation and back into a technical
area that doesn't happen on on on the
javelin it's it's extremely like per
deck if one section of ship gets damaged
or goes down it's very much like um a
huge cruise liner so if if that hle gets
hit it will shut itself down so we've
got these huge bulkheads with massive
doors um that kind of will will just go
okay you're out now shut down and then
it's up for the engineer to start
rerooting power the I just has this huge
hanger that kind of runs through the
center of the ship the the javelin
doesn't um it has like a very kind of
small almost like a a utility hanger um
for a drop ship it is cool though the
hanger the the best thing about the
hanger is the floor Dan ingeniously
designed it it pretty much kind of
becomes the door essentially you have to
land on a platform and then that
platform lowers in but that platform
when it's up is actually the doors quite
cleverly and when you're actually inside
the hanger and you see everything kind
of moving up from traffic control it's
pretty awesome so the main differences
between the Idis and and the javelin is
we've obviously got the hanger space uh
difference it doesn't really kind of
carry as many craft it's got It's not
got a same utility vehicle but it has
got an awful lot of Weaponry the whole
ship's pretty much kind of cak in
turrets um and we've done this really
cool thing uh on on the back of the ship
where the remote turrets that are
actually on a track system at the moment
when you're flying towards a ship you
kind of don't know if a turret's in
operation or not um unless it kind of
goes down inside the hole or something
like that and and not a lot of our
remote turrets do that and but what we
done is we put the whole turret on a
track system so when they're not
manned they rotate back and go to the
back of the ship between the thrusters
so they're in the most shielded area
when they're not being used um but that
way as a player when you're approaching
one of these things you know if it's uh
if it's got his turrets up in defense or
not these huge things have gone way past
just being a very pretty asset in space
they're they're they're completely
functional uh and they're also kind of
extremely kind of fun to run around and
have have a shootout so my background is
FPS multiplayer maps I run round ships
looking at kind of gameplay um and how
you can make interesting gun play and
all that kind of stuff and and making
sure the level's balanced on the ship
production side of things we got to keep
quite a few people happy so obviously
there's the backers who who you know
they without them none of this would
happen so we have to kind of take their
feed back on board we done the Big Guns
trailer back in November I think it was
it was for yeah forzen con um um or
around about that time the ship has gone
through a couple of design changes on
the exterior since it first went out
simply because in the UK we have a habit
of making things bigger um which has a
domino effect to everything is is
certainly the case uh on this there was
a specific shot in that video that i'
done and um sorry Toby done that one
actually and um it showed the it showed
the bridge and of course there's a
crossbar across the bridge and and it
kind of was blocking the captain's view
If he if he would have to get to a
certain point in the bridge to kind of
see so we saw that we saw the feedback
on the forums and and we've gone back
and and remedied that and we taken that
as an opportunity then to actually kind
of generally just make the ship's Bridge
kind of feel a lot more kind of tangible
a lot better um and we've also got the
cut scenes going in now um for that
stuff for squadron so with hanis and
myself we're looking at it and how we
can flood as much kind of natural light
into these areas so there's some very
kind of cool windows that are turning up
um and and the javelin is actually kind
of far more so than than the Idis as as
far more exterior views throughout the
whole ship I've actually put a quite a
significant amount of man hours uh into
it not myself but we focus has shifted
onto it cuz we're at the point now where
I I pretty much kind of want to support
design for the Squadron 42 side of
things and for us to be able to do that
the ship needs to be at a certain kind
of Point okay cu the the javelin plays
an integral role um for a uh a part of
Squadron which I can't talk go out but
yeah it's it's pretty cool we have to
work with the writers on a daily basis
uh it's never as black and white as the
writers will you know kind of write
something we make it it's it's very much
a kind of a 50/50 thing there's a lot of
backwards and forwards so you know we
may end up kind of blocking out a new
area and then that that may kind of feed
back into the the script somehow and
into into you know the writers doing
something far more creative than what
what I would originally have kind of
thought about but it also works the
other way so the writers you know
they'll come up with ideas that feed our
our
inspiration this is where it gets really
kind of complicated so from from an art
production side of things we we hand the
ship off to Tech Design Tech design are
then going to go and do their pass with
obviously the balancing of the weapons
the balancing of the thrusters the
maneuverable thrusters but then also
with with this as as I mentioned it
plays an integral role in Squadron so
the design team on on Squadron uh are
also kind of expecting a certain version
of it um which we need to which we need
to produce as well off the back of the
Pu version that that just put together
it's just this kind of thing about kind
of make making a game or making making
an IP or or anything along that lines in
this industry is just just it's a very
human thing um that takes a lot of
people from a lot of different
disciplines to kind of get on and work
together and that's just a real kind of
small part of that it's challenging but
it's but it's it's massively use
[Music]
them it's great that the ship artists
were able to take what they learned from
the Idris and apply it to the javelin
very cool and while still giving the
javelin its own identity and that's all
