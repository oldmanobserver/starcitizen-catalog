hey everyone welcome to bug Smashers I'm
your host Mark aent I'm the gameplay
programmer here at cig Los Angeles and
I'm here to show you behind the scenes
of some bugs and how we smash them let's
take a look
box
[Music]
bashes hey everyone we're here in my
fancy dcy test level and we have a fun
UI problem with the Moi glass as you can
see I always use a weird screen
resolution and it always tends to make
the HUD go funky dunky you can kind of
see it with the visor right now and when
you pop up the mobiglass uh as you can
see you the edges tend to get offset and
cut
um if I my resolution was a little bit
wider I'd be able to see the actual
extent of the Mobi glass uh so the UI
guys were like well we can't have this
we needed to work on well pretty much
all resolution so that it scales
correctly on the screen and so that's
what the good old UI folks in UK office
has done um so here is our original code
uh for our mobiglass instance and we
have a standard scale that the designer
set up um which for on sense purposes
worked for the scale that they were
working in in their resolution however
it doesn't work in this crazy resolution
that I have of 1280 by 960 because I'm
weird I like to see my code on my left
and right side and it causes all sorts
of fun problems such as this uh
resolution Shenanigans so what the UI
guys have done is based on the renderer
um resolution or aspect uh they will
scale it so it will scale down or up
depending upon how crazy your screen
width and hiar uh so let's activate that
code to see what
happens bam so we take our original
scale uh we get the rendering and we
scale it based on the renderer width and
height so that um if the aspect is
slightly wider or slightly uh taller it
will try to focus it more onto the
center of the screen
all right let's hit the magic recode
button and see what that
does all right as you can see recod is
finished and our scaling has worked
pretty nicely in my crazy resolution it
actually shrinks it down so that I can
see the whole thing of U Mobi glass and
the only other problem that um exists is
here's the close button and as you can
see it's not highlighting because I have
to move it down bit where is it where is
it somewhere around
here there it is so as you can see
there's quite a big offset from here to
here um let's see what they did to fix
that so here in Flash UI element this is
where it takes the mouse input and sends
it off to our flash elements um in this
specific region of code it's getting our
Mouse coordinates and it's getting the
viewport of the renderer and The Flash
and it's trying to um see where it
should send the mouse inputs as you can
see we have for our X and Y we're taking
account the width and the height we're
not taking in account the viewport
offset which is the X and the Y
so if that button was at 0 0 way up on
the top we'd be able to click it because
there was no XY offset however we have
an X Andy offset um for where we are to
where this button is and we're not
taking of that offset so let's do that
and see what
happens this recode should go by pretty
quickly but if we have a little box and
we have another let say here we go box
and we have another like we could use
that square here um our Mouse input for
that POS we should say for this position
is going to be this x off
set and that will be that position for
this position right here it's going to
be this x offset plus this size and what
this code was doing was just taking
count this position and not this offset
so we do both of these and now we can
click here all right recode has been
done and we should be able to voila
click on the magical button so now
everything scales correctly and I can
click on buttons as you would expect
because well we're taking into account
all the
offsets hope you guys enjoyed woo so
today's bug was something to do with the
Mobi glass you know you pop it up and oh
no if you have a crazy resolution the
Mobi glass right in your face and you
can't see on this side or this side
because it's clipping or it's like
really really really small um it was
just a issue with not you know scaling
the thing based on your resolution so
the good old U UI programmers uh in the
UK uh made it so that it scales
depending upon your resolution and now
it looks pretty great uh you if you do
some crazy high resolution or some low
resolution and it's not all open in your
face or really really tiny and then the
other thing that they fixed was they had
a little button and if you clicked on
the button it wouldn't you know work
because it was actually offset and it
was just a small little thing to take in
account the position change of the uh
flash so that it offset correctly so
when you hit the button it's actually
right here instead of down here hope you
guys enjoyed until next time thank you
for watching so if you want to keep it
with a latest and greatest and Star
