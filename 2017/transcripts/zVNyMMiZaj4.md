hey everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host mark abent and I'm here to
take you behind the scenes on the
shenanigans called bugs everyone we are
here and blinking legs for that I am
going to disable lights not to distract
me now we look like a ps2 game excellent
so we are in a fun real production map
that is a dying star and I disabled
lighting because I don't like blinking
and we have a bug here where sometimes
when I get into a map I can't move
and this is the case of the non moveable
ships so let's step into John
Pritchett's fun is CF code and figure
out what's going on we the best part is
sometimes when I respawn
it works sometimes it doesn't alright so
here we are we have two ajaan systems we
have the flight controller which is
actual ifvs this dictates how the
spaceship should move then we have this
thruster manager which tells us yes hey
I have all these thrusters all over this
is how they move which is the
acceleration velocity and this could
change dynamically in case they get
detached or if they get damaged so you
have these two systems working in pair
so this thruster manager is basically
responsible for letting the flight
control system know how much thrust is
able to be done by the whole ship and I
put a breakpoint on this fun little bad
boy this tells what the maximum thrust
of the whole system is
and unfortunately we have this thing
called a physics state which John uses
to determine the overall physical
objects so we have this rigid body which
has mass it has speed and has
acceleration and it has a bunch of
thrust errs on it and what this guy does
is the thruster manager says hey I have
all these thrusters here and they can
move this way this way this way
so if the ifcs can move this guy a
certain way based on input and move and
fire off the thrusters so the thruster
manager needs to know a few bits such as
the mass of this thing to figure out its
acceleration and unfortunately the civic
status that the thruster manager sees is
all basically zeroed out so according to
the thruster manner this thing has no
mass so it's going to say that all the
thrusters are basically not going to be
able to use any acceleration or provide
any acceleration on a zero mass object
because from the standpoint of the game
general mass means static and this just
going to stay it you can't have zero
mass on a thing so this lovely thing is
going to basically return let's step
back put a breakpoint actually right
here
and as you can see our acceleration for
the whole system is going to be zero so
I can never ever move the joys
so let's find out when this M status is
set so it's set this is a some debug
thing and it's never going to get hit
obviously cuz we never hit the
breakpoint and tuning so here's
something where the thruster manager
went in updates its going to capture the
civic state of the flight controller so
put up the breakpoint there and fought
off the breakpoint here and let's
continue so we get down begin update and
we have actual information key point
here we have two updates we have the
physics update and then we have the main
update the physics update happens in the
Civic system so that it can do its
physical calculations and we have a main
update which is game code specific on
how it should provide stop to the
physics so in this specific area this is
the physics update as you can see we
have we're getting our physics
information correctly cool let's disable
that continue to now we get to the main
update and as you can see we have
invalid information so where does this
happen in the flight controller so the
flight controller let's go back this is
M status so we have the physics status
and we have to discuss four main this
will guy works this guy's broken let's
find out when this gets updated this
gets updated in
this is very specific code for track
view so it won't get the hit in here
this gets called on tuning debug feature
won't get called
and this gets caught out here we go so
here's our update main and before way
down here we actually update the
thrusters to figure out the new
acceleration it's supposed to set the
main physics information however it'll
bet you do debug all things aha so what
this tells us is the flight controller
has this variable called n animation
mode and because it's true we're never
updating the Civic status so thrusters
can never figure out their valid
acceleration this is fun because this is
supposed to be for track view that was
that value we saw way up at the top
which doesn't get hit this should never
be true so let's find out this only gets
true when we enter track view
information this is not going to hit
because we're not in a cinematic
sequence and that's the only spot
alright let's find out in the code where
all this gets set so nowhere does it
ever set it except in your track view
and in here
ah-ha so what's happening is in C++ if
you never give this guy an initial value
it will be random it will be whatever
the memory is in there and as you can
tell from this break point
it says true followed by a four what
that means is we didn't actually set
this to a boolean true we set this to
true because it had some random data in
this memory block so what we have to do
for the stick is make sure that we start
off false and to validate that we are
going to in memory start it false now
from then on it will calculate the
correct information we continue to do we
are now getting correct acceleration and
I should be able to fly should I am so
all it was was just a simple
uninitialized variable causing havoc on
the system globally the joys of C++ you
have to be very very careful one
variable could cause destruction and the
whole wiser so zip just adding this will
fix it and we no longer will get that
random this guy works in this machine it
doesn't work on this machine there you
go hope you guys enjoy so as you guys
saw we had one awesome uninitialized
variable where sometimes it was true
sometimes it was fault it was pure
random and that caused havoc because on
my machine that might work on someone
else's machine it wouldn't work and it's
just disrupted the flow of John's IFES
system just making sure that was
predefined fixed all the issues so when
you hop into a multiplayer at work top
and single-player it worked
and in that fun track view it worked as
intended hope you guys enjoy until next
time thank you for watching so if you
want to keep it with the latest and
greatest in star citizen and squadron 42
development please follow us on our
social media channels see you soon
