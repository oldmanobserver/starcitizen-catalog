hello and welcome to around the verse
our weekly look at the development of
star citizen I'm sandy gardner and i'm
chris roberts it is great to have you
back in LA office truth
yes it's back a little bit of jet lag
but i just returned from about a month
over in europe at our foundry 42 offices
in Germany and the UK and we could sit
down with both teams to work through the
various aspects of 3.0 and squadron 40
which were very hard at work on you can
find out exactly what all of our
officers have been up to by readings
made monthly report which we're
releasing tomorrow yeah and to tide you
over until then here's an account of an
update from our UK office which I think
you'll enjoy
hi everyone my name is Nick Elms and I'm
the creative director here at foundry 42
in the Wilms office in the UK Aaron is
on holiday this week so it's up to me to
give you this month's studio update as
you would imagine the Wilms office is
still a hive of activity with tasks bugs
and features all being worked on to both
squadron 42 and 3.0 let's start with the
ongoing Sprint's with the air traffic
controller sprint the initial groundwork
has now been completed and we're moving
on to more of the functionality
including communicating with the ATC
from your cockpit when you want to land
you now target the station using the
player interaction system select the
option to request a landing then you'll
be given the start of a communications
channel with the NPC to have a dialogue
with them
we're currently in the process of
implementing this in real-world cases so
for example in RP you map we are setting
up a port olisar so both requesting your
ship as well as landing will all go
through the ATC as part of the push to
make starter system more accessible
we're introducing a new hint system to
make the initial learning curve lower
for new players as the player begins
their first steps into the spouse's
in-universe various hints will get
displayed on the UI giving feedback on
how to interact with the different
systems whether it's entering the
proximity of the a SOP terminal or
letting them know about a movi glass
feature after a given amount of time
43.0 we're changing how the player
spawns into the level currently this is
done by spawn points so these bedroom in
the pu map has its own spawn point and
then some flow graph logic to position
them correctly in the bed and play the
correct animation as you will imagine
with a number of spawn locations and the
PU issues adding up to a lot of flow
graph and setup going forwards we're
creating a new spawn component which can
be added to any entity for example if
this component is added to a bed we will
then assume the player will need to be
attached correctly to it and play the
normal lie down idle animation
automatically this now means that we can
remove a large amount of flow graph and
simplify the setup of the level work is
continuing for the missions on 3.0 with
the progress on the implementation of
the mission broker and mission manager
these will determine how a mission and
all its objectives are presented to and
given to the player to complete they
will also be tracking what missions a
player who already has and how far
through the objectives they are in the
AAA locomotion sprint we are spending
time refining the way the AI walks and
runs around a level we have found that
just following a path which is
determined by the path finding code
gives a result which looks very
unnatural we're now implemented a new
path smoothing algorithm which makes AI
traversal around corners in a much more
natural way so it doesn't look like
they're going from one point to the next
because they're generally moving to get
to a particular place we're currently
working on making reaching that point
and going into whatever animation is
required to be as seamless as possible
the graphics team have been wrapping up
and bug-fixing the major features
mentioned in our last last update such
as lip fog real-time environment probes
planet lighting and render to texture
work Holograms and video comms in
addition they've made some tweaks to our
lighting model to improve the appearance
of ground reflections of the Sun on
planets at sunset and sunrise the u.k
animation team has continued to work on
the FPS weapons with the previous
complete for the new gemini l86
ballistic pistol the arrowhead is now
close to final with just some minor
polish work left on the reload States
the take downs have gone from an
implementation pass to a more refined
animation pass with concentration on a
stronger composition solid posing clear
silhouettes and polish to the mocap data
to better sell the overall action the AI
animation work is ongoing with
improvements to the posing of enemy
Patrol States and reactions to sight and
sound the team are also helping to
export the remaining gameplay story
cinematic scenes so that design can
implement and better visualize the story
within the levels they're working on the
Derby animation team are finishing off
the facial animations for the 3.0
mission givers and Eckart's body
animation is being polished and
implemented to last week some of the
team attended a PU audio and facial
shoot in London they captured some
awesome footage from some great actors
and we think it will go a long way to
flesh it out the universe the VFX team
have continued tests with a new lighting
entity this time focusing on smaller
scale interior electrical effects they
have also been testing the features in
the new particle system as provided by
the graphics team including better
trailer options and depth buffer based
collision required for sparks for
example the first low-key exterior VFX
passes under way including refinery
flames and general ambience the new
cutlass flight-ready VFX
including interior damage and thruster
effects are now done work has continued
on the atmospheric flight effects print
with heavy focus on play testing book
fixing and testing new features has
provided by the graphics and engineering
teams the ongoing polish for the VFX for
the new weapons and rework versions is
continuing up to the 3.0 release on the
outside the origin 600 I concept process
has now finished and we're really
looking forward to seeing what you guys
think it's one sleek ship the next
ground vehicle has been rocking along
and we're just about to kick off a whole
new round of ships on the ship weapons
front we've taken the Klaus and Lerner
styling from the FPS weapons and use
that to influence the work on the Klaus
and Verner laser Peter on the other end
of the spectrum we're looking at some
cool looking Max ox neutron repeaters
the art team has also been hammering
away at further Shubin mining station
interiors working out a few more areas
to improve on for its believability this
is done by zero in on the functionality
of the area's work has also continued on
providing further infrastructure to the
habitation pods including comms arrays
water collectors and small deployable
communication units our space scenes
have been
in a major facelift for the 3.0 release
we've been very busy adding large
volumes of interplanetary space dust
within the stanton system adding texture
and visual interest to our space
overworld has been a big priority for
the 3.0 release as part of this sprint
we've reworked some of the distant
nebula in the stanton system but there's
still lots more to come we've been
working on large-scale nebulae rendering
techniques using the pyro system as a
test case these techniques will help us
create our interstellar scale nebula
also for squadron 42 we're exploring the
look and feel of the coil which plays a
major role in the first campaign we're
using powerful fluid simulations to help
us achieve this look any work we
undertake on improving the space 43.0 as
always is a great benefit for squadron
42 work is ongoing for the truck stop
station materials this includes
finalizing the panel shapes adding some
hue and gloss variation and elements of
wear and tear and dirt the unclogged
frames also being finalized with
structural elements surrounding the
machinery and high-frequency detail we
have continued to work on the solar
panels trying different ideas out and
getting them to a stage where they gel
well with the rest of the truck stop the
rest of the truck stop team are
finalizing the main hall pieces before
proceeding to the front and back
sections of the station special
consideration is being made to ensure
all pieces of work as well as the
modular set don't look visually
repetitive detail layer areas around the
landing pad is ongoing and this includes
adding more visual complexity to the
back of the landing pad as well as the
borders around the edge of the pad in
relation to the surface outpost more of
the archetypal outposts have had a
dressing and the lighting paths this
includes an emergency shelter which can
be found dotted around the moons as a
place for crash pilots to take refuge
also an illegal drug lab which may or
may not be on one of the moons planet
integration materials for the outpost
exterior have been tested and tweaked
for sand and ice biomes this determines
the amount of dirt build-up that can
vary for each biome and can be adjusted
for each outpost for variation branding
prototyping has been explored for
procedure locations with the ray re
brand as a test case this includes the
main logos and text along with the
secondary logos indents lines and
signage this would procedurally swap
brands depending on who owns the outpost
with regard to the ship team the
reclaimer work has been completed on the
drone
we're keen to focus on the drone
deployment and storage mechanism as
we're excited to see this become
functional when drones come online the
engine room has also been completed
making use of repurposed assets from the
idris all reused assets go through the
process of reskin with reclaimer
materials to make everything feel
consistent and cohesive the exterior
damage setup is nearing completion with
internal geometry being built to be
exposed when the ship takes damage work
on the derelict ships and wreckage
elements are coming to an end for the
initial batch and support is now in
place for design to create mission
scenarios based on derelict ships in
space or on planets the material
variations of each ship have been
created so that depending on which
planet the ships are placed on they will
look visually embedded to the surface
type
[Music]
[Music]
all its remaining for this phase are the
technical elements such as LEDs these
areas and collisions the Gladius cockpit
has been revamped and relit for the new
cockpit experience spring this has been
an exercise in improving the players
feeling of immersion and has been a
collaboration between several
departments on the outside it's been
achieved by clearing a channel between
the top support screens to reveal the
Gatling gun on the nose and making a
range of interactive buttons for more
interesting animations and remodeling
the throttle for improved functionality
the cockpit canopy has been extended for
a better clarity and new interior
lighting has been added to help bring it
all to life
on the whole see exterior work is
currently being done on finishing the
landing gear mechanisms and detailing
the inner Bay Area's while we create the
initial animations and work towards a
final art the front section of the
interior is now modeling complete and is
getting a detailed lighting pass using
new light groups controller once this is
complete the tunnel section and rear
engine room will be modeled and lit in
the same fashion
[Music]
the live design team are plowing ahead
with content for the PU and they've made
sure to spend a bit of time giving
much-needed love to some of the existing
arena commander of star Marine maps
Gangstar has received a new lease of
life with the addition of procedural
asteroids which give a much more
cinematic dogfighting experience both of
the star Marine maps have received a
number of balancing changes based on
feedback from the community in Echo xi
we've made some adjustments to the
capture points and in last and and
damien we've added a sneaking uva route
from the Marine spawn zone to landing
pad be on the UI front we've been busy
chipping away all the various features
that are making their way into the new
MOBA class we've made progress on
getting the home screen fully functional
and displaying elements of the active
status atmosphere readouts suit status
readouts as well as personal overview
we've also got player loadout management
working as an app in mobile us this
interface should easily carry over to
handle ship loadout customization as
well as is currently in the arena
commander for an end menu we're also
working to get mote the mobi glass UI in
general to be projected using the new
render to texture tech which will make
the UI looks much more properly
integrated within the game world workers
continued on designing and implementing
the upcoming character customization
menu on the front end which will be
included in 3.0 from here players will
be able to create and customize their
various characters and the pu obviously
depending on how many character slots
that player has initially the level of
customization will be limited where
you'll be expanded in the future to
provide much more granular control of
characters features the audio team has
been working on several features for the
3.0 release these include the procedural
planet ambience system which is designed
to place appropriate sounds around the
player dynamically as they traverse
planetary bodies
we've also been refining the approach on
how we produce ship armaments and
first-person weapon audio further
ensuring they're satisfying to the
player by reflecting player-driven
modifications and customization this
example I'm gonna show you today is for
the bearing size 2 laser cannon we've
basically changed the sound to a kind of
new more exciting big sound using our
new system which I'll explain so this is
what the new sound is like
so as you can hear it's basically yeah a
lot bigger a lot punchier a lot more
kind of pronounced the audio team has
been producing sound schemes for the
different kinds of diegetic user
interfaces that will feature in 3.0
including the kiosks the audio direction
of these very to suit their technical
and this presents some great
opportunities to reinforce they're
looking for preparations begun in
earnest for a Foley session at Pinewood
Studios to ensure audio coverage for
character clothing and armor and content
to extend the footstep system further
progress has also been made on the
foundational audio tech such as dynamic
Bank loading the active status system
the audio propagation system and music
logic system as well as content
production for derelict ships bespoke
3.0 location sound design ship damage
effects audio support ship improvements
and more besides we're really excited
about all the new content and gameplay
that 3.0 will bring and as you can see
from what's been going on here we're
getting closer every day all remains for
the UK update is to send out a message
thank you to you our backers without
which we would not be able to put
together this amazing game see you in
the verse placing procedural asteroids
into arena commander should add a fun
new wrinkle to dogfighting ya know it's
actually great to see the new technology
when building the 3.0 and beyond
actually make all the aspects of the
game better and handsome and also it's
also cool to see one of the new stuff
that we're working on that was in the
report like the space you know the space
Rex on the moons and we'll have land
space can be really kind of fun to
discover and explore very cool one of
the biggest upgrades coming to the game
is item 2.0 on last week's episode we
use ships to explore how this system
opens a whole new world of possibilities
for star citizen yeah that's right so
when it comes to ships allows for
softball components ties into the new
interaction system and even upgrades the
seats and conference place making that
the
aspect of flying and controlling or
using a ship much more tactile and
visceral which is being sort of goal or
started in essence beginning for more on
this here is part two of our feature on
how item 2.0 is changing the way you'll
play the game last week we spoke about
the incredibly important migration of
all our ships to the item 2.0 technique
today I want to describe some of the
challenges we faced we had B seats and
the seats are pretty nifty they allow me
to enter exit' and do some basic things
but there are only four vehicles they're
part of the vehicle logic so one of the
stepping stones before we got the 2.0
was to turn that seat into more of a
generic system it was kind of like the
in between the vehicle and then 2.0
system and what that allowed us to do
was to separate these seats into
individual items to do email your enter
exits so we started porting stuff over
to that system and we came across some
problems that the original system solved
but the new system didn't say we have a
single theater fighter and we opened up
the canopy and then the ladder and then
you walk up and you enter it now with
the original vehicle seats you can do
that there there are these things called
post actions and I think pre actions
basically we play an animation to open
those gateways and then the player can
enter the entrance and everything in
close problem is with that one point oh
the new seats is you couldn't actually
talk to the vehicle to play those things
but you could play an animation on
itself
so these 1.0 seats were mostly used for
things like the multi-crew ships where
you didn't have to play those animations
on the ship you just need to play it on
the seat so you needed like the
retaliate er has this dashboard so you
you interact with it and do stuff that
was all separated of the vehicle but if
you needed to still play those animation
vehicle you had to go back to vehicle
seats so what that led us to do is now
we have two different seats they solve
two different problems and what we want
to do was remove these two seats and go
with a 2.0 version that solved both of
these issues what we had to come up with
was we needed a seat and this thing
called a seat dashboard and then the
seat access the seat is only responsible
for just plopping the player down and
giving him control the seat by itself
doesn't do anything then you have the
dashboard this is basically that
infrastructure you see in front of you
that shows the UI shows this shows the
joysticks and you have the seat access
which dictated how you got into that
seat now we can do all that which is
fine however we needed to brake as you
can see we now have three different
items where those other original things
just pad like the vehicle seat to Ted it
just on the ship so now we have to break
out all of these assets and put them
into different items we have to break
out all of the animations into the
different states yes the system allows
us to do a lot more it allows us to do
things that's some of the animation team
want to do but because of the way the
old vehicle seats and item seats were
designed we had to go back and revisit
how we did those change the art change
the whole process take our animations
cut them up in different ways just to
get them onto the 2.0 infrastructure so
it's like the stuff we want to do way
back then we couldn't do so we kind of
had to do some fake a route but because
of that fakery we had to go back cut
them up to how we actually wanted to do
it finally after you know this is stuff
we've been talking about animation
design for a long time it's just an
extra step we have to do to move
everything over that's one of the
reasons why it's taking a little bit we
actually have a big master plan of
moving all the ships over and it's like
all right before we can move this guy
over we have to cut that animation up
from here to here to here move this here
move this here okay does it work as
we're doing that ship by ship by ship
and of course all of our ships are very
special snowflakes they'll do something
a little bit different here so we have
to reach since we we have a defined plan
of how this new setup is going to work
we just have to figure out how that's
going to get cut up correctly so that
works with the new infrastructure one of
the precautions we're now taking with
all the new ships is learning the
problems that we did the past of what
this ship is doing wrong or different
that's causing havoc a very beautiful
ship that's causing us some fun is the
gladiator you
have two seats on the top and then you
have a Bombay door on the bottom and you
have this line that has to come down to
allow either one of them the original
thing wanted both the seats to come down
so if I'm piling the ship and my
co-pilot want to get out I have to come
out with him luckily we're able to split
that up so that type comes down then
either one to come but you still have
the problem that Bombay door because
that's part of the landing system and
the seat system which is two different
seats connections that don't know about
each other and the old system didn't
really handle that too well but now I'm
in 2.0 we're going okay you can't leave
until that Bombay is open so we're going
to open that first then you could come
down then the seats could go back up so
we have like systems in place but ships
or special cupcakes and we're going to
make sure that they work on this new
flow when we're splitting up the ship
from moving the vehicle from being the
seat to this kind of sub hybrid thing
called the 1.0 seats we had this thing
called a seat hose and the seat host was
basically kind to trying to remove that
bit of logic of seat from the ship to a
generic thing and it was like your very
beginning sort of structure it was kind
of a weird mixture of things the idea
for that thing so that fecal turret
generic stuff could use this have seats
but because of that a lot of things
started using this thing called a seat
host so you had things in the player
code checking to see if there's if
you're attached to an IC test you had
things in UI checking to see if you're
ni seat us she had a lot of these
embedded things checking for this thing
called an IC to us which was horrible
but it was the only way to get stuff
going until we separated these things
into components we now have to take
those things that we lied on the C toast
and make them more into a more generic
thing one of the biggest challenges is
going to be of course the UI things like
the visor relied heavily on the seat
host things you pull event the pull
information out of you know these events
will get dispatched when you know I my
ship again this guy starts firing this
guy you I will listen to it and it has
to go oh I'm not the guy shooting so I'm
going to ignore this block but not
everywhere did that so you have the UI
listening to all these crazy events and
it had to rely on this thing called a
seed host but if the seed has
disappeared and in the registry crashing
all sorts of problems we came up with
this new infrastructure for the UI for
the seats where they relied on more of
the item components themselves rather
than the seat level and what this
allowed us to do was worry about just
the item so you would have a UI for
power it just relied on knowing about
the power plant didn't care about the
vehicle didn't care about the player was
attached to and the beauty of that is I
could technically slap this arm to a a
big bending machine that the power plan
you can see its power coming but that
was the dream and separating that UI
bits and pieces is one of the biggest
overhauls we had to do not just for UI
but than all the other sections of the
code and we're still dealing with it
because we're at a point where we have
to maintain both the admin 1.0 and the
atom 2.0 until we could fully flip the
switch saying one point I was not
supported so you have some new UI with
that seat host some UI with just the
power and it's kind of that weird thing
you're trying to deal with to not break
the old until everything you get
switched over to the new system one of
the other big architectural changes
we've been working on is going back to
the vehicle if we had items on here we
have this thing called an vent system
that sensitive nth to the vehicle and
that would dispatch it to everybody else
but since we want to get away with that
vent system for one everyone knows about
it and to it was immediate and it was on
the main thread what that meant is if I
sent it event and I sent it to everybody
the main thread basically has to wait
until everyone got it they all did their
update and then everything happened
instantaneous so radar picked up some
enemy census events saying this thing
was added the UI would get it but to
create all these resources just to
display a lot of things would happen
when one event gets dispatched so one of
the things that we changed is instead of
having
immediate call the vent system we have
this thing called a multi-threaded event
system and instead of everybody
connecting to the vehicle's event system
they have their own and they can link to
each other so now if you I want to know
about radars getting uh you know stuff
appearing on the radar you can listen to
this thing called the radar data bank
and the radar data bank when it picked
up something from the radar the radar
would send an event to the data bank the
data bank wouldn't process it right then
and there
it would process it in that batch update
that I was talking about during its own
time hold the events out do its thing
and handle that big load onto that
thread and then when it would do some it
would then dispatch events to other
system then they would do that same very
thing so we've just offloaded this heavy
system into batches and also allows us
to guarantee that when this guy sent the
event the other guy would pull it down
when he was ready not immediately
occurring and with that nice event
system we could actually do some nifty
things where we could actually localize
those events so before I was saying we
have the we separated the person who
controls stuff from the actor to this
thing called an item user the item user
has these main events we call them input
events and he has an input in an output
event system he could get inputs from
all sorts of things and he could send
off outputs so if I press a button he
might go oh I need to turn on lights
he'll translate that to an out event
system he will dispatch to all the items
heat they control but they'll only pull
it down when they're ready to so the
player hits a button and maybe switch on
light the switch on light gets sent to
an event to get it finds the controllers
that he controls figures out oh this guy
needs to have it cured this event that
light controller will pull the event
down in its batch update go ok I need to
turn on lights so I'm going to go
through all my lights send them an event
saying hey go turn on they'll go in
their batch update and go oh I should be
on or off
I'm going to turn off off on whatever
button you hit so now we've moved this
thing that with a global thing on the
vehicle so I send the event here and
there everyone gets it to
a more localized system that all gets
usually utilizing that batch update and
the whole big infrastructure of our
controllers and items this other thing
that we have with this item 2.0
infrastructure with their old system
with their vehicle when I sat down in
the seat I would get control of weapons
items and all that stuff and each thing
would kind of handle their own set of
logic I'm in the fire button to shoot
and then you would it would do its thing
and shoot we wanted to separate that
into a much more coherent structure and
so after talking with design we came up
this this new concept where you have the
control manager which is the ship and
then you have the user and then the user
connects to the control manager and he
controls these things called literally
controllers so you'd have a power
controller a light controller a door
controller basically these are the
things that have control of sub-items so
the controllers handled the input and
then they sell things to the items it
means you want to power controller so
this power controller might have control
of sub power plants it will talk to you
I saying here's all the power plants
that you have what do you want to do
with them so if I hit UI or maybe a
button to throttle it's an event to the
control that controller will go yes you
could do that no you can't do that and
it will then tell the items to do
something so now we basically we have
these sub items that are really kind of
dummy that handles very specific logic
what power plan just needs to provide X
amount of power and then you have the
energy controller that basically input
from UI and input from the user and it
translates what you want to do to those
sub items so we have these very specific
things that handle the I guess to be
called the control hierarchy is ash said
and last week's episode although it's a
lot of work to implement this tech it is
a game changers every sense of the word
item 2.0 touches every facet of the game
and will ultimately create a much more
immersive interactive experience thanks
for watching Seacrest out
so as you can see item 2.0 not only
allows it to implement new features but
also streamline others it's obviously a
lot of work but will provide a much more
immersive experience and
you know much I like the motion you do
that's it for this episode of around the
birds just a reminder that we'll be
updating spectrum tomorrow so it will be
offline for about half an hour to 11:00
a.m. Pacific now make sure to swing by
after that to check out all of the new
features yeah they're pretty cool you
see threads with different view styles
and all the rest of stuff and also don't
forget Mason see report goes live
tomorrow along with another update to
our production schedule thanks as always
to all of our subscribers whose
continued support makes shows like this
possible click on the link in the
description if you want to learn how to
become a subscriber yep thank you to all
subscribers and of course star citizen
it's a reality because of the amazing
support we get from all backers so
thanks to everyone who's making the game
possible we hope you enjoyed watching
and we will see you around
