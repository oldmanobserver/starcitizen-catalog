## Transcript

hello everybody welcome to another
episode of star citizen live outer space
interface
because i'm a sucker for the rhyming
titles i'm your host jared huckabee and
if you've never seen star citizen live
before well it's a about it's where we
take about an hour out of the end of our
week and we chat with some of our many
developers we discuss their work uh
their efforts on the project uh
sometimes we take questions from you the
star citizen community other times we
watch them work as they develop
something live in front of everybody
on this week's show we have two members
of our steamed ui team let's meet them
now let's see which button is that there
there we go
uh we have got ui director mr simon
burzy
hello nice to meet you jared
and we've and and we've got a principal
ui
a programmer mr david bonegill
hello jared how you doing i'm doing well
now we say you've heard me say bone
several times because throughout the
conference throughout the hour we're
probably we're gonna end up slipping and
referring to david as bone because
that's his nickname and every time we
have david on the sh on a show which is
not often but every time we have them
it's always it lends to some confusion
so for all those people who
aren't here at the beginning like
they're going to jump in in five minutes
10 minutes or the people who jump in 30
minutes into the show it's like what's
bone what are they talking about you all
in chat you all help us out you'll help
us out here and tell people who the heck
we're talking about here so they don't
think there's just this third person
missing on the camera
now
before we get started on this week's
show uh as we want to do let's let's
take a few minutes and uh find out who
you are and what you do because uh the
way ui works and it's developed in this
project is perhaps maybe a little bit
different that comes from our uh
building blocks thing it democratizes
the process and we'll get into that uh
but just so folks understand the kind of
scope of work and stuff sign actually
david why don't we start with you uh
what is your role in star citizen and
its ui development
oh okay well i
my role is
i'm primarily a programmer
but i'm like a
i think people call it systems architect
which is like a fancy name for
uh developing systems and i've been
developing the system
for the ui for for our game um we had
like the system that in place but it
wasn't really very um star citizeny um
it didn't really meet chris's standards
or it didn't meet a lot of the goals
that we're trying to do
um for this um
big project so about
three years ago chris was like right can
you make us something
that will get us to this position where
we can make ui for
all these different you um
all these different systems in the game
and
make it easier for
the designers to make ui make it easier
for the programmers like the gameplay
programmers to present their stuff so we
can make uis for them
things like that
and also bring in all these different
like new rendering techniques as well
because what we had before was kind of a
very
what people would call a traditional ui
like hey here's the game we just render
something over the top you know is a
number of lives or something in how many
bullets you've got but our game's quite
a lot different from that and obviously
it's
uh online a lot of the ui is in the
world so we're all looking at
the same screens in the world and stuff
like that so my job was to develop
technology that would help help us solve
a lot of those
problems along the way um a lot of new
problems that you don't really see in a
lot of games and some of them are just
like
big performance problems are big
um
there's just a lot of stuff in our game
so like trying to make it so good tools
so we can make things as quickly as
possible
um well it's right as quickly as
possible i think so
right yeah
you said i i made this you used the past
tense a few times but yeah this is these
are still tasks that are ongoing i mean
oh absolutely yes
it's it's i i i think it'll that this
will come up as a common thread
throughout the show and it's always
important to remember that
star citizen is still in alpha uh it it
it it
the ui the user interface all the
aspects of this are still in development
and you know
and still a work in progress so so
always keep that in your mind as we
discuss these things
simon you are the ui director
what is the ui director what what's your
day-to-day like
uh well i kind of wear many hats which i
guess is a phrase in here sometimes um i
suppose the actual
bit that ties the most to the title is
is my job to make sure that the
the ui in star citizen it's all kind of
pulling in the same direction so
we kind of have
consistency between the different areas
because it's a really big game we've got
lots of different teams working on ui or
bits of the ui so we we have to make
sure that it
feels like the same game essentially so
there's a certain amount of
rules for how stuff should work
associated with that and also there's
the visual side of things so um got to
make sure that i know say what the
active feature team is working on is
similar to what ui feature team is
working on so on across the company so
there's a there's a quite a lot of that
that's that's the main part of the job
um i also help to run the ui feature
team so i do a little bit of team lead
stuff there just kind of doing the
day-to-day making sure people are happy
and everything's planned out that kind
of thing
and
very rarely one thing i like to do is do
a bit of hands-on so i like to get in
there and do a bit of kind of technical
stuff build some ui
make it work
but a lot of the time it's it's talking
to other people and organizing things
and giving people feedback
now you said something interesting we're
going to jump into that with our next
question here uh working with other
teams like the actor feature team to
make sure
their uh the things that they've created
are in line with other things um unlike
uh i'm not gonna speak for every single
game and development but unlike many
other games out there uh
the ui team
does not build all of the ui in star
citizen uh we have created a system that
democratizes that process and puts the
power in the hands of system designers
on the actor feature team system
designers on the eupu feature team you
know yes systems designers on the
systemic services team uh stuff like
that we've put the power into the hands
of designers and all these other teams
to create
much or
most of their ui and then the ui team
kind of comes in and and you know shapes
adjusts you know conforms it to the to
fit the uh
the greater star citizen experience
and that's all through building blocks
uh how has the building blocks
technology developed in the last year i
mean we haven't really
dove deep into it since we had zayn on i
think that i think it was still atv
back then uh you know talking about so
how has it developed in the last year
and where would you like to see it go in
the future
so
i'll start there's plenty of things that
bone could say on this um but i think
the important thing for my side is that
we've
we've kind of we've rolled it out from
something that the ui you that this kind
of the core ui team used to use and and
we were kind of working out how to use
it as well it's got to a point now where
it's good enough for the rest of the
team to use so we kind of rolled it out
to
game designers across the company some
of the artists that kind of thing
um so
it kind of makes our jobs easier i
suppose because there's you know it's
not just
six people trying to get the ui done for
the whole company now
those particular teams can take control
and they can make their own kind of
demos and functional versions of stuff
so that's
that's a really big thing that it's
brought to us um
bones i'm sure bro could go a lot a lot
into the technical
things that have changed over the past
year as
over well
past year um
i think the thing well the thing the
major thing that we've been working on
like at the core tech level um would be
adding 3d
which
it's a big feature and it's
as soon as you jump from you know
drawing some texts and some images to
hey i want to be able to draw models i
want to be able to draw
characters vehicles and all these kind
of things as part of the ui scene
that's that things get pretty
complicated about so
we've been working on that um
that's part of the year um
so
that involves um
lighting for those models how the
materials look do you do holograms
um how do they appear in the ui do they
appear in a screen do they appear over a
screen do they appear without a screen
just sort of like you know if you can
have
hologram uis of floating letters and
ships and stuff like that so there's all
kinds of like
exciting rendering tech that we've been
involved in with that um
uh we've seen
that develop the i think the first thing
we've seen it in is the inventory which
we should be seeing
um and that was really really quite
complicated we have we show like 50
models at a time and each of those
individual models
has
its own scene its own camera it has
three lights um so there's just
thousands and thousands of little
objects we have to um manage all the
time so that's
that's what we've been doing
over the past year so as a core
technology group we develop that stuff
ready for the gameplay teams to use so
maybe
i'm hoping that we're in a space that
they start using it and then they
they'll develop their uis and hopefully
the players will get to see that in a
couple of releases time after that
because we're like right at the start of
that change so now is into a state that
the gameplay teams start to use it and
then they come back to me and say hey
it's not quite working correctly yet
and then i fix a few things and then
then they can start developing their
features with those kind of things
yeah as well as the 3d actually there's
put a lot more time into some reusable
pieces as well so when
maybe when bone did his talk before i
know zayn showed some restylable stuff
which is really cool but the actual
process to to do that was was pretty
complicated so if you wanted a button he
had to make it from a like a square
object and put some text on and all that
kind of thing and we've we've got a
system now which which means we can sort
of package those things up so if
somebody wants a button instead of
having to build it from all the pieces
they can just drag a button into their
scene and change the name on it
so we've added quite a few bits like
that so
it doesn't make a massive difference to
what people see at the end of the
process but for
like
less technical people game designers and
artists it's a lot easier for them to
just kind of build a screen out of
pieces
and also all those pieces are restylable
as well so
for example at the moment we've
we've just added a crusader style to the
game so if someone's already set up a
screen we can just turn it to crusader
and it will change colors and some of
the graphics will change and so on which
is it's kind of cool
you use the phrase less technical i it's
it it always amuses me because i think
there's a
perception
out there that exists you know in the
world of game developers that that all
game developers are also
master technicians yeah you know they've
all got degrees in computer science or
they all underst you know they all
understand the inner workings of of of
everything and the reality is that many
of these you know people you know
artists or whatever they come from very
specialized fields and so you know
building a tool set that
uh is user friendly for them is is is
essential in this um that takes me to my
next question you mentioned that
building blocks has made it
easier for you because because many of
the
uh basic fundamental ui elements are
actually created by our
system designers on these other teams
and not the ui team
and then you and then you mentioned
having to support
them like when they say oh this isn't
working or or this feature isn't working
quite doing what i wanted to do
whereas it makes it easier
for the creation has that
has that workload switched to support
are you now just as busy supporting
everybody how how often do you have to
clean up after the mess of
of uh of other teams
you know creating ui that just doesn't
work
well
go on then bone
well i i think clean cleanup um is
probably a
bit overdoing it but uh we definitely i
definitely get a lot of um
calls during like the release phase of
saying hey
i've made all this and it's not working
quite how i expect it to now
is that because
they've
implemented it wrong or is it because
maybe my stuff's wrong or our you know
the core tech
is wrong
um
so
trying to help them debug what what
what's going on and find out what the
problem
is i think that that's grown um but
that's a really good thing i can only
see that as like a
really positive step because we get
lots and lots of people contributing now
and being a support role is
um
a lot easier than what we used to do
which was having a really compressed
role at the end of the
release cycle which is all the gameplay
teams have finished their feature and
just go it just needs ui now can you
just make the ui for it and it just
needs ui now
uh yeah that
um
yeah that was really tricky because you
had to really get get involved in lots
of other people's work and understand
what they want then design it and write
the tech and the ui for it and and these
will all be completely individual
systems you'll be working on vehicles
one week and then you'll be working on
the mobi glass next week and they'll be
working on the front end and that was
really difficult
you'd get these
jack of all trades master of none
because who like diving in and out but
they were all equally very important at
the same time
but now that that's spread out and
offering support is a lot easier because
i'm supporting them in a role
where
i know the tech and i can
i can give advice about the stuff that's
going on
and also
can hopefully write tools to help them
debug their own stuff as well
yeah well one thing that's interesting
is it like
with ui and games
with ai on games you get this thing
called emergent behavior where the game
starts doing stuff that you didn't
expect
we almost have a similar thing with the
the ui tool where it's not it's not ai
that's doing it but we'll we'll make it
decided to do a particular thing then we
hand it over to people to actually use
and they come up with all these crazy
ways of using it that we never expected
so
they usually doing really cool stuff but
sometimes i suppose there's two sides to
it sometimes
we'll get something that works really
well and then we'll look at the the file
that's been made to construct it and
it's like spaghetti there's just
connections everywhere
um
so we sometimes go in and kind of tidy
that up a bit and
let them know here's another way you
could do it that's going to be a bit
more efficient that kind of thing and
other times it's like there is no better
way to do this so bone for example might
go away and write a new a new system
that
does that thing that they want to do or
do it in a better way so there's
that's that's where a lot of the support
lies as well
emergent designers
yeah no we won't name any names here but
uh
i think another thing that we can
demystify is the idea that emergent
behavior only comes from our players
uh it's very it's i'm often
i often say that uh development is not
construction
it is exploration it it it is a search
for ideas and a search for solutions and
often times in game development
through the course of trying to create
one thing you inadvertently create
another thing and go oh that's
interesting
maybe we should do that on purpose and
that often that happens quite a lot in
game development we won't tell you which
ones are which uh well we don't keep a
list uh
now we're going to get into our uh the
question and answer period from the from
the backers here in a minute uh for
those of you who are wondering why we
spent this time you know talking about
building blocks and and and bringing
everybody up to speed here uh it's
because i want to preface this before we
get into some of these answers the
ui folks the ui team at star citizen
because we have this building blocks
because we've democratized the process
and and and allowed the system designers
for all these various teams to create
their core functionalities a lot of the
questions about core functionality
don't actually apply to the ui team
whereas that you otherwise might think
they do like you can't can this button
control all this stuff and stuff that's
actually something for the system
designers and those individual teams
that you're asking so uh we did
put the call out and
and grab some answers from some of the
other teams so we're not going to ignore
all the all the very specific drill down
questions but i just want you to keep in
mind that when we talk about some of
these
more granular details these are actually
the work of the eup feature team or the
vehicle feature team and stuff like that
and and the ui team sits above them
helping and assisting and you know
conforming and all that stuff like this
uh
starting with the the number one
question
like we we knew it this the second i
said hey you want to be on the show and
he said yeah and i said i'll tell you
what the number one question is going to
be and we were right uh any updates
whatsoever that you can give us on the
updated in-game star map
okay so
it's progressing um it's
it's really big system so
what we want to do with it and what
we've designed in the background which
we're not showing anybody yet
is
this really big system that kind of
combines
the radar the star map um potentially
some other ar markers and also the
interior map we think really that should
be one thing essentially so
like chris roberts has always had this
idea that he wants to be able to
start from the radar and zoom out from
that and you can see the star map and
you can zoom out and see the i know the
galactic view essentially so we've we've
been
writing around that idea um
so we've got this really massive design
that ties all those all those systems
together um which is pretty cool
um
we started writing code systems to
support that so we've we've got
i mean one thing that's tricky with it
there's all this data from all over the
game so we've got we've got all the
planets and stuff we've got the radar
data we've got even things like missiles
we've got to somehow tie that together
in a way that we can put into one place
so we spent quite a lot of time working
on the the tracking system for all that
stuff so that's all
it's all good now and and we're kind of
at the stage where we we want to start
building the building the real thing
so uh i mean the challenge is
spending the time to fit all that stuff
together so that's that's something that
we we've been kind of ticking along in
the background but we're going to start
ramping up on that very soon i think
couldn't give you a release date but uh
we don't we're really keen to get it
going and uh it's it's moving
um well we are working i i literally was
working on it this morning so you really
called me up jared but
yeah there's three things you did this
morning
i'm just i'm just messing with you
uh so the the the star map
we run into this with many features uh
they're they're they're inheritors of of
things from other systems the
the star map is not something we can
build in isolation all by itself and
then put out there and be like this is
your star map that's not the thing we
want to make the thing that the thing
that we're envisioning the thing that
you just described is this thing that
can inherit all kinds of data from radar
from scanning from
from from you know personal markers like
like the service beacons and stuff like
that it's got to inherit all be able to
inherit all this data from those other
systems and while those other systems
are still being worked on are still
being developed folks who watch our
public roadmap uh notice a change to the
uh fps uh scanning and radar uh intended
to come online in 316.
while those things are still changing
it's hard to build this thing that's
going to inherit all these things and
they're like oh we changed how it works
i'm like but i just hooked into it i
just looked into how it used to be and
you went and changed it so it's it's
definitely this obviously work that can
still be done you're doing it right now
but as far as uh
expectations of when and stuff like this
it is it is directly dependent not just
on your own workload but on the
continued progress of all these other
systems that it has to inherit
information from
um
another follow-up question to the star
map from the chat uh
will the design of this new star map be
similar to the arc star map that folks
have on the website right now uh scl q
and a's we don't aren't usually the
visual shows we don't usually have
things to show so uh
i guess describe
what should we be expecting paint us a
picture in our heads i guess
okay so i think anyone who's seen the
arc star map will have
a good idea of i suppose the general
idea of where we want to take it because
we we do all like that it's uh
i don't know it's easy to interact with
it's quite clear you can you know you
can navigate between different pieces of
it easily a lot more easily than what's
in game at the moment so that's
definitely an inspiration for us um so
visually you'll be i definitely wanted
to try want to try and push it a bit
further than that so try and get a bit
more a bit more of that sci-fi movie
feel to it
um and
in terms of functionality uh
because
it's kind of your window on the world i
think what we need to do as well is have
a bit more of a sort of google maps
apple map style navigation thing going
on so for example if you want to find a
planet on the other side of the solar
system being able to search for it
maybe just uh quite easily navigate to
it from this central interface i think
all that sort of stuff is going to make
it feel nice and so we're looking to
take inspiration from the best maps out
there overall
i hear
uh to answer uh a snakehawks question
how about not implementing the 100th
update on mining uh because these are ui
guys they're not building the mining the
the team who is doing the mining can
continue to work on mining while these
guys
work on their other stuff it's not a
either or a proposition that all the
teams don't just work on all the
features
yeah that's true i mean the main the
main way that we support other teams at
the moment we're kind of just the start
and the end of the process so
like bones team makes the initial bits
for people to make their
feature from i guess and then
ui team will sometimes
lend support on the visual side as well
so like at the moment we're working on
some uh refueling stuff so you are euphu
been working on that and
they've made this system that works
really well they've done ui that is okay
it doesn't look great um but they
they're not a team full of like ui
designers and artists so what we'll do
is pass some of the stuff over to our
our visual guys to kind of upgrade it
and make it look cool and star citizen
and then
the end product is really good but uh
yeah in general it's the code side that
that's involved with things like the mo
the the star map so it's yeah
and and i i will say it it's it's
working
those who have been following the
project for a while that uh you know uh
going back to
2014 2015 2016 days might remember a
familiar refrain which i'm sure i hope
it doesn't give you ptsd but you know
we're waiting it's like this feature is
waiting on ui this feature is waiting on
ui this feature is waiting on ui that
was such a
common refrain back in those days
because of what david just said uh
earlier about how it's like you get to
the end of the feature then it's like
okay slap a ui on it it's like it was
very clear that ui being downstream of
everything was not the solution for a
project as broad as star citizen so uh
uh not to keep harping on the success of
building blocks but you know building
blocks is having these these new you
know refinements to process that you
guys have made and the new tools that
you've provided have definitely sped up
uh the process
that said
like any team on star citizen any team
working on any feature there are only so
many things we can work on at any given
time you have to prioritize
and stuff like that so not everything
can be worked on all at once
so next question
sorry i just just to uh
um
i was at the sort of um
point of that uh
when when everyone was waiting for ui
and this is why chris
uh
correctly so sort of pivoted at the team
at that point so it's like this this
this isn't going to work we can't
develop
because we want to grow how many
features we're going to develop and
that's just unless we just
magic out of thin air another 20 ui guys
it's just not going to grow it just
turns into this great big bottleneck so
that is why around
2017 i think it was we did change the
mechanism that we wanted
to develop the ui and go wide and like
spread it across a lot of these teams so
we can
um
i want to say put the owners back on
them because because it's also like when
all when all any trouble comes in it's
not just developing it it's like at
release time
um
inevitably there's a you know there's a
few problems with any given feature but
if you
if
if you have 10 features and each of them
have a few ui bugs in then and they all
have to be done by one ui team becomes a
real bottleneck so it's really good to
go go wide across the company and each
of
each of those guys then get the
ownership of their particular feature
from start to finish and not just go
it's done just need to uh we're just
waiting on the ui guys it's like you are
the ui guys now right right
you know
some um
we did nice fancy graphics and
animations from the uh the
art design departments we deputized a
bunch of people on a bunch of different
teams throughout the company
congratulations
from the live chat here
moving on to another topic that's close
to a lot of people's uh performance
heart uh where was it mock driver 22
says how far are we from declaring star
citizen completely flash free
seven
we have seven to go are we seven along
how does that work what scale are you
using bone
oh i'm not giving you the scale i'm just
giving you a number
um
quite far i'd say i um i don't want to i
can't give her like a an
accurate number we're definitely past
halfway
um
we've got that we definitely got the
process down like we know exactly how
we're going to do it and we've got
designs for a lot of the things we want
to change over but a lot of it is
balancing new features i suppose with
going back to the old stuff and kind of
porting it over because we
one thing that we like to do i think
chris roberts likes to do this as well
is when we touch an old feature we don't
want to just take what was there and
just
put it in exactly the same we will tend
to work out what the problems were
redesign little bits maybe make it
visually better as well so it's quite a
quite an involved process to comfort
convert things over overall i think i
think it's a really good opportunity to
revisit because these are inevitably
some of the older features across the
game so it gives you an opportunity to
revisit them and say um
what's not great about these things what
would improve it you know would it
would it
look miles better with some
3d models and stuff or you know
better animations or i mean things like
the
inventory on the moby glass was just
completely redesigned because um
it wasn't a favorite feature of ours at
the time so like we looked at it and
went right actually if we're going to
redo this let's let's rethink it
in in a in a more
appropriate way but certain other things
are
if it ain't broke you know let's just
make a neater version of this that we
can
manage and
um
maintain a lot easier um maintaining the
old stuff has become quite difficult now
um like the knowledge base is
reducing of people that want to work on
this stuff
yeah and also also flash isn't really
supported anymore by adobe so
the the longer we go from
i know the further we get through time
the harder it is to to fix the flash
stuff so so we definitely want to
get that ported over and we can do i
think the major the major features that
we want to do is um there's a star map
which we're working on obviously bobo
gas is a big thing um the mfd is on
ships
and also the the visor so the the lens
advisor that the player looks through
um we want to update that and
bring that
into the modern day i guess
we said moby glass
i said mobile glass uh our
our biggest our biggest flash el wapo
uh for those who have seen three amigos
uh
what what progress can you give us on
the mobi glass rework
so
um at the moment i mean we've been
focusing mainly on other things so star
map or the design and so on and the the
back end of the star map has been taking
a lot of the focus aside from just
little bits and pieces pieces of
features here and there
um we're starting to
ramp up a little bit on the mobi glass
now so we're looking into some visual
prototyping work
um
what chris roberts wants to see he wants
to know
taking the new tech that we've got all
this 3d stuff and so on what can we do
to
make this make the mobi glass feel cool
but still be usable so
the first stage of that is we're going
to do some in-game prototyping and work
out i don't know what could what can we
do there how how cool can we make it
look yet to still be usable so there's a
bit of investigation to do there
and that's
it's going to take some iteration
between ourselves and also chris roberts
the game directors and so on until
they're happy with i know this is what
we want the moby bust to be
and then when that's signed off then
it's then we can actually start to to
make the thing
so
i think
i don't know how difficult it's going to
be to be honest because essentially
we're like it's like we're making a new
operating system almost we once we've
got that that core in place we know how
it looks how it works in 3d and so on
then in theory it's just the case
supporting all the old apps across so
like take the mission manager and update
it update that visually and so on so
i think it's one of those things that
once we've got over the initial hurdles
it'll start to speed up but i'm not
giving you any dates
no we don't we don't do dates here uh
this is a good time to reiterate
something you you you dropped kind of
casually early on we don't just want to
do
conversions of these things from flash
to you know building blocks and what
it's not just just make the same thing
like if you're gonna spend if you're
gonna spend
seven weeks i'm just pulling numbers out
of the air guys if i you're gonna spend
seven weeks converting this thing from
flash to building blocks and it's the
exact same thing why not take nine weeks
and actually redesign it you know make
it better improve upon it you know look
at some of these features that backers
have been asking for for so long some of
these features that we've been asking
for for so long uh and and take that
effort to redo it and make it better the
time so it does mean it takes a little
bit longer than just converting it over
but uh
you know ultimately it's worth it in the
end or we hope it will be
yeah what we're aiming for is like
this is the version of the moment that's
the final version of the moby glass so
once it's done then i know maybe we'll
polish it a little bit in future but
essentially it's good
uh will you consider adding a version of
snake
to play on the moby glass
that's a good question i think the chat
a few people have uh mentioned having
games on there so
we don't have it in the plans at the
moment but it would be a cool idea i'm
not i'm not against doing that one day
there are plenty of other things to do
in the game i would say like plenty of
other parts of game to get right before
we consider
mini games
legal's actually in the other room toast
does somebody own snake
he's not responding
um we'll
i'll check in with i'll check with him
and see what we can
see if it's even legally uh allowed um
let's move on to some other features one
of the most uh requested things it's
been popping up in chat a couple
questions
did you hear him he just said it's a
complicated question
he just yelled
she thought it was a gag he was really
there
i thought
yeah
that's usually my answer to any question
that simon gives me it's like can we do
this and i just go it's complicated
we'll just call it caterpillar
we'll be all right um all right so um
night vision nope cat alert
hold on
hi sorry hi cat
okay
we took our cat moment uh night vision a
night vision is a is is a big one
obviously in space it's
always some version of that i suppose
but you know as planets become a bigger
uh feature of star citizens more
gameplay moves down to them uh the
ability to see where you're going and
not crash into a mountain becomes super
important we recently uh
revamped ping
and gave it this brand new shader that
this is really cool
and kind of draws everything this um
have there been any discussions uh in in
any in any thoughts about implementing
some version of night vision beyond just
forcing people to put the ping on auto
fire
and just
constantly i don't know to be honest i
need to see where they're going
it's definitely that we need to
improve in some way but uh there's not
been already been any discussions on the
ui side for what we can change there i
think it's probably
it's probably more the kind of thing
that the vehicle team and the axe
feature team would look into to be
honest because they
once you can let people see in the dark
it's obviously got a load of gameplay
implications like you know people can
not hide anymore or
maybe we need to put ranges on things
and that kind of thing so there's loads
of gameplay implications to figure out
but um
yeah so i don't know where that is up to
i wouldn't be surprised if there's if
somebody's thinking about it right now
but uh it's not really a ui team thing
just now
fair enough
uh let's see
um you guys couldn't see it but the cat
was absolutely assaulting david during
uh simon's answer there
uh
what one of the one of the one of the it
was actually a halloween last year when
we first showed off uh the aegis uh
manufacturer specific you know style
guide uh for the ship huds
and since then we haven't seen a lot of
forward-facing information about it what
can you tell us about
maybe not just the aegis one but any
manufacturer based
ship heads how's that going
so um we've kind of
one thing we decided to do was do a
little bit of a halfway house because
initially we had this
we got this cool thing with that we've
been building
i mean we've been trying to get it
really good for squadron 42 so that was
the initial focus for the aegis hud and
we felt that
the amount of improvements that were
going on there the pu was missing out so
we've done this kind of intermediate
version at the moment which is what you
can see i think that's since the
previous release um it doesn't look it
doesn't look final it's not intended to
look final it looks kind of cool but
it's not not where we want to end up um
so
we've got that version that has all the
features in it we can do simple things
like change the colors and fonts if you
want to
um
but in terms of rolling out the the
proper final huds um the way we want to
do it is essentially get that initial
gladius hood internally get that
100 how we want it so all the features
on there so we have missile mode how we
want it bombs how we want it all the
different lock-ons and that kind of
thing and we're getting pretty close now
i think
um but chris roberts basically wants to
wait till wait till that's just right
and then we're going to decide how we're
going to roll that out to the rest of
the game
um
while we've been developing that it's
it's not so difficult for us to do
artwork as well so we've we've started
visual development on the drake hud as
well as rsi so those are ticking along
in the background
um but when they'll get rolled out to
everybody i'm not totally sure yet
okay yeah we we we've shown folks some
of the uh early concepts for the drake
hud we haven't shown anything for the
rsi hud just yet but yeah one thing that
way every week
it'll come
yep one thing we we started to do is
it's not the ship huds um but we started
to roll out some manufacturer styles for
the other screens in the ships so um for
crusader ships for example i think in
315 you'll you'll see on some of those
we've got some new door panels and we've
got a star that we can apply to the
elevators and so on so
um that work is starting to creep in
there even if it's not in the huds that
you see right now he even showed up on
some ships that weren't crusader in the
ptu
it's work in progress
um always fun
are there any plans to bring back custom
qt waypoints
oh that is a good question we had to ask
the uh
question really
what did they say
hang on
where is that
david what's the cat's name
that one's called ronnie that's one that
um has been confused by the uh
chain of the clock
the time changes and she thinks it's
an hour later than it is so it's
definitely tea time now according to her
all right i found the cutie waypoint
stuff so
i spoke to uh
john crew
and he said that vt
they do have plans for quantum in future
that it might not involve custom qt
waypoints but it should give the same
end result
so they're
the prototyping some ideas at the moment
but uh there's not a lot more they can
tell right now
okay
uh will the targeting ui get smarter
than just red and white targets such as
color codes for team members org members
faction members uh etc uh this would
really help during something like nine
tails yeah that's that's uh that's
something that we're looking into right
now we've we've we have had feedback
of expanding that system because
obviously just having i know good bad
and in between is quite you know
simplistic so um we've been looking at
some ex
potentially adding some extra colors in
there some extra icons and so on so you
can you know split out a lot more
information from that so it's we've been
having those conversations this week
actually so
the system will come online at some
point and we have got plans for it
um it's kind of that phase now where we
as a designer designers we kind of know
what we want to do with it we need to
get final sign-off from all the like
directors and so on and then
fairly soon that should start to make
its way into the game i think
um
mfds uh what technology blockers are
preventing my ship from saving mfd
status such as which screens i choose to
place on each mfd per ship
i'm going to guess that's probably just
waiting for the new mfd system to be
finished right
yeah uh
this is this is more amount of priority
so there's no
technical blockers it's it
once it's possible right now it's just
not
um
you wouldn't write it with the current
system because we would want to it would
just be like wasted work um so
we're in the process of upgrading the
way that the ui works on mfds and part
of that upgrade will include
much better customization and the much
better customization will inevitably
lead to
wanting to be able to persist that
customization from session session or
um
in different vehicles and stuff so um
yeah that's part of
that block of work that they're doing
you know
pretty much yeah is inbuilt into that
task so technically no blocker but the
blocker is a priority issue or more than
anything else
um
the chat here um
can we please have the old landing hood
back
yes um yes at some point
yeah so um we we have got plans to bring
this back at some point yeah um it ties
in a little bit with what we want to do
the radar because um
you know you've got that spherical radar
thing at the bottom so it
some of the functionality relates
relates to that so it's part of that
design to a degree and we yeah
it's definitely planned
okay um
this is a big one for a lot obviously
star citizens are maybe not the normal
uh a batch they're not all running
16 by nine
you know 1920 by 1080 screens
by any means
are there any plans to improve the ui so
it better fits non-standard aspect
ratios like ultra ultra ultra wide
screens yeah i can see bone hey how you
doing
what do you think about this bone
um
yes
so there's a one word answer to this
which is yes and then
i could go all night about
what we're doing to improve this
um
give it give us the 10 cent version
right so aspect ratios are
the thing that gives most ui designers
ui engineers like the absolute
fear um
it's just bane of our lives um
but i totally appreciate that especially
on pc games as well that my people have
some cool setups of
30 to like
nine and 48 by nine but also some
strange people have four by three aspect
ratio screens and things like this
so
or at least you can run it in a window
that is four three and all these kind of
things so yes we have to build in a lot
of tech to deal with this um
so we have
stuff
that's kind of like when you resize your
window on a
web browser or something and you see you
know the text jiggles around and it
aligns itself properly or being well if
it's designed correctly so it's all
flexible like that so the system is
designed to be flexible
the coordinate system can change for the
aspect ratio so
you know you don't see stretch things
and things like that
so that like a core level yes it's
inbuilt
but then
um there's a design level that all the
assets have to be designed in a way that
can be flexible
um
so
that's pretty tricky because you have to
make lots of choices about you know well
if it gets all squished up do all these
things go along the bottom or or do they
get clipped off at the end or do they
shrink down and all these kind of
decisions that have to be made by each
for each individual design
and then we've got individual
like responses for things so
things like the front end we've just
pretty much gone with a 16 by nine
aspect ratio and we just
black bar the
wider screens and
uh or black bar the top and bottom if
you're on a on a square screen
um and that that's it's a bit of a cop
out for that screen but it's nice
because you you just
you can design a nice looking 16x9
layout for the whole front end where it
gets a bit more tricky is things like
the lens and visor
because that's
that's obviously a lot more
emergent and then we still have to make
a lot of decisions about this where
um
i mean the tech supports this but it's
just about making design decisions let's
say you've got like um different icons
in the top left and top right hand
corner if you have three monitors do you
want those into the top left and right
corners of those three monitors because
that's not really in your eye line
you're going oh how where's my map or
how many bullets do i have or whatever
it is and you sort of
it's
having three monitors is a bit more
about having a lot of peripheral vision
it's not about like moving all the way
up or the ui the way up all the way out
um so there's a lot of design decisions
that go along the lines of that so yes
we're working on that also
and finally um one of the bigger
problems of
one of the bigger challenges sorry of a
star citizen
is it's diegetic so
uh that means like all this ui is
actually in world on physical objects so
we've got um
maybe a 16 point benign panel or even
the mobi glass is actually a 16 minute
panel that you're holding in front of
you like this so that comes with
challenges of saying well if i've got a
very square monitor and i'm trying to
look at this wider aspect ratio
screen where'd you position your camera
i mean because only so far you can move
your arm back and head back to try and
see see this
uh oblong thing in a square square hole
um same goes for using the kiosks um do
you just get a lot more peripheral
vision do you have to move the camera
back does the guy have to stand further
away we're having to make decisions to
make it
be logically correct and fit in to the
universe properly not like just
um we don't we don't cheat in any point
for these things but it becomes really
tricky um we are really designing the
visor too because currently the visor is
it's actually physically a physical
piece of geometry a piece of glass with
ui on it and it sort of
sits in front of the camera like this as
you move the camera around it goes with
the camera
but that inherently has problems of well
it's it's
it's a piece of glass at 69 aspect ratio
so what what you want to do if you want
to draw things outside of that piece of
glass it was sort of restricted
so we're redesigning that and coming up
with different solutions to that to make
that work properly but
on the whole yes we're working on it but
it makes me cry on quite a regular
basis the desire for a diegetic world
in a
reality of
differing aspect ratios i mean i mean i
i i when i move the game over to my
vertical monitor on the right here i
mean it's just garbage
there's no support for my vertical
alignment at all
just put that out there just
um
raises a ticket with that
yeah we'll put it on the backlog
oh will we at some point be able to
change the color
of our huds a light blue hud over a
snowy white planet and moon can be kind
of hard to make
out this is it's kind of two bits to
this i suppose there's the
there's a legibility thing like how easy
is it how easy is it to read and then
there's the customization thing so
um
in terms of legibility we're we're
always looking into better ways to do
that so we have a thing at the moment
where it
it automatically makes the screen a bit
brighter and and increases the drop
shadow on bright backgrounds so that's
that's a little step in the right
direction but we're always looking to
waste we can improve that so
ideally we want to get to a point where
players wouldn't need to change the
colors to be able to see the stuff
i think
we're getting there
and then in terms of customization
the direction at the moment is we want
to we want to kind of make each
manufacturer feel unique so especially
starting with the ships we want
people to be able to say okay my drake
ship looks like this with these
particular colors and my rsi ship looks
this way
so we're definitely heading more towards
that direction at the moment
um technology wise
it is it would be possible for us to
allow things to be customized but
i think that's something we'd look at
look at after we've got the i know the
vision the ideal vision in place first
go ahead
no just to reiterate what simon's saying
ideally we wouldn't
it wouldn't be an issue that you'd want
to change the colors if if the
legibility was
you know
uh perfect across all these different
environments again it's the same
uh story with uh it being diegetic that
uh
the visor and the lens and the her head
up displays are actually in world so the
um
the same effects are applied to them
that uh applied to real pieces of glass
in world so you know the exposure is
different and
what's behind them we can't really
control we can't control if they're
looking at the sun or the blackness of
space so
there's automatic exposure control to
change a bit like you get on a on a
smartphone it brightens up in
in bright environment darkens down it's
obviously more complex because it's
translucent
um
so in an ideal world we would fix all
the problems so people wouldn't have to
or feel like it was a like a requirement
and
that would i don't think it would work
long term anyway because
like you're you're flying on somewhere
that's
snowy for instance and you decide to
pick colors that would look good against
the snow and then you suddenly fly into
space and then it doesn't look good it's
it's not really a solution you have to
keep
configuring your colors
to to be able to read the ui really the
ui should be adapting to the environment
properly and hopefully we'll solve that
or at least get it dialed in a lot
better
i i wonder
i wonder if if if if maybe
it's
i mean
you can look uh
which i think had a says i wonder if
maybe even just a
single button
light dark mode toggle
might just help folks you know you know
if it's just you know put it in their
control like you know it's light mode
when they're flying everywhere else and
then when they happen to be facing the
sun or they happen or they go down to
the surface of microtech they can hit
one button and just switch it to to a
nightmare which is which is a darker you
know themes i wonder if something like
that might just
resolve a lot of these issues in the
meantime but
yeah
well we've definitely talked about it
for
visually impaired people as well anyway
um to because certain uh colors are not
as easy to um
uh decipher so
the will we have talked quite a lot
about how we can customize this and make
it a lot more
approachable for different different
people to use
um
let's see we've only got we've only got
a couple minutes left um
let's see
uh
one of the big features coming along in
alpha 316 is refueling uh we're going to
talk about refueling on isc in a couple
weeks but uh
as far as the ui the interface and stuff
like that uh
what what's your guys involvement been
in refueling up to this point
okay well refueling is a good one
actually it's going really well so um
when we started out there was we began
with the game there was a game design
dock that uh euphu made which was pretty
cool and then initially we had some i
had some conversations with those guys
we just roughed out some really basic
ideas for the ui so like i would just
draw some boxes and put text on so they
they had an idea of
a very vague direction where i would
take it and then you kind of left it
with them for a bit
and they've been implementing the actual
system then
using the building block stuff they put
in this kind of placeholder ui so
it's all working and it's good it just
looks a bit rough around the edges
and then i think i mentioned it before
we've now kind of
we haven't taken it off them we're
working really closely with them to kind
of take that and make it good so
processors we've got uh one of the guy
one of the guys is
it's kind of a mixture between a graphic
designer and a ui designer so he's
basically
he's taking those initial screens and
rejigged the layout a little bit and
resize things and also applied this nice
color scheme and little graphical
elements on there so he's going to make
these
visual versions that are 2d they're just
kind of
in photoshop or whatever and then on the
other hand we've got one of our
technical ui designers who's taking
those concepts and kind of marrying them
up with
the stuff that you
put created so kind of actually
implementing it in building blocks so
that's kind of that's the ideal process
and it seems to be working really well
just now so i'm pretty happy with that
and i guess everyone will get to see it
quite soon yeah folks will get their
first look at refueling in a couple
weeks sometime after iae
uh and when we do show it remember like
all things it'll be still be work in
progress when you see it uh
just important to remember that
everything you see on isc is work in
progress we put it down in the corner
but sometimes folks still like what does
it look like
it's working progress just look at the
bombs remember how the bombs looked in
in in isc and like oh the bombs are a
little overwhelming and then you get
into pt and it's like oh wow you're like
you can see them from miles away it's
like
work in progress we waited to the last
show of the season we waited as long as
we could to get those great bomb visuals
in and sometimes you just it's just not
ready in time so it's work in progress
remember it's always working progress
i would tattoo that somewhere if i could
um
chat here's another big one will in-game
chat uh
get a overhaul for display that will
allow us to display multiple chat tabs
with different colors maybe all in the
same feed
chat customization
yeah it's a good question is chat is one
of those things that we need to port
over at some point soon um we've not
really looked into what we want to
change design-wise i'm sure there'll be
things like that that we want to sort of
polish up
um but uh yeah it's all right it's an
hour to do this basically
so when we when we get to it we'll
check out what's there we'll see what
the competition is doing like there's a
lot of other games out there that do a
good job of chat and we'll work out you
know what actually we want to put into
it and then
hopefully what you get out of the other
end is is great
but uh we haven't quite got to the point
where we're working on that yet
and maybe for some of us the option to
just defaulted to turned off
another big uh another big question that
comes up quite often
this is probably something along with
like the star map work um
overall what's involved in the creation
of a coordinate system
uh obviously we have service beacons and
stuff now but it can be very difficult
to determine where you are on a planet
or in space and easily tell other people
where you are it's like this um
what what what what what's involved in
that kind of work is this something that
we're ever going to have is something
that we can't have is something that's
in progress what can you tell us
so well um
i guess the way that games are made in
3d graphics as well you generally have
this like xyz coordinate system which
is fine like if you want to see where
this pen is in my room i can say it's
like three
i know three across and two up whatever
which is fine but then
when you're in space oh actually imagine
you're on a moon that's hot it's
rotating that's orbiting around a planet
which is orbiting around the sun so
those
xyz coordinates aren't going to work so
what we think we need to do is have like
a system that relates to what you are on
so
if i'm on that moon i want to know i
know what's my angle relative to the
center of the moon and how far out am i
from that so we probably go with
something along those lines
in terms of putting into the game it's
going to tie in quite closely with the
new star map radar
so we definitely do want to have that in
there when we release a new version of
those so
minimum will display where you are so
people can say oh but this is this
relative to stanton system for example
um what we would like to do ideally is
have some way of sharing those
those details so maybe you can right
click and send
the location to one of your friends all
that kind of thing
we still need to work out the details on
that but
we definitely want to improve that
that whole area overall
uh
folks you've done it
your hour is done
did it go by faster than i said like i
said it would
it was pretty quick yeah yeah
there's always like oh can i fill up a
whole hour then at the end they're like
i went by really fast uh thank you guys
for taking the time to
show up on the show
this week we don't get to have you on
very often
simply because
the ui team is probably the one team in
the entire company that touches every
single aspect of star citizen's
development there is no aspect of star
citizen that doesn't involve ui in one
way shape or form so
these folks usually have their hands
pretty full so thank you for taking the
time to join us here at the end of this
week uh that's it for star citizen live
outer space interface uh
come back next week next week on isc we
have a show entirely dedicated to the
future of space combat
with the vehicle experience team uh they
got a whole nice little presentation
about uh
the current work they're the work of
their immediate future and then some
look at some long-term stuff
it's a great lead in before ie starts
the next week before and then uh next
friday when we come back here uh we're
going to have a a super a rare guest
let me have to tune in and find out it's
somebody who's made a lot of spaceships
for us and somebody who's made more
spaceships than anybody in the history
of our game it's mr gavin rothery uh
concept artist extraordinaire and film
director and all kinds of stuff so we're
gonna have him on the show and talk a
bit about his uh career and
and and life and work on star citizen so
check that out next week uh four star
citizen live
i'm jared
that was simon
that was david bonegill i think we made
it through without calling you bone a
bunch of times uh take care everybody
we'll see you next week cheers bye
see i told you that'd be easy
it's easy when you know what you're
talking about
[Laughter]
you
