## Transcript

hello everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live the vfx team
i'm your host jared huckabee and if
you've never seen star citizen live
before it's where we take about an hour
out of the end of our week
and chat with some of our developers get
a feeling of what they work on
sometimes what they don't work on and
take questions from you the star citizen
community
so let's jump right into it no more me
everybody get everybody in the group
here
the vfx team hello gentlemen welcome
uh it's been a while since we've done
kind of a a a round table
uh q a so let's let's take a few minutes
now introduce everybody because
every show is somebody's first show
we're gonna start with
we're gonna start with you jacob you go
first
who are you and what do you do hello i'm
jacob and i'm a
vfx technical artist at tng
what does a vfx technical artist do
uh so it in a software called
houdini despite the title i don't always
focus on vfx related
stuff and i'm kind of just anything
relating to the software
i kind of tackle and handle like most
tech artists
i think yeah i think but yeah the last
one i did was for the character
for the character tech art team so yeah
around everywhere
i i find that tech artists generally
bridge a gap between
artists and like programmers and stuff
it's
uh making tools and and stuff like that
to help people other
other people do their work my writing
easier
yeah okay yeah save you time from having
to do repetitive things
uh leo who are you and what do you do
for star citizen
hello i'm leo i'm a vfx programmer
i program vfx
um yeah basically i
make sure that the vfx are being
triggered
at the correct time in game make sure
they're running
like optimized like the performances
isn't too bad um yeah things like that
how does a how does a programmer work
with artists
what's that relationship like
um so usually uh vfx artists
come to me with like we want to bring
this
to life like this this certain effect
and then
we have a discussion about like how to
implement it how to make sure that like
it fits in like the performance
requirements
and uh like that we have to require tech
as well to to actually do it um
when i go to them it's usually when
there is a problem
when they made a mistake in the data and
then i go to
do them and tell them that's what i made
a problem
please fix it for me that's what i was
waiting for uh taiyo
how often does leo tell you no you can't
do a thing
um i actually work uh a lot with leo
i'm a vfx artist so uh we
some sometimes i come to him with
something i'd like to do
um and vice versa but
yeah uh oftentimes it's him telling me
that i've made a mistake so
yeah he shows he helps me to fix it
fair enough and uh mike who are you what
do you do for star citizen
yes i'm mike i'm the vfx director so the
vfx team
is is run by me basically um so yeah all
of the stuff that the guys have just
said i sort of i'm the umbrella with
which all that
uh i guess
i would there's a veil of pretense there
i guess i i definitely go to leo a lot
saying leo can we do this
and uh i know i say yeah
then i say but really can we you still
get it
you still get in there and get your
hands dirty around so while i just yes i
yeah just yesterday on isc we showed the
uh the dying star
lightning doodle that you were working
on yes
yeah yes i did that yeah i did that i
think you said it was
an artist did it in a meeting so yeah i
was i was just in another meeting and i
had the editor open
as as we tend to do uh obviously with
the with the
world situation we're all we're all
online in meetings a lot but
we're still working so yeah i was
messing around with the lightning
regions and the the reason for that
there wasn't i was
legitimately doing doing work i wasn't
just playing um we were kind of
revisiting the lightning with
the view to a future release so yeah i
just uh doodled with some effects and
they looked okay all right so
if you've never seen star citizen live
before uh we take questions from the
star citizen community we take them from
one of two different places
if you're watching live right now on
twitch you can submit your question with
the word question
in capital letters surrounded by
brackets that's going to help our
community management team pull it out of
the chat and send it along to me
we also put up a thread earlier in the
week on spectrum the communication
platform up on
robertsspaceindustries.com where we
collected questions let people vote up
which questions they wanted to see
answered most as
usual a portion of the questions
were for teams other than the vfx team
so if you're auditing the broadcast and
you see that we're skipping some
questions that were voted up
uh chances are it's because they were
for a different team other than the vfx
team
uh but right off the bat we are going to
start with the most voted up question
the most voted up question was a
question for another team
but we went and researched some of the
answer for you anyway so we'll start
right off
uh what is our progress on planetary in
atmosphere volumetric clouds
jumping straight with the arcana so yeah
i mean just
just through what joe just said we we
aren't actually
directly working on that that is that is
another team who's who's working on the
planetary clouds themselves like the
creation and composition of the clouds
i can say that i've seen some fantastic
progress
recently over the last few months i
guess things have really picked up there
i know that like
taiyo for example um also excited
about the clouds um yeah looking really
good
we will come into that process at a
later date so definitely vfx will
will play a large part of of making
clouds work in the game our role there
will be very similar to what we do with
the gas cloud so
all the kind of internal effects that
are in gas clouds or will be in gas
clouds that's kind of going to be
similar with planetary clouds um and gas
giants and things like that
obviously with with clouds it's a very
specific type of effect so it's just
helping
with the sense of motion so it'd be very
misty and damp and
the wetness i guess of clouds so i think
that's probably where our
our work will kick in i know leo will
will be heavily involved in that from a
from a code
whose side of things yeah what is the
team that's currently working on clouds
is it great it's not graphics it's
i guess it's just cortex yeah it's
balti's team is it yeah
it's it's well it's under it's marcos
marcos
overall it's marco's team isn't it yeah
tech group
well yeah i've been trying to get marco
on a show for years well
it might it might happen someday uh
speaking of clouds let's go to rain it's
a bit dry in the verse right now
can you help us literally what the
question is it's a bit dry in the first
right now
can you help people want more rain what
can we tell them
yeah i mean this kind of follows on from
work but i just said i guess so
once once we're in a position where the
clouds are
are in and and those hurdles have been
overcome
then absolutely rain is going to be a
consideration
you know rain is going to come from
clouds so you can't do rain until you've
got the clouds
uh again like um leo you know that's
that's something we've chat about
recently isn't it
there's clouds that that have rain
there's going to be other considerations
other than just the markup of the actual
cloud but you know the
i remember you mentioning we're going to
need to sort of understand
that you're underneath the cloud for the
for the markup for the rain aren't you
as well
yeah yeah so for the clouds we'll have
to basically need to
get access to to the density of a cloud
um
and from there we'll have to to kind of
write systems that that that now like
where are you compared to the to the
cloud um
are you underneath the clouds like is it
is it a rainy cloud is it
like um not all clouds have have
rain so we'll we'll have to kind of
make a weather system as well that that
takes in consideration that the pressure
the temperature the humidity we have
some basics already and for that but
like with clouds that it will get a lot
more complex
and that that's like one of the things
that we'll need
for for rain to appear but like at the
end
another thing that we'll need is this
like rain isn't just like
raindrops falling everything needs to
look wet as well
so our surfaces need to look wet we
we do have the visor and the canopy
shaders that
where like raindrops appear on your
visor
and that will like help a lot with the
feeling of rain but
like there are still quite a few things
that will need to be done
uh for before rain actually gets in
are are you looking forward to the days
when you get when you have to tackle
this or are you dreading it
i'm looking forward to it it's it sounds
like a really exciting
like project and especially with the
clouds
um yeah so we're getting a lot
yeah uh we're getting a lot of questions
in general about
uh various weather effects why don't we
just do kind of a
kind of a catch-all topic on on weather
here um
mike what are our current intentions
as best as you know them as you know
realizing that this is a system bigger
than just vfx
so as you're aware of them what are our
current intentions uh
for weather in star citizen how far are
we looking to go
well uh with it with with cig being cig
and with the project that we're working
on we
we want full weather systems eventually
don't we um we want
we want all of that we want it to be you
want to be able to see it when you're on
the planet
or the moon you want it to be able to
see it from space as well so obviously
we've got fantastic real world
reference and footage of these
phenomenons and we want to get as close
to that as we can
in in real time and you know across a
server
we want you want to be able to have
europe in in space you're looking at
your the planet down there you can see
this giant
let's just say a hurricane or a giant
rain
formation um you want to be able to see
that from a distance but there could be
someone that's right in the middle of
that right in the thick of it you know
in a storm
and it's it's those two extremes and
everything in between
as always for for our game but for the
vfx in particular
so yeah sandstorms i've seen people
asking questions about sandstorms
um i feel like yeah just every
everything that you would expect from a
weather system we we we want to support
that in in the future for sure
thank you and it it's oh my my button
just switch you back doesn't work there
it goes uh
so yeah so obviously we are at a very
ambitious game and we are
we are going to pursue uh pushing this
tech as far as we
you know possibly can that's not the
same as us sitting here saying we're not
mike's not staying here today
there will be hurricanes in the game he
is saying that we
we absolutely want to pursue that in
every other weather system
whether they make that in whether they
can be done with
other necessities and other priorities
for the game uh that's one of those
things the time will tell but uh
we definitely have to drive here yeah
and the reality is that it wouldn't just
be a vfx thing anyway because you know
the vfx team would would
create a thing that looks like a
hurricane but if we're talking about
weather systems then
you know that that's a much that's much
higher up the chain that that's that's a
very fundamental game system there
yeah and we've already seen a lot of the
groundwork like leo just said that's
there
uh the the planet uh content team has
gone through in all of their different
planetary revisions like now all the
different biomes are set with
humidity zones instead in temperature
zones and stuff like that so
so we have the foundation for something
like that
already in place now through the work of
the planet planet content team so
it's definitely something where moving
towards
uh
what kind of visual effects can we
expect with
future stars and suns right now we've
only got the one
sun at the at the center of uh the
stanton system
um have you guys started prototyping
other kinds of stars other kinds of suns
i know someone who could answer that
are they here
so yeah we did i did a um experiment
kind of mostly regarding my work with
gas clouds where we needed to start
simulating
magnetic fields to try to create a bit
more
organic kind of feel and give a bit more
detail and life into things
and it's actually we can actually use
that tech and did
try using it to create
the details and vector fields to help
move particles
to try and simulate the movement as with
the sun so you get the
the surface movement as well as some of
the the corona flares kind of
coming out there's a good kind of test
an initial test that was good
highlighting where
we might need to improve one in the
future and where we could definitely add
um it does have a lot of potential to
just look absolutely awesome
does that kind of thing extend to
something like an aurora borealis in the
in the atmosphere of a planet or
something
potentially it does create uh that kind
of aurora borealis kind of
you know it's partly due to positive
ions kind of hitting the atmosphere
which is a magnetic field and you get
that movement because of the magnetic
field so
you inherently get that movement from it
so yes it can be used to generate the
vector field required for it but i know
mike has also done tests
were way back in the past to show off
the whole particle system
creating audible oreos just from
articles alone so
we've got many different ways to do that
that was that was when we first had the
spline
spline guided particles wasn't that a
thing yeah
um the the the pyro system actually
might
um might require that sort of stuff uh
sun flares
mostly there was there was
talk about it uh back when we
did start um citizencon and
so more tests probably will be made
towards that
yeah i mean we've had discussions with
um with other teams actually regarding
solar plays
one question that i would straight away
ask but something like that is like how
close can the player actually get to
that thing
because because jake could make an
absolutely phenomenally
accurate looking sun-like
creation with with potential for
really nice solar flows but if design
before that
take a step back like if design decided
that actually you couldn't get that
close because
there's nothing there's no tech in the
game and this is just purely speculating
by the way but if you can't get close
enough to it then why invest all that
time and resources into making it look
so detailed
is it is it oh we'll look at that one
later
um let's look at the chat here
uh how close are we to seeing light uh
lightning
or anything dynamic inside gas clouds
uh let's say we're quite close is that
is that non-committal
i i i actually have i actually have a i
actually have a scale
uh i was having to explain to somebody
if i say um
if if if i say in the near future or
uh in an upcoming release i'm talking
six to nine months out
if i say across our continuing
development i'm talking nine or
nine months out or more like that so i
have a whole code that i use
but nobody else does well with that
without putting a time frame on it uh
obviously as i mentioned
earlier on like we i've been looking at
the the lightning
effects options that we've got in the
game and we we've we must have
i mean i know we've shown over the
probably over the last couple of years
examples of really nice looking
lightning we can do
really cool stuff in our engine what i'm
doing at the moment part of my
of ongoing q1 task is i'm i'm looking at
the tool set
to to sort of see if it's user-friendly
enough to see if it can do all the
things that i know we're going to be
able to
we're going to need to be able to do
when we have lightning
in pyro locations like say in a gas
cloud in pyro
perhaps the art director ian wants that
let's just say for example i need to
make sure that we're able to do that and
then the other side of it
what what we can't currently do what we
haven't
fully implemented yet is like the
systemic
uh placement of the lightning so um in
various cities and cons actually
thinking about it now we've we've kind
of shown
what we want to do in the gas clouds we
can currently manually place
really really good looking lightning but
we want to and this is where leo again
would come in
and the other vfx programmers we want to
have a system where
the the data of the gas cloud drives
those effects
so maybe design want lightning to
become increasingly stronger the closer
the player gets to an area that is
dangerous or maybe it needs to just be
more frequently
flaring up and frequently occurring and
whichever design decision gets made
there will dictate how
leo implements that um that lightning
so yeah it's coming along and i
appreciate it kind of these things
sometimes take longer than might be
expected but
uh lightning is a very very powerful
thing that we've got in our game yeah
and it's really fun to play with this
one it's good good fun
so basically it's all in leo i mean it
usually is you know
we're the artists just we just oh hey i
want to be able to do this really cool
thing
uh can you go work out all the details
please
no no we we do have like a team of
programmers for the vfx team as well so
we'll share the burden but yeah i mean
like the lightning um it again
it's one of those interesting projects i
i think they're all
almost all the projects we do are like
interesting because
we get to do more than just like
implement the lightning
that you place in a location
you what what we want for our game like
everything needs to be systemic so the
lightning needs to be dynamically
um spawned let's say and and
currently we have the deck to place the
lightning
just in like in the level but that
doesn't really work at scale that we're
uh that we want to
develop the game so um
for us like we've had a lot of
discussions about this already and
it will come down to like how do we
drive this lightning systemic so
do we have like some kind of electricity
value in the gas cloud and then
different gas clouds can have different
electricity values and then if you go
into the denser parts of the the gas
clouds you you have more
lightning and then like lightning is
spawned
in the denser parts and then for the
programmers is it's
how do we manage all those light things
that they are kind of like
separate objects so how do we manage
them how do we make sure that
we don't spawn too many like lightning
objects and
those kind of things so it's it's quite
interesting to
work on these kind of projects one of
the things that
i'm sorry um if you want a visual
update on how that might look uh the if
you catch the end of the main
citizencon 2019 presentation when
the ship uh when the carrick arrives in
the pyro system
there are some uh some of those
lightning
uh events happening in the background
those
that's the system that we're talking
about yeah and you made them didn't you
i i placed them yeah yeah
one of the things i really liked about
your your doodle that we showed
yesterday mike was
uh how the emissive lighting system
just followed the lightning out as the
lightning was at the lightning was
growing
the the you could see the you can see it
you know
emitting light throughout the cloud as
it was going and that was
that was really cool yeah that's a good
point so yeah i was testing two things
at the same time then because that was a
custom build
um with the the new particle lighting
model that's
underway and again tayo i know you
you're a big fan
and caleb our principal's been really
putting it through its paces
simon the lead vfx program has been been
implementing this new lighting model
and yeah as you say jared so so having
large-scale sort of um like
like dusty cloudy effects
traditionally that's really difficult
like you know we we use
texture the bigger the thing is the the
more obviously there's
texture and the less the lighting can
affect smaller areas but this this
lighting model
is looking really promising it's very
physically based
um that's because i'm sure simon's
role in his eyes as i just say that but
it's like there's a there's a
there's a much more authentic sort of
lighting set of rules that it adheres to
that that makes it harder for us to
break basically
which which is is important because with
the scale
and an amount of effects in our game
like it's the
the rules the way that the the lighting
behaves has to be consistent
otherwise it can become yeah our effects
can just break and not hold up in
different lights
systemic systems have to be at the heart
of so much
otherwise it just it it runs the risk of
getting away from us
yep yep let's talk about the new shield
reworks uh
we saw the first version of sdf shields
yeah
in 312 uh one i guess technically when
the
when the idris and the javelin came out
with the
uh the xenothread event uh we know in
313
that you know now you know the the rest
of the ships the ships that players
can own and fly and stuff like that are
all being converted to sdf shields
uh with the new shield reworks are we
going to be able to see better
when front shields are being hit
i know that this is a particularly uh uh
valid talking point that we've had
internally i've seen you in meetings
specifically
about finding ways to improve that
visibility
100 yes i mean that that was that was
very high upon the list when we when we
did the
the the shield rework using the sdfs
definitely i was i was conscious of the
the current the existing effects are
just too intrusive on on the win
you know on the on the cockpit view so
that was 100 percent at the top of the
list for
for things that we need to improve so
yeah we've we've done that um it's
it's going to be yeah you're not going
to get as annoyed hopefully
um by the by the impact effects it's
tricky because you've got to find a
balance because you still need to
to acknowledge that it's like that part
of the shield is getting hit
you can't just cheat and just not have
anything draw because then from a
gameplay point of view you know
you've lost that readability so um it's
just a it's just a balancing act that
the artist
has to to strike to to make sure that
the effects still work from the exterior
view
and still adhere to all the gameplay
requirements there
i.e changing color to reflect the
weakening of the shield
but yeah i mean it's sort of it's one of
my pet peeves of being honest
especially with testing all the weapon
effects as i was doing a lot last year
getting that shield just just covering
the screen all the time yeah so we're
gonna
improve that cool
uh let's see let's see what else do we
got
um oh another very popular one
uh in chat here uh do you plan
to update the the quantum travel effects
we do we do plan to do that yeah um
this is another example i guess where
it's not just something that the effects
team on their own would
do like i hope i just don't sound like
i'm repeating the same thing but
our effects are driven by by other
things so that there's a lot of kind of
gameplay
mechanisms that that trigger the actual
ship going into quantum travel itself
and our effects are very much driven by
that so there's a lot of factors there
speed and the spool up and all those
kind of things lots of hooks
i use the word hooks quite a bit um for
which we
couldn't spawn our effects but yeah
because now we've got sdf shields as
well
that came in first with atmospheric
entry and then we're using for shields
there's no reason why we shouldn't be
trying to use sdfs
on other effects and quantum travel be a
great example of that i think
yeah um i'm going to take a i'm going to
take a moment here
uh uh sam citizen markley i see sam
citizen markley in the chat right now
and i want to i
want to talk to sam citizen markley we
we used some of
sam's footage in isc yesterday you know
how we
we take community footage and we always
kind of attribute
who it was we accidentally attributed
his footage to
rexilla and we caught it after the
episode went live
so uh sam i see in the chat
i appreciate your footage and i hope you
accept my humble apology for incorrectly
attributing your footage to uh to
another star citizen
i had the opportunity i think you know
hey i just want to say our back
the footage that our backers show is
just incredible i never get bored of
seeing it it's amazing
plus it helps us debug a lot of issues
that we have in the
actual yeah and and and
it was great footage of the upcoming
stanton 7 race and if you don't know
what the stanton 7
stuff is check that out ask a friend
because that looks pretty cool coming up
all right is there any
chance ships maneuvering vfx will
increase
in size or intensity in the future the
carrick for instance
demonstrates palpable vertical thrust
cones when strafing upwards
but most spacecraft produce small candle
like flames representing multiple g's
what were you thinking
no i had i added that last part
um yeah so
i just want to make sure i'm not not the
only person talking by the way i've got
a habit of
just saying things first so yeah i mean
i appreciate that a lot of the
maneuvering thrusters
um got that sort of potential through
looking a bit like a candle flame
compared to
the main thrusters sometimes it's just
the scale of the actual thruster
item itself you know if if if the ship
has
has a really small nozzle
then it's probably gonna look even worse
if i give it this ridiculously oversized
like five times longer than the ship
effect you know i mean it's it's not
always going to work so it's definitely
we're sort of definitely
um at the mercy of the ship design in
that
sense but there are there's definitely
things like
i guess relating to that we we're doing
some work at the moment
on just the wind volumes and
it's all sort of what that is
specifically is we want to make sure
that the
effects match the physical volume that
these dusters generate because i think
it came in did it come in 312
we got the the thruster volumes tail can
you remember
yeah you're the force like uh yeah
you're being affected by the force yeah
yeah yeah yeah so
so we we just need to make sure that our
effects properly match the physical
force itself
um so yeah we're doing some work on that
leo i guess
you you've got some knowledge on on that
system if
it's worth us talking about that a bit
i mean yeah i i feel like um
there are different things that we could
do that for example like
increase like add a separate strength
value
or like have some kind of dynamic
behavior based on
if you're in the atmosphere we already
do something similar for shock diamonds
on the main thrusters so
potentially we could do like use
like that data we do have anyway to to
do something special with those
like the smaller thrusters if necessary
um i mean the ground effects uh as you
mentioned with like the
birth thruster and volume state i think
they will help quite a bit as well to
give more
punch to to the thrusters especially if
you're close
close to the ground yeah because because
that's the thing because it's not
necessarily that that we want like to
have a really hot emissive
long thrust effect that you can clearly
see hitting the floor
if you're sort of high up and then
there's enough force coming from a
smaller thruster that is this displacing
all that snow
or that sand or whatever this surface is
then i think that will help as well for
sure
and that's definitely in the works
you mentioned uh you you mentioned that
your work on the thrusters is directly
dependent on the work that comes before
you which is the
size and placement of the thrusters
themselves
a lot of what you tend to work on this
is this is similar
of the vfx team as well as teams like
the audio team tends to be downstream
of so many other teams um
is that is that a good thing
be honest here is this a good thing for
you guys is this a frustrating thing for
you guys is this just
one of those things that has to be that
way in video games i mean
it can't be i guess it can be
frustrating but it's it's not
it it is the way it's got to be you know
audio are the most downstream i should
have as well because
any effects that we make then audio's
got to
like provide the audio that matches the
thing we've made but it's just part of
the process you know
as you say like we used to you said
downstream and that is a phrase that
that everyone hears a lot in cig
it affects the scheduling you know like
we can't make a thrusters effect until
the thruster exists
um so maybe from a scheduling point of
view it makes things more complicated
because there's more
it's a bigger web isn't it there's more
things that need to come into place
um i don't think it's frustrating in the
sense that
it that we get frustrated with other
people at all it's right
yeah it's just the nature of the the
pipeline isn't it it's all part of the
pipeline
somebody has to be at the end of a
pipeline that is yeah
virtue and nature of a pipeline and it's
it's not us it's audio yeah yeah so
basically everybody poor went out for
the audio team epson chat
they're they're they're the ones with
the biggest struggle but we we
absolutely appreciate them
but we work closely with with them as
well you know like we we've got a good
relationship with the audio guys
um so yeah it's all good well yeah
because
you could do all the work you want to
make a cool thruster but if when p
players get it they just hear this
that's a great point that's a really
good point you know what it's like
sometimes the audio can make an effect
look better
i think i might have said that in the
past but it's it's really true you know
the
the the weapons in particular we did a
big pass on
improving vehicle weapon effects um
through throughout the sort of
latter half of last year and without
darren the audio director
and and his team making the weapon sound
better
it it would have made my life more
difficult so it's it's a great
it's great sort of uh collaboration
process we love darren and phil
and graham and everybody on that team
and and this isn't my attempt to get
them to come back on the show
um i want to add to to what mike set but
we're not
always downstream either um like
in in some cases like some projects
we're actually
the driving team almost um or we're
in quite early that we become a driving
team for example
the weather effects or the planetary
effects that
um we have on the planets right now we
were quite early
um with like starting to add those
things so so you were in charge of
actually
implementing wind and
like we needed the wind for our
effects and uh other teams have started
using the same kind of wind system that
we uh
added because like
if we have it like they they can use it
just as well
right um and there i mean there are
like some other examples like the fire
that we're kind of working on right now
that
like it's again like a system that's
very
vfx heavy but it will
affect quite a lot of gameplay as well
um
yeah um another one is is like
atmospheric pressure was something we
already had but um
like vfx team has been like you like
implemented them on planets gas clouds
um like the the support for plants and
gas glands because
we needed them on like the the pressure
value because it drives a lot of our
effects
um so uh we just added it um on planets
and on gas clouds and and now like a lot
of gameplay systems also use that same
pressure
that we've been adding so
it's it's not like i think it's it's
it's part of our company as well
because we're quite a big vfx team i
think we're kind of like a special place
where we can actually
drive projects as well as the uh
downstream team
that's really well said thank you leo
um since
planets and moons have different
atmospheric composition
do you plan to design different re-entry
vfx
vfx effects based on the gas being
burned and the temperature
it reaches on compression i think it's a
really nice idea
uh it's it it's definitely something
that i think that would be worth
looking into for the future definitely
um
it's i think it's feasible it's
definitely feasible and again probably
leo
be able to talk talk a bit about the the
way that our
that those effects are set up because
again it's it's a great example of
a set of a system that's driving the
effects so
yeah i mean for me it makes a lot of
sense it it's entirely
typical of our game isn't it you know
it's it's it's a
it's a it's a visually nice feature but
it's also gonna
give readability to the player from a
gameplay point of view as well so very
important
visually and and for gameplay too but
yeah
in terms of the setup i i suspect that
that's perfectly feasible
i i actually i don't i don't know if you
remember oh sorry lo go ahead no no no
go go ahead um i i don't actually
i i don't know if you remember um when i
was
working on on the atmospheric entry
effects i actually pitched different
colors
uh based off the that's a very large jug
oh but my camera was turned off they
couldn't see it
um you have uh different i actually
wanted that to be
in the first release but it didn't
really make sense because uh first of
all we needed
um a stable uh visual
state for it but also we didn't have
that many different
atmospheric compositions so anyway the
that idea was
put on the side but yeah as mike said
it's possible
and would look cool yeah
from a technical point of view it's
definitely possible we
do have all the data available on the
ship
to actually trigger those effects um it
would be
kind of more a challenge to to get like
a good setup
that's easy to set up for artists and
that's like systemic again
like we always need everything to be
systemic it's
it's necessary because like we want this
to work on on like
hundreds of planets like all with
different atmospheres so
it's all about the strength curves leo
um maybe color uh maybe size like
nose um but yeah it's it's
um like it's definitely possible
something like that so um for
for us it's like the first step we we
need is this kind of like an
investigation of what
what affects the like what changes would
we have
based on the atmosphere so does it
affect color effect size does it affect
like is it completely different effect
because it's acidic or whatever
um like those kind of things and then
we need to go and or like artists at
least we'll
go and like do pre-production and i
think
mike can tell more about it but um it's
it's like artists will tell us like what
do they want and then we go
and discuss like options of like how we
can implement it
yeah leo just mentioned pre-production
that's a massive part of the vfx
pipeline and it
it's it's really just r d you know it it
by the end if before anyone does any any
effects they have to have done a
pre-production pass
for something really simple or something
that we've done a lot of before let's
just say like a muzzle flash the
pre-production still exists but it's
probably a very small task like
identifying yeah there's an existing
weapon in the game it needs to look like
this
so there you go we take that box we know
what it needs to look like
but for something exploratory like what
leo's
describing it's it really is it's just
it's just going through a process
of understanding what what it could look
like what it needs to do from a gameplay
point of view
is it is it performant is it going to be
just ridiculously complicated to
implement like is it going to be
a year of a programmer's time etc etc
um so yeah lots of lots of exploration
in pre-production
yeah no i will not be jug shamed
on my own show if you want to see my
extra large jug you can turn
tune into my private streams on the
weekend uh
as a follow-up to that one uh with the
shield effects rework coming soon
will we see unique patterns for shield
manufacturers
and a fusion of different patterns
perhaps when mixing shields
they want customized vfx man it's a
it's entirely feasible and it's
definitely something we talked about um
so i think that
the main thing for me is that i i want
to get to a point where the the
the the tech that we've got and the
visuals of rock solid
initially like this this this initial
release it's just the one
it's the one style it does it does what
the the designers needed to do
it looks good it's efficient et cetera
et cetera
but yeah for sure like there's there's
we like to
with all our vfx we like to theme them
we like that we like to
be able to make the effects different
per manufacturer we've done that with
thrusters
for however many years i've been here
nearly nearly seven
um so yeah i think it's perfectly
feasible
we're actually i think jake i'm going to
ask jake a question
i'm going to put him on the spot so like
3d textures
we we might we probably would use we've
talked about using 3d textures
to to to define the shape like to give
some pattern
and i guess i guess that's the kind of
thing where i might go to you
and say hey can we how can we use
houdini to to quickly generate some nice
variety of 3d textures
i'm not asking i just typically i'm not
asking you to do that as a task it's
just a theoretical
question ah this sounds like he's making
work for you jake
i mean i'm not quite sure how how do you
want me to give you
[Music]
um
still a lot of questions about uh uh
quantum entry
um can we expect to see as a third
person
some kind of quantum entry and exit vfx
when another ship jumps in or arrives in
the future
i know this has been this has been a
long talked about things yeah this is
this is a
this is a this is a topic that crops up
all the time
um to be honest like it's something that
design will will regularly remind me
needs to needs to be a thing
and it's all about the setup again so
it's
it's it's to do with the hooks that
we've got from the system from the
underlying system and if
it provides us with the opportunity to
spawn in effect then
then yeah we'll we'll do it um tell you
you did you did a kind of a pitch didn't
you for
for quantum travel improvements just
just just generally so
yeah played a part didn't it
yeah i mean i i like things
to to to to to be clear what's happening
um
there's your jack jared um
so when when ships arrive
in your vicinity um it it would
feel a sound and look so cool if there
was
you know something really punchy there
because it's it's a
you know it's it's an aggressive sort of
action that's happening um so i would
love
uh yeah i mean for me i i love all the
sci-fi tropes of
ships jumping in with like very large
flashes and
yeah i've tried a couple of things
um and i'm hoping to i think i had a
task
to to to actually work on it and then it
disappeared because other things came
into priority but uh yeah we've moved it
around i think yeah
yeah but yeah i mean the the when we
first did quantum traffic because it's
gone through some iterations
and when and i mean the actual
underlying setup the detect
the system itself so when we first did
quantum travel it was it was in some
ways it was a lot more straightforward
it was we just had like very simple
timings like
the spool up happens now then it
initiates and then it stops and
we had all those kind of things but yeah
it was it was primarily
we were primarily concerned with the the
view for the player
doing the qt but yeah hopefully i've not
rambled too much there but yeah we
we acknowledged that that's that's gonna
be a thing
[Music]
um what's the most
impactful vfx that you've done that no
one thinks to ask about
there's a bit of if you do your job
right no one notices in every job
but you know if you could highlight
something what would it be
i'm sure everyone in this chat's got got
something does anyone else want to go
before i start rambling again
um i would just say that the the
conversion work we did
um between from cpu particles to gpu
particles
i think is something that no one really
noticed and nobody really talked about
but it had an incredible
impact on performance just the other day
when i switched
some of the distortion impacts effects
uh
i noticeably felt a
a reduction in sort of this kind of like
a micro lag i don't know like
it wasn't a drop in performance but it
did feel
better and yeah that's not talked about
a lot and the entire team
does does a lot on uh on on for that
work
that's a great shot yeah because yeah a
lot of a lot of our even though we've
had the gpu particle system for a long
time
just for the sheer volume of effects in
our game that there are still quite a
few
cpu ones that we we we want to
eventually replace with gpu
and as taylor said doing that actually
provides
not necessarily so it's slightly
intangible but it provides
it provides a performance boost and
actually
in our game a really small performance
boost for one
one scenario like that if you think
about 20 ships
however many ships all fire in that
weapon the the
the performance gains are big and that
that's a huge
win for the for the player um i've got i
guess i got kind of a
a similar sort of thing i guess but um
we got
so laser projectiles we had a we
want to say we the vfx programmers gave
me a minimum pixel
distance option on on project on the
projectile shader that we use
and what that means is that i can keep
that projectile as long as it's alive
when it's on screen it just keeps it a
minimum amount of pixels
and what that even though that's a
really minor thing seemingly
in the field of battle that was
absolutely invaluable because it meant
that you could still see them
it's just a readability thing it just
meant that in combat
it just made a difference that people
probably wouldn't have really thought
much of
anyone else yeah so as a programmer
it's it's it's a bit different um like
the
the small gains that we do is more for
the artist i would say
it's it's i mean like we do performance
improvements and those kind of things
but
like the small things um like making the
setup easier
or or finding like good formula like um
we have to think wingtip vortices on
ships um it's it's all physically based
and
and as long as like the the planet and
the gas clouds
are set up with pressure and temperature
and humidity combinations
it will work with different combinations
and and it means
less setup for artists so as long as
they make sure the effect is
like set up on the on the ship they
don't have to tweak values of like we
want
this here that's there it's it's been
like a
kind of long process but i think we got
like some good
formulas like physically based formulas
and it's it's quite satisfying
finding those and and making the future
set up for ships and like anything
better for artists and easier
um has anybody ever told you you look
like obi-wan kenobi
no that's the first it's the first that
you've never heard that before
no really not like i've been
compared to another uh youtuber
famous youtuber but but never open
kenobi
can you just say hello there
can you just say hello there can you
just say hello there
hello there oh hello there
how about you were the chosen one you
were the chosen one
this is too much sorry chad's been
having fun with it
so uh that they think you look like
obi-wan kenobi
which is a good thing by the way yeah
yeah yeah i was just going to say that's
that's quite nice it's better with
better than what i get half the time leo
has a very jedi like presence on this
one
i think that's probably what you're in
the room with it's probably what lends
to it
uh it's a diversion uh
gas clouds currently look great from
perspective but once
inside it's very difficult to see their
beauty and volume
feeling more like a thick fog in a
recent video
you were working on uh in a recent video
we saw that uh
you were making them react to sunbeams
and other light sources how is that
going
yeah so for the for the initial gas
cloud release that went into 3.12 we
actually we did have the effects
the interior effects and when i say
interior effects i mean all the kind of
small
high velocity highs of detail noise that
gives you that sense of parallax
we had all that working and it was all
ready to go but unfortunately there were
just some
the some of the hooks like the we were
dependent on the was it it was the
pressure valley wasn't it in
of the gas powered by the room system
that
wasn't quite ready to ship because there
were some knock-ons to the to the actor
status i think um so we had to just
the designers had to just keep the
pressure set to zero um so
we are working on that at the moment
getting that back in
everyone in this call actually is is
been working on that i mean jacob
yourself like you you
you provide the the method of creating
the gas cloud in the first place
don't you for the artist or you you'll
integral to that process
um so yeah um
i'm losing my throat here but yeah we're
working on it and it's all it's all
it's all happening it's all going quite
well i think tayo and leo
got together and added a really nice uh
new feature
which is do you want to talk about that
the collision
effect um yeah sure um
it's uh basically in inside the gas
clouds
some of them are themed differently some
of the themes are
um are like uh
[Music]
asteroid field or mining um
themed and you would expect little rocks
or micro asteroids flying about
and when the ship the ships go quite
fast so when they do go quite fast you'd
expect those
items to interact with the ship so the
rocks would
interact with the ship's hull and and
break apart as you
fly through the gas clouds um
yeah um there'll also be some
metal bits in some cases but
yeah all of those will interact with
your ship and it'll feel really cool
and audio actually are hopefully going
to
pizzazz it up and and add that extra
layer
but yeah it's coming along looks really
cool like
i'm quite excited about it and the cool
thing
like from my side was that it's it's
using existing tech for the
atmospheric entry so it's it's using the
sdf um it's it's
using the same kind of system for
dynamically placing the emitter so that
it follows the direction of the ship
and kind of it was like
a relatively quick thing to add on our
side that
i think will give a lot of like extra
nice like environment
uh yeah okay um
we got about we got about nine minutes
left uh
it's been well over a year if not longer
since the extremely cool heat haze
effect on demar disappeared completely
no matter if in cold or really hot
conditions are there plans on bringing
this effect back to daymar
yes there are um i want to make a bad
joke about it being hot not cool
but yeah i mean it was something i think
it was just something the
the actual effect itself is a is a
fairly simple one but i think
i think as part of various amazing
improvements to the planet tech
itself i think that it kind of just got
lost in the way even being completely
honest
um but yeah the the creation of the
effect dead straightforward we just need
to
figure out the the appropriate way to to
hook them back up again
and and actually it will be it'll be
systemic
to use that word again because it will
be you know hooked up to the actual
uh the the planetary data the the
temperature itself
uh and probably the the humidity i guess
leo
did that play a part um potentially i
don't know
i'd have to look it up um yeah what what
exactly
makes it do that but that's what i like
about leo so leah like again like i just
asked a
a a simple well not a simple question i
ask for something and leo goes and
researches
the actual real world um
criteria for something for something
occurring so
then we get it all we get it all in the
game
speaking of real world criteria for
stuff
uh how are the directional rain and snow
effects going in regards to wind
direction
uh when this player strafe sideways in
inclement weather the water
seems to still flow as if they're moving
forward regardless of which direction
they're facing
happening there it should i think
i think i'm allowed to say it should be
working it should be like the the the
setup that we
created for the for those directional
effects was
incredibly complex actually on
the intricate setup and it is actually
taking the direction
and the wind strength and direction
isn't it leo yeah
yeah so we're using the movement
direction the interaction
the gravity i think as well um
there like it might be a bug where like
the
we're simulating the rain wraps on the
flat plane
and the plane is then kind of wrapped
around
or like it needs to be wrapped on the
different faces of the
the canopy and and like the the glass
so either there is something wrong with
like the uvs which
map the flat plane to the mesh or
it's one of the edge cases where where
the
like because it's simulated on a flat
plane we can't really
get all the direction perfectly um
like covered and that might be a nice
case so it
like we have to see the ship itself and
see
like how it behaves and maybe send it to
our team to fix up the uvs or
yeah it could be a few things yeah would
you when you didn't with that some of
the some of the ships would would
probably provide more
more extreme edge cases than others as
well
but yeah it should be working like for
most chips in most cases
report uh ships that where it's not
working to the issue council
possible uh
let's see if we can get one more quantum
drive question here because there's been
a lot
uh can the current currently the quantum
drive friction effect
at the front of the ship is a
pre-calculated particle effect
are you planning to convert it to a more
dynamic effect like the new atmospheric
re-entry one
yeah yeah again i think earlier on we
were talking about
probably making use of sound distance
fields for
the eventual rework of the quantum
travel effects and
it would this would be a great use case
for it if you think about the change we
made to the atmospheric entry
effects with with sds versus the old one
just think of the same kind of thing
with the with the quantum travel
i'm not saying visually but but with the
the uh
the use of the the shape of the ship and
the the more authentic looking
interaction
yeah so okay let's see what else
uh why don't the carrick's engines have
heat waves
the visual heat that the engine flames
create like the hammerhead or so many
other ships
so i saw this question and i was i as i
was looking at the question i loaded up
the editor
and did a little bit of digging into it
it's my favorite ship
mike it's a beautiful shape uh i was a
bit confused because we should have
i thought it was a bug initially i just
thought oh maybe it's just not
not working as expected but it just
looks like the settings needed a bit of
tweaking
so that's something i started playing
around with actually i need to make sure
i've got that file checked out because
i made some changes yesterday to it to
get the heat age back again so yeah that
should be that should be coming
in in a future patch nice
um let's see
okay let's um so i'm
trying to get more in from the live here
um
do you have any more types of space
anomalies like your work on gas clouds
planned
comets black holes anything you're ready
to
chat about
um i i mean
black holes i don't i'm not not sure
that we've done
any research into that so far but our
comments have come up in conversations
for sure
i think when we started to show the the
uh the
the atmospheric burn up tail took a
really nice video where there's a
there's a ship passing through the
atmosphere but it's right off in the
distance
and it just looks like a burning up
meteor and you were probably in it jared
but it was in one of the weekly updates
and
immediately ian was talking about i mean
yeah let's get let's be great to get
loads of comments coming to you
and then the designer's like yeah but
then it's going to land somewhere
and then it could be like a new location
and there's all these gameplay
opportunities so um everybody was
excited except the level designers
like everybody was excited that you
could just see you just see the level
designers like me just like
the guys who've got to yeah make it make
it a reality
perhaps the the jump gates the the the
wormhole jump gates would be a space
anomaly
right that'll happen at some point yeah
yeah all right last question gentlemen
uh what's
a future system slash process slash
mechanic
not yet implemented in the game that
you're most excited
excited uh to work on
definitely fire for me um
fire because it's terrifying
but it's also really exciting because of
the not not really even to do with the
visuals but just the the gameplay
opportunities that it brings um and
the sheer game-changing nature of it and
how it how all
departments crg needs to come together
to really
take advantage of it but we've i'm
pretty sure we've shown
some some videos in you know from from
our updates
showing the potential for the
possibilities uh
yeah leo obviously you you in particular
but the vfx programmers are
creating some amazing setups
yeah well of course that's it's the big
project
i'm i'm currently working on so it's
it's
it's the same answer for me like um
but yeah it's it's it's quite nice like
uh we've we've shown like demo
and some videos on ic i think uh but
currently we're we're kind of working on
getting it working with
the rest of the game so before we had
like a separate kind of like
prototype um and and now that we're kind
of
implementing it and integrating it with
the rest of the game there are some kind
of nice
situations that kind of already pop up
and like problems to solve so yeah it's
it's
yeah i've played i've laid off i've laid
off on showing them this quarter i i i
show
that they were my thematic through line
for quarter four
of last year and this quarter has been
has been the outposts
you know following them each week so i
try to i try to lay off so that's that
you know some of the
some of the surprise can still be
preserved for players to discover
in the game it's some i think some
sometimes people think the job is to
spoil
everything in the game in our videos and
just to show everything but we do
actually
attempt to balance that stuff and
preserve some stuff
uh for discovery for players like xeno
threat
so you know how hard it was not to talk
about xeno threat for six months
um all right gentlemen that's it that's
the show
you made it thank you so much for taking
the time to be here uh uh
mike uh leo teo and jake
uh thank you so much um we are gonna
we're gonna raid we haven't raided
anybody in a while and i'm getting a
message from from tyler here that we're
gonna attempt to raid somebody right now
they have no idea it's coming it's a
star citizen streamer who's broadcasting
right now on twitch
their name is subliminal subliminals tv
um uh that they seem pretty cool i
watched a stream with them one time
a couple months ago they were working on
becoming a full-time streamer if they
could
so i have no idea what they're doing
because i've been here doing this show
so
uh be sure to wipe your feet before you
walk in the door
uh behave yourselves and say um
and and and when you get there in your
best ob one voice
say hello there on behalf of my friend
leo
we'll see y'all next week everybody take
care
you
