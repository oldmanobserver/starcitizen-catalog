## Transcript

hello everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live
uh radar and scanning q a i'm your host
jared huckabee
and if you've never seen star citizen
live before somebody has in every show
somebody's first show
is where we take about an hour out of
the end of our week and we chat with
some of our developers
about a topic that's usually currently
in development
now if you watched last night's uh uh
semi late kind of very late episode of
inside star citizen
uh we introduced some of the changes
that are upcoming to the
radar scanning and ping systems we
thought we'd follow that up today with a
more in-depth conversation with two
members of our vehicle tech team so
let's introduce them now
we've got sean tracy and mark aban how
you guys doing
good good got coffee ready to roll
yeah so uh every show is somebody's
first show i know you guys have been on
these things forever and ever and ever
but let's take a minute
introduce yourselves tell people who you
are what you do for starter citizen mark
we'll start with you
sure i'm mark abend i'm one of the
league gameplay programmers at the
la studio and i primarily focus
on ship technology and ship gameplay
stuff
i work on ships nothing but ships and
all the ships
and do you still bug smash i bug smash
all day every day
i just don't do it with videos anymore
it took a lot in my head
i'm playing it like when you work do you
still do the narration just to yourself
while you work
yeah sometimes i do it in meetings and
sean has to tell me to be quiet
sean that never happens
sean who tells uh mark aidman to be
quiet who are you and what else do you
do
right um so sean tracy i'm the tech
director of content at cloud imperium
games
uh fancy title that really just covers
three different jobs one of the one of
the big ones and the reason i'm here is
uh
directing alongside john crew rich tyra
the
vehicle and actor pillars so that's
where you know vehicle tech team is part
of uh and because it's over in the la
time zone uh you know i'm pretty
one-to-one with uh with mark day-to-day
as we go
uh then on top of that is the tech art
and tech animation directorship as a
department
and then is the game direction for
theaters war arena expander and all that
kind of stuff
so just a couple things and just a few a
few
all right so today's show is about radar
and scanning
again we had a short little primer in
isc yesterday if you
haven't seen it you know be sure to
check that out uh we're gonna cover
a little bit about what we discussed
yesterday
and then go into more detail let's start
things off with a basic explanation for
for folks here
um what is radar ping
scanning what what are the what do they
do how are they different from another
why do we need all three
uh help us to understand what it is that
we're talking about today
sure um sean did you want me get this or
you got it
no go ahead okay great cool uh so
um radar ping and scan are kind of like
um
bundled together but they're kind of
different concepts
we think of radar as what you currently
see
um within your range it's your passive
contacts you know you're flying around
and you see a ship or you're flying
around you see a station and
there's information you see it's
appearing you see
the ui indicating that the thing's there
whereas
ping is more of i can't see something
i'll ping out and maybe uncover stuff
now
that could either be something very very
far away or something's
heavily influenced by an ambient
signature so you can't quite see it
without
a little bit of help the only downside
of
doing that kind of burst to kind of
seymour is you kind of reveal that you
have done it
so if i were to ping out and go find
sean sean would know that i pinged
but now i can maybe see sean and then
scanning is more of
what information could i get about that
contact
so a common flow is i could ping out
i find um some like little blobs
and maybe i could scan it and cover that
oh there's something interesting that i
want to
go into that blob so i get closer and it
appears as a contact
and i re maybe multiple contacts and i
could scan those to get
other information so it's a way of
expressing
in the the world what's happening and
maybe show some interest
that may want the player to go toward
that direction or avoid that direction
all right now the vehicle tech team
works on like these core features the
the these broad scopes these sets of
tools that then
you know other designers and stuff will
go in and then choose from pick from
play from
when they're developing their ships i
bring this up because as usual we put a
thread up on spectrum where we collect
questions ahead of time
and we'll be collecting questions from
the live chat here today uh
questions about specific ships are
generally the purview of
ship designers and the specific ship
teams
you guys create the radar and scanning
toolbox
that they then pick from choose from and
they choose
this ship is going to be this good at
this this ship is going to be
you know this bad at this so questions
about specific
vehicles or spacecraft is basically not
the domain of your
team so i wanted to get that out there
because there were a lot of questions
that's correct well this should do this
and well this one you can make all the
answers you want they just won't be
accurate yeah um yeah so you you know
that there
you know a little detail within there
too is that you know the vehicle tech
team wasn't always the vehicle tech team
that that only really happened last year
um yeah last year or so and actually
uh scanning and radar was one of the
last um
features and it gets developed like a
feature and this is just something
internal production he was
uh that we deal with now the the
intention of the vehicle tech team is
that yes it's exactly as you described
which is
we're working on systems rolling out
systems to content teams design teams
whatever that is
um but this one so happens to be an
all-encompass
feature it's not about marking up every
single one of the ships or marking up
the entirety of the levels or or the um
or the space stations or however else um
it is still about bringing the system
but
it is one of the the last anyways uh you
know
we would call it like a tier one feature
like a tier one team running it through
like a feature team
um just because it is a lot of work when
it is because mark has to not only be a
lead programmer he has to
be a product owner at the same time he's
got to chase around a whole bunch of
different teams so
that's just the evolution of vehicle
tech team and not to despair
while today's show is about all
ship scanning and all ship radar in
general
we do have a show specifically about the
ships
themselves coming up as part of flea
week and that's just in like
two or three weeks i'm not a calendar so
it's coming up soon so so save your
questions about specific ships
uh we got that show coming in a couple
weeks but this show is all about the
broad existence of radar and scanning
what our plans are for the future
so let's go straight to the thread here
we
allowed people to submit questions and
then vote up which ones they wanted to
see answered most
there's been a lot of talk about how
we're unifying
the the the the radar the scanning some
aspects of it between ships and
fps uh when we are on foot will we get
the radar data from our nearby ships
pushed to our individual fps huds
so that's probably a two-parter question
first part i'm just going to iterate
more on the
radar technology so when vtt took
this on we did have a lot of radar
and scanning functionality and even ping
but it was
a lot of systems that kind of built up
from different designers and different
features
and when we took this on we wanted to
unify it
across the entire game so it could be
used anywhere by any designer
to facilitate different those original
mechanics
passive it's on your radar ping you go
out and find it and scan you get
information
whether that's a mission whether that's
on foot or whether that's
on a spaceship or even on both so
because of that star citizen you are not
just a spaceship
you are a person and you have a group of
people
and in the document for our radar
scanning we do facilitate
how and why we want to share information
now the technology to do that is there
but it's not available yet for this
current
iteration the primary focus is
for this upcoming patch will be for
ships because
we're going to iterate on developing
this tech basically replace the old
system with the new one
and then add on extra features
throughout patches
so this tech will allow us to put it on
to other things like players and on
ships but the current one will not be
exposed to players into an up and coming
patch
and one of those primary things is how
do we get that information
from a player on foot to a ship or vice
versa
now going back to radar ping and scan
radar again is what's on your you know
what's near you and what information we
could
perceive as the the person playing now
if i'm on a ship
i'm actually going to see different
signatures even different contacts
because it's based on the ship radar
you know if i have a small little radar
i might see certain
like i'll go with the prospector it's
made for finding mining things
so if i get on foot my
fps radar might depending upon my
customized
loadout might see different things what
my ship was seeing
so it also depends on what the player
has his loadouts on both the ship
and on foot are that determine what he
sees from his radar and ping
now if you do line up both of them then
you'll probably see
similar information but again your ship
is going to have a much more powerful
system than one that's on foot
you know your ship might be able to see
something far away on the planet but you
go on foot you're not going to see it
i mean unless you have some nuclear
power plant i don't think your radar
will be able to see things
so that far away now your scan
information
that is something we're looking at on
how to send an information to and from
the player
because that is something you can
transfer reliably because your scanner
is meant to
just technically you could have
different things determine what you're
you know if i have a medical scanner and
i have a mining scanner they'll uncover
different things but where we
store it is something that the player
could look at
at any point in time once we unlock that
information through a ui
so radar-wise it depends on your loadout
scanning wise depends on your loadout
but what information you uncover from
your scanner
in a later upcoming patch you'll be able
to access that
either on foot or on the ground
hopefully that
answers that question in a bigger way
yeah there's and one other point to it
and it's a little higher level it's just
um when we when we re invigorated the
tasks around
scanning and getting that wrapped up and
and completely done
as well as squadron requirements uh one
of the big parts and
and again one of the big benefits to be
able to direct the two different pillars
the vehicle and and the actors is that
we got to design this together
um so what we didn't want was a whole
separate
fps radar system that just has no
you know no ability to cross talk with
with what happens in the ship
um ship scanning because ultimately you
know we're both um
and we should be able to transition the
data uh between both
so um it was a nice thing to be able to
design this together um and it just so
happens that
the ship stuff you know was was
obviously a little further along
um in terms of uh the amount of time
that's been spent on it over the years
so we were able to get that done first
and then we wait for the fps and
everything's
coming up behind it uh we've been
talking
in in general uh almost since the
beginning of star citizen's development
about this notion of when you're
exploring
you know when you're out in the great
unknown and you're scanning and you're
looking
you're looking to discover things like
jump points or
wrecks or you know anything else that
can be found the idea that
you can save that data and then
transmit it to somebody else probably
for a healthy amount of credits
is that still on the table is that still
our intention
that is percent on the table and still
our intention
but that's not something you'll see for
314.
uh now we talked about you know
avoiding the questions specifically
about you know this ship the terrapin or
whatever
but in general uh will ships design
specifically for scanning or tracking
purposes and that's anything from a
terrapin to a
hornet tracker to you know a carrick or
whatever
have more sensitive radars and ping
tech available to them they can
so um a lot of the work that we've done
is to talk with designers on what
information they would like to have
across different ships even on foot
and what type of upgrade paths you would
want radars and scanners to have
and a lot of those type of things
usually amounted to
different type of signatures the
strengths at which you can see them at
even the strengths of how resistant they
are to ambient even the
types so we've unlocked a lot of
information and a lot of ways to
categorize information
so that designers could make more
stronger radar more stronger ping or
more stronger
scanners or unlock specific information
we've also incorporated different ways
that we could potentially unlock players
to filter out that stuff
but it still depends on what the
designer said that this particular radar
can do
or this particular scanner can do
you but sorry yeah i did to kind of
support that a little bit is you know
there there there is now
three separate sort of functions of of
our radar ping stance
system that are all able to be balanced
independently per ship per item
um but then you've also in addition to
that you've got
those three separate ones then you've
got three different signature types that
again
you could have a scanner better at
detecting ces you could have a better
scanner for em you could have better
scanner for ir so
there's a lot of um there's a lot of
designer control
now um and it basically gives them a ton
of tools to
make you know all the stealth kind of
gameplay or really all the electronic
warfare that we've been expecting to
have within star citizen
uh work as as as expected and as
intended and with that we've been also
in talks with different um balance
teams on what values these things do and
how they
interfere with each other so that we
could get the electronic warfare we
could get that stealth gameplay
you know we always i keep going back to
this into different examples
sean really likes that idea that you
have a big
ship and you can maybe see it and you
get a little bit closer and also
there's a bunch of contacts because that
big ship was hiding all the smaller ones
so you know an upgrade path could be
that you have a radar that's
more sensitive to seeing those contacts
further out than another one because
it's
ambient volume it could pierce through
it
more than another type of radar the
downside could be more power just
depends what design wants
i just want goose to talk to me talk to
me it's not one pair
it's two pair right uh no i always found
that to be great but
it is such a you know it it's obvious
but but it takes some doing uh
especially when you've got three
different
sort of signature types how you call
them how you actually merge them
and uh in the end that the challenge is
how you balance them all um
is is you know the first time we even
took a look at it what the hammerhead
was you know had more
more signature than an idris and then
you know
if you were beside the hammerhead you
would never get seen you know even at
you know 10 meters or so so um yeah yeah
i was inverted
uh will turning off all systems
allow us to get close to enemies without
being picked up by passive scanning
it's a good question because it kind of
it kind of depends
it really depends one on the ship um so
so what's happening within that chip
even what's inside of it if it's cargo
that's actually emitting ir or whatever
that that could
that could cause some problems or
whatnot uh if it's not shielded you know
whatever
um but it's also considered that there's
always uh cross-section
so cross-section is almost a visual
thing um so
if you're getting up to 100 meters for
sure you obviously see it
um and if you can see it you can
probably see you now if you're behind
them different story right you're
probably not going to get called out
but you may be picked up from ces in
terms of your radar so you are
you know you're going to want to try to
include yourself so if you're
approaching to zero to 100 meters
behind asteroids and stuff yeah you're
going to get it right up to him and he's
going to have no idea you're there
but i don't know how you're maneuvering
with all your stuff turned off you know
so
yeah uh it really depends um but all
those tools
are are there now and and you'll it
you'll feel
you'll know they're there um it'll be
pretty obvious i think
we actually have a test level that uh
kirk tome was
messing with where there's a um
kind of like gas cloud that has high em
and ir emittance
so if something flies in there you're
not gonna see it but if you get close
enough
if your radar detects cross-section
you'll be able to see it
so you know it really depends on what
the other player's
radar is and what your mission is doing
to determine what
you can see and how end of your ship
like yes when we're talking about cross
section it really is
cross section like if you are horizontal
to a guy versus
being top down your cross section is way
less like way way less
it is because it's um the shield
technology that
we're using is based off sdf stuff from
physics
and the beauty of that is it gives us a
more accurate description of
cross-section on the overall surface
area
so we're 100 using the physical
representation of that ship
so if you have one that transforms the
different ways or even animates you're
going to get different cross-section
so like on the hammer head if you look
at it like horizontally the cross
section is a lot smaller than if you
flipped it upside down
then it's loud yeah that's super loud
but but a gladius being a good you know
decent
uh fighter um like that coming at you
knows first
it has a very small cross section um so
i may not
pick it up that's why the question is
like it really depends depends
but that's what's so cool about it
that's you know again that's that's the
system we wanted to bring in here
that's why we make everything systemic
what that depends
we also wanted to add some stuff onto
the ui to kind of help you with that
so one of the things on there is the
what your signatures are admitting
versus the ambient levels that are
happening so it kind of gives you an
idea of
how well seen you are versus what's
happening in the environment
the best way i describe it is like a
thief visibility meter you know
yeah for the um
siphon filter maybe that's really cool
um
yeah it's got a little visibility so
you've got that ambient level so
like a good example and this is more for
fps because they have the db
signature so like sound um but if you're
in a room that has a generator running
it's super loud or whatever that ambient
sound is going to be like full bar
and as you run your ambience going to
move up and down like this as as it is
but it's probably staying below
so that means you're stealth you're not
detectable easily anyways
up or passively from somebody else's
radar but could they
focus scan you could they ping you yeah
they could still do all that kind of
stuff
but mark you mentioned ui i wanted to
throw out
some notice the for folks who have
already seen the segment that aired
yesterday
the ui is not finished it's still in
progress
everything that we show in isc is still
a work in progress
if we waited for everything to be final
art you'd have
one episode the week before a patch went
live and that's all you'd ever get
so always keep in mind that when you
watch something on isc
especially when it's earlier in the
quarter that you're looking at a very
very work in progress
and so it's an interesting thing with
the ui
is that ui that we actually shown in
that video
for the the scanner and the ping is
actually not the ship ui
we have a whole new spectrum of
ship ui that we want to do for scanning
and
radar that we just not ready to deliver
yet
so we're actually utilizing the fps
scanning ui so you actually get a
glimpse of what's to come
in our ships now
tell your friends amuse your enemies
everything in isc
is very work in progress
all right uh as a follow-up question
from the chat we talked about
you know we're still intending to make
the data collected
through scanners and stuff you know
shareable with with other vehicles
uh have we started working on how
like like that system like how that's
actually going to be are we talking like
physical data
data chips is it is it uh
i think we got to beat beat to death the
the design of that and i know tony very
specifically is very very keen to
to talk through that end and to work
that design out so i wouldn't say
much there um in terms of the system
though yeah definitely uh
the the system itself we've got a
basically a data bank of objects that
can be stored
because it's short of you know selling
it as an item or or
you know giving it to other players or
whatnot uh we've also got to do a couple
other things
even before that that that will lend
itself to it so like the first one is
being able to share
uh contacts and all that kind of stuff
within your ship to just other people in
your ship like a gunner
or something like that so number one we
gotta do that number two we gotta be
able to share stuff to party um you know
like if you got a friend in the party
you got whatever
um we want to make sure that we're kind
of going the direction and
and to use a sort of a battlefield term
uh they called it squad site
uh but it's basically like you know
everybody in the same squad can kind of
see the same stuff they're sharing radar
targets um
and how the system kind of deals with
that because you know you may be good at
detecting this but
this guy's better at detecting this i
think it's super cool because actually
the party can be laid out in such a way
that
you've got a ship that's really really
good at getting cs you've got another
one that's better at im there's another
one that's going to em and then there's
another one
that's actually you know the the loudest
signature in your group so it's actually
clouding you know the rest of you guys
being stealth together
so i i love that there's that dynamic
but we've got to get there
and then once we've got that cool then
then we'll package that up and put it in
a shop and
maybe we do something about it but i'm
sure tony will want to talk through the
actual design of that course before the
cart
uh yeah victor tramp's like jared we
know
i'm like i read the comments some people
still need to be told
all right uh moving on will radar
or scanning have its own interactive mfd
yes on um so
radar i know some of the bigger ships
there's been
ideas of having like a radar globe and
then being able to
interact with what your actual radar is
doing there's different designs on that
but the one that i'm more familiar with
is the scanning mfd
we've been going through it i'll back
pedal and say this is not something for
314 this is something that's up and
coming
um we've been in talks with ui and other
teams on
what that mfd is going to do and what
information should it have
so going back to scanning it you're
going to unlock a bunch of information
you're going to
you know if i lock mine they or go to a
mine able and i
find that it has a gold or if i go to
sean's ship and i find that it has a
weapon or even gold
that information gets stored in my
object data bank on the ship
that mfd's goal is to show
you that information so if i go to
scan a ship i'll get the nice ui and
i'll see all the information there
but if sean's gone i can't look at that
information again
hence the mfd the mfd is supposed to be
that window
of memory of what i scanned in the past
so the good news is we in the object
databank we have that whole underlying
system where we actually save that
information there we just don't have a
way for the player to uncover it
the only way you could uncover it if
sean comes back and you try to rescan
them then we show all the information
that was there
so the scan ui is going to be that
housing of
i scanned a bunch of things maybe i
could look at what was there in history
and even maybe have a way of
transferring it somehow
because that's going to be the ultimate
thing is what do i do with it do i
bring it with me on foot do i transfer
it to another party or do i sell it or
can someone
i i think calex had the idea of another
designer on vtt
he wants to steal it i could go and scan
it sneak aboard my ship and steal it so
why not it's on the ship we just have to
have ways of accessing it
there's a ton of ideas that we want to
have fun with
uh there's a couple of the questions in
the chat is about
uh are about wanting the co-pilot or
another seat in a multi-crew ship be
able to do the scanning
and stuff like that and that just comes
down to operator modes right
yes and no um so each of the seats
as of right now they could they have
their own
operator um sub-context so
if i'm piloting i could be flying and if
someone guys in the back with a
scanner on this turret he could be in
the scan mode now if he scans something
it gets saved into the ship's data bank
and what's cool about that is if um me
and sean are in a cut list
he's scanning someone and i'm in combat
shooting and flying
whatever information he unlocks i'll see
it too
and this is there in 314 like the
whatever
everyone in the same ship in the same
seats
the scan information is shared across
the entire ship
so it's it's you could have buddies that
just scan everything and everything
go for it right it's all about making
sure that information gets to everybody
else that's on the show yes
a lot of uh information to send received
to different
people and folks who will be learning
more about operator modes
and how that affects multi crew next
week on ise
uh can we please have the functionality
to choose or filter what we actually
scan for
good news um good news
so scanner-wise that's still
in a discussion of how much the players
can actually have control over but
design-wise they're designed to set up
to be medical information or
law information that determines what you
unlock
there's still discussion on what to
allow players to filter out in that scan
mode
radar we actually did a lot of back-end
fundamental stuff to allow
players now there's no ui so you won't
be able to access this 314
but the foundation because remember
vehicle tech we build the foundation of
stuff
is there and we have
a way for players to turn on and off
certain signatures even turn off certain
contact types
one of the discussions we've had and
seen across the community too
is they want to be able to turn off
certain contact types because you get
the portals there and there's like a
billion
turrets well why not allow you to turn
it off or have it off by
default and then you could turn it on so
behind the scenes designer set up what
kind of contacts you can see
and the player can then opt in on which
ones he wants to have
we just need to have a
ui to expose that information maybe that
could be the radar mfd
it really depends how in-depth we want
to get it but the functionality
behind the scenes again is there
it's a common refrain the the ui is one
of the only
uh well one of the few departments that
touch every single aspect of the game so
they are always in incredibly high
demand
uh so well they're
very vital because they you know every
aspect is how
requires ui oh yeah every
everything um are you going to change
the awful cube scanning visual
and making
[Laughter]
so good news right go ahead
good news is um we actually had the
graphics and vfx teams help out concept
new ideas of how we want to have this
blob
so we did get rid of the box i'm sorry
the box is gone
and it got replaced with more of um
fuzziness that there's some object
within there because the whole idea of
pain is that we don't know what's there
or where it all of it is it's more of a
general area there's
something here or a bunch of things here
and you don't know what it is it
requires you to
either focus more ping so you can reveal
contacts or get closer
but the idea is just you know there's
something there
so the ui i'm sorry the vfx all got
changed
now we wanted to move the
vfx to be more on the player's lens to
indicate that it's more of a
system that's happening and relaying the
information to you
on the 2d because it's not a 3d in the
world
effect that happens but the old
effect was kind of 3d now
we didn't quite get all of that there
because there's some stuff we want to do
with the
player ping and radar so we kind of have
a hybrid right now
where it's still in the 3d world but it
looks like what we're going towards
with that on lens vfx so
we did get rid of the box it is still in
the 3d
but we want to move it more into the 2d
so it overlays on top of things
you know one of the complaints we've
always seen too is you you ping out
and it's you can't see the box because
the mountains blocked it
well we want to get rid of that so that
it's mostly on the ui so you go okay
there's something there you just have to
fly towards it
so we're getting there and we're
improving the effects and
as jared said earlier this is not final
we're continuing to develop the vfx so
when you guys
see it please put in your comments
because i'm sure we will take your
feedback and make modifications as it
goes
but for 314 it's a hybrid
to get us where we want to go yeah and
uh
like what you'll see and you know mark
described it really is
is is uh depending on the distance
depending on the signal of the thing
it'll be wider or more narrow it's meant
to be resinging in
that's kind of the thing you know
there's something there you just don't
know what it is you don't even know how
it's shaped you just
you have this you have a blob of a bunch
of different um
meshes that that it looks like and the
closer you get the more it resolves and
then the closer you get to that
you actually get a contact and so so
basically if you're coming into a system
and you're you're willing to kind of
give away your position because if you
if you hit paying that that pretty much
is going to notify everybody that gets
hit by the ping that they've been hit by
a ping so it's like walking into a room
and going hello
and then somebody way off in the side
goes hello
and you're like okay they're over there
and but that's the whole idea with this
is that
there's this broad phase ping then you
have passive radar as you get closer
you've resolved to contact then you scan
to get the info that
that is the loop i'm going to send those
two wave files to fill pure small wood
and see if he can't
replace the audio that the pings make
with that x please do
at least in game dev uh
we talked a lot about uh a ship radar
and scanning because that's
what you know what's coming with 314 fps
radar
and stuff will follow shortly after uh
will fps radar be able to discover
harvestables mine-ables what will it be
able to discover
what can you tell us that pretty much
goes back to
you know what designers want to set up
different scanners and radars to be
uh i have a feeling we're gonna the
first you know when you first get the
system up and running you kind of want
to expose
everything and then you want to decrease
it down and make different variants
to indicate different upgrade paths so
that's kind of what we're doing for the
ships right now
so all the ships are going to have
basically the similar radar and scanning
and then
different ones will get exposed and
broken out to be stronger
and more flexible on what they can do
because now the system allows it
so i imagine the same thing is going to
happen with
fps now fps
doesn't have as many variations
as ships are there's dozens of ships and
they each have different roles and goals
so
they're going to have a lot more complex
items that determine how you scan
radar whereas fps one we might have a
few dozen
and over time more of them come out
so the initial ones will probably
um allow you to do the same gameplay
loop now
whereas you can scan mindable rocks and
you could
ping them out and find them and then i'm
sure there will be upgrade paths
that the mining team or even fps
team will decide to branch out and or
restrict other ones
to focus more on this a goal because i
i mean there's you can make um a scanner
or radar more focused on bounty hunting
versus mining
having one to do both is more of a
gateway to
make the branching paths work yeah
um and to expand a tiny bit uh
on the harvestables the mineables um
the whole intention with this system and
a big part of the the changes and what
it took as long as it did was it needed
to be
uh designer friendly enough that it was
an arbitrary component that we can add
to
any entity um so like if we want to just
make a box have a crazy em ir db
whatever uh we just set it on the entity
it's um it's it's all very
straightforward as far as a designer is
concerned um sorry you hear me
yeah yeah she wants to do scanning um
so we could just add these uh components
on these arbitrary uh
ones and it's all up to us uh what that
signature is and how strong that is and
what entities uh get them so
it's nice because again for squadron
things like this you can have mission
components or
mission entities can have these uh you
can add them to
pretty much anything i want you to know
you had a wonderful opportunity for a
cat scan joke and you didn't take it
and oh i missed it oh and i will be
bringing that up at your annual review
yeah fair enough uh to go on more with
what sean was describing um you know in
the past that we had that
xeno event we had a little bit of radar
scanning
um it was mostly tried to hook it up to
an existing system that didn't quite
support it
and designers got really far but the new
system
will be a lot more flexible so if we
were to go down that path again
they could relay more information
and unlock block the mission better
um based on what information you get and
how quickly you get based on your radar
or
your scanner that you have so the
designers now have a lot more
open-endedness of what
information they want to give the
players and especially once we have more
branching paths
that determines what information you get
so
it's cool because if you
have a medical scanner maybe if you scan
this thing for a mission you're going to
uncover a different
path than if someone has a bounty hunter
scanner
now these aren't real scanners right now
but it's the idea
of what design can do with them for
their missions is exciting
okay um
[Music]
will scanning ever be skill or knowledge
based
rather than just holding a button
yes and no so
we've gone through different ideas of
what it means to be
a skill based and there's some ideas to
get it to there
but what we wanted to focus on is again
getting it to working where everyone
knows how it works
and once we get to that level then we
can maybe add
extra things that make a skillful player
unlock information
better i don't know what that means yet
because it's still ongoing discussions
of
what and how we can make it more skilled
based
but one of the things that we're
bringing into it to kind of bring that
gameplay into there is scanning is now
tied to the signatures and the detection
of an object
so if you have a ship far away
that's like on the edge of on your radar
and you scan it
you may not get all the information
about that object unless you get closer
just because the emissions that it's
making
and it is off the edge that you can't
quite
see it really good so you could see
sean has you can see a ship but maybe
you can't see his contents
and you have to sneak up on him to make
your
um signatures not too far out so you
could scan him to see if he has anything
better
so there is a bit of emergent gameplay
that comes out of there but the whole
process itself
um skill based is still ongoing on what
that means and how we could
deliver it to a player and again
we're focusing on getting um
the basic system there and we'll modify
it as we go
a lot of it's too is we'll watch what
players do and maybe add different
things for different skill sets
yeah i think there's a couple still a
couple layers in there that that that do
have
there's a bunch of player agency now um
and and whether or not you want to call
that skill or not
it really depends situationally what it
is uh but you know they can focus again
on it they'll know what they
interference is according to the signal
of the
the scan target so again if you you've
got a lot of interference you're going
to want to focus more and
that's again a little bit of a skill
you've got to know to do that um and if
you don't know how to do that
you're going to take that much longer to
scan so that's just speaking of the
scanning independently but
like just again the whole electronic
warfare suite there's plenty of skill
involved
um and a lot of it has to do with just
situational awareness and knowing
yourself
right checking the ambient levels am i
stealth am i not stealth
has somebody pinged me have i ping
somebody else do they know where i am
you know all those sort of layers of it
um is the little cat and mouse kind of
gameplay that i think we want out of
this
and the skill i guess out of that too is
you know if you design your ship to be
less emission based and you're aware of
how well those emissions can go
determines how well you could sneak up
on someone and scan them
to relay that information back or just
go all
hands on board and try to take over that
ship but if you have a ship like a
hammerhead that's emitting something
crazy you're not going to be able to
sneak up on someone
because you're you're just loud not with
that attitude
uh but it's what it's what chris likes
about all of this right it's all about
preparedness to go
to the thing that you're gonna go to and
then and then adapting in this situation
but it is the
the forward thinking and a bit the
agency that you have to make those
decisions on the way in
uh we talked earlier uh in the show mark
about
uh kirk and his text level uh with the
gas cloud that has all the uh
em interference and stuff like that um
do we know
i realize this is a question for the
environment team and not for you but i'm
just gonna i'm gonna ask because folks
in chat are asking
do we have an idea of when that stuff
might actually make it into the
persistent universe
jump from a test level to um
hopefully soon tm so what
known ambience has a direct imp just
well there's two different types of
ambience
so there's ambience that a bigger ship
in fears onto a smaller ship or
something bigger emissions and fears
onto a smaller missions and that will
never
100 bleed out the emissions it's more of
a
modifier so that you could even if
you're really up close to it you'll
eventually see it
and then there's more of an environment
ambient
where this one is you have to be above
it in order to see the object
so in order to know what those values
that we need are we need to have
reasonable signature generation across
the board
and the first pass of that is going to
be
um working with vet on what
emissions should we be seeing so that we
can get reasonable ranges for
uh ping for regular regular radar
passives
and nozzles for scanning once you're
there then we could take those values
and plug them into the
environment so that you could have more
stealthier areas like an asteroid field
could completely hide cs
and you're completely allowed with em
and ir
but we have to be careful what those
values are
because we want them at a range that
makes it harder to see
not completely blind players so
we will have some areas that emit
ambient because we're going to toy with
values to get it
there and once we have a baseline of how
we want this stuff to get we're just
going to keep pushing more
and more until eventually more systems
have it and then
ambience everywhere but 314 wise we will
have
ambient level within the pv yes
that is that is not like way far away
that's that has to come with this
because otherwise
the whole ambient signature sort of side
of it is kind of mood um
so there will be a ambient level plus uh
coming from the ships
chad is like jared asked a one question
it's my show i'm the boss i can do it
every once in a while
there's a lot of good information in
there uh
let's see will we be able to scan
planets to see what resources are on it
like life forms percent of oxygen
water weapons uh or weather
for instance and collect that kind of
data before we land on it
uh so can we start
with this can we star trek this mark yes
of course
i wish so one of the big fundamental
things that we've done
in our tech for the scanning
is trying to think of how we could get
anything scannable
and what and how we could unlock that
information so we built
out a system to allow us to
create ways of getting information
either through async calls or through
immediate data
like cargo takes a while to get so when
you're scanning it you may not get it
right away because we have to
go sent to a server which says it's
another server that eventually comes
back to you
so having a planet be able to be
scannable to tell you that information
is
achievable because we have that whole
system there and we could put it in to
unlock that information and send it to
the player
now whether or not we're going to add
that is a good question that's
where vehicle tech team builds out the
technology to allow
other teams to use those foundations to
add that information
so while it's possible i can't say yes
that's something that's going to go
there
but i know how kind of the behind the
scenes of the
planet works and the resources that are
there
is something we could obtain so
maybe in the future that is something we
could spot to the players
that hey maybe there's a severe weather
storm here or
there's cargo or there's something on
the there's a bunch of gold on this
planet somewhere go find it
and you could ping out that actually
would be kind of cool emerging
just have to start gameplay it in based
on what other content teams and feature
teams would like it to do
okay so we should totally tell the
mining team
hey we got there's this cool idea
with the engine uh somebody somebody
play star marine
uh with the introduction of fps radars
will we
also see the removal of god-eye bounty
markers for pvp bounties
it's gonna be a question for the pvp
bounty guys i guess
uh i would assume so because the whole
thing with with with bounty part of the
gameplay is
finding them right so it's not not super
fun if you
if you have this uh this infinitely long
and always on screen
you know go here um that's that's pretty
straightforward
uh you know and i wonder and i'm sure
you know they're gonna have a bunch of
layers like if
it's a certain bounty level maybe it
starts getting that bad like a gta 5
star kind of thing like like
okay everybody insert this guy he's
right here
uh let's let's avoid him but i don't
want to answer on the path
how close you are to the com relays and
the security stations where that
information is getting relayed or
whatnot but again and if you know you
have a bounty on you
again you're going to change the stealth
gameplay stuff right you're not going to
be loud you're not going to be going
into systems pinging and all that kind
of stuff so
i would i would i i would expect as much
um
but uh yeah we have to see as the fps
stuff comes on yep
well i guess you know this is
that boundary thing is kind of going
with um how other things goes you kind
of expose a system
with 100 here's everything and then you
start bringing back stuff with different
upgrade paths and bring it into other
systems so
at the time that was made radar and
scanning couldn't give them that
information or way to do any way of
uncovering stuff or going to find
where that bounty is so it's
now available so maybe that is something
that could get exposed so that you ping
out
and maybe you kind of go okay he's over
here
but again that's going to be more of the
feature team working on that particular
how they want to use radar scanning to
do that sort of information
uh we'll save that for the next time uh
uspu is on or something
there we go uh
as a follow-up to that uh what can you
tell us about
counter scanning tools aka jamming
so um radar
is based 100 on the signatures and the
ambient
and we do have and i was saying you know
environmental ambience
and um nearby of another object emitting
but there's also kind of a third one and
this is
when a chaff is emitted it actually
generates a
volume of ambience so you can't see in
between it in it or out of it
so if someone makes a big enough ambient
field that's how chaff
blocks out you like a missile lock or
how you're actually able to see that
object so um
bringing that emerging gameplay of how
we can make you know
maybe those little bits of ambient
fields around
um is something that actually was talked
about there's there's a concept of
a radar jammer which literally if you
activate just spits out
a bunch of ambient fields around you you
know we did something similar with the
um the interdiction
where you jam and it blocks things from
quantum traveling we could
literally do the same thing with radar
where you blind
stuff um around it it's things that are
feasible
but it's again one of those things do we
from you know is it something that a
ship
does is something that a player brings
onto the foot you know tech wise
we're there we will bring it design wise
ship just needs to say this is its
purpose
and then we'll start utilizing it and
then
the other thing is interference with
scanning
so we do have stuff in our design dock
that we're going to bring forth
through next patches as interfering with
scanning because if you're scanning
something
and your ship has precious cargo or even
stolen stuff
we want you to be able to kind of block
that so that there's counter of
interference so that if i
security scans you you're not going to
see the bad goods
but if he has a strong enough radar he's
going to be able to find it
so detection from radar and ping
there's a possibility of a jammer or the
system
has a way of doing it we just have to
incorporate that on the feature teams
or on ships and way of interfering with
scan
is stuff we're going to be introducing
uh through different patches
yeah so yeah mark pretty much touched on
all the active met
you know all the active sort of ecm
stuff that we have which is
you know chaff works like an acm thing
electronic countermeasure
uh right now um it just happens to have
the exact same signature that we do want
to mask and that's why
again you've got ir missiles you got em
missiles this is the whole reason for
those and the same thing will work with
radar
um but some of the passive stuff again
like the the the whole
uh player agency and and just being able
to set yourself up
uh on the ship side uh any mark talked
about the interference or
or or the lack or the the stronger your
signal is the less that interference is
going to affect you so basically if you
can remove stuff from your ship or turn
off things within the ship
that are that are louder that is your
you know effectively a passive counter
measure
you know effectively pat you're
countering
uh whoever else is scanner as best as
you can right now but the ecm's is going
to come from chaff
and then uh further to that you know i
would hope that from an operator sort of
scan position
um we could do more but uh in the
meantime it's all ambient interference
and uh current signature levels um then
the active one is chaff
like for example for the tank i want
smoke right then that should get
obviously it should just call out the cs
right why would you have a cross section
you can't see the tank
um so it's it's things like that why are
you shooting i'm just
i'm hiding ourselves exactly i'm just a
particle effect leave me alone
uh yeah and of course you know there are
always as a follow-up to that question
there are always the the ships that come
with
you know dedicated scan resistant
cargo compartments and stuff the mercury
star runner uh
i think the phoenix like shielded cargo
yeah exactly what
one of the constellations is supposed to
have a shielded area stuff like that
yeah and it doesn't make you immune to
the scan all it does is it really
increases the amount of interference so
it's going to take forever for the guy
to actually scan
the whole way yeah so it's either going
to take you longer or it's going to or
it's you know for the different levels
of scanners and stuff
it might protect you from like the first
three levels of scan but if somebody you
know upgrades to scanner 5
you know and and that's a good note
actually and it is part it was part of
the feature set and it was part of the
the the criteria that we set up the
feature on uh was that partial scans
give you partial info and actually
depending on the
interference there you're only going to
get a certain level of information
off the ship so you know for example if
there's a ton of interference you're
going to get the fact that it's a ship
maybe the name of the ship maybe even
the pilot but you're not going to get
anything else you have no idea about the
weapons you have no idea about anything
you're either going to have to get
closer focus if you can you know do a
whole bunch of stuff to
to make that happen in video games
nothing is absolute
there there there's there's a there's a
there's something you do and then
there's a counter
to that well yeah that's the idea and
just feeding back to the player that's
what's really important to us
is that you know people learn and play
with the system uh because they've got
feedback and they know what's happening
um you know and this this is the big
thing that's changed just based on the
old scanning
um like we used to have mfds with little
im and
uh uh em ir um uh
graphs but they weren't even you know
they were just flat numbers they said
they had no
there was no relative anything so you
knew it went up but like you don't know
how much that really went up and why
that matters um
so there was no way to learn uh what the
what the scanning was doing so now it's
a little more
it's a little more clear um and
immediately fed back to the player
i think one of the things i hope for is
you know it is false signature
generators being able to
you know be being able to you know fly
in something like
a gladius or something and and look like
i'm a idris
you know just just to freak people out
you want a thumper for out of
outer space yes yeah yeah i'm with you
yeah
um all right we are nearing the end
folks
uh let's let's let's do a biggie here
let's talk long-range scanning uh
this has been one of the you know
questions that we've had in the game for
a while now
it's with the advent of server meshing
you know
on the horizon and calling out things
here and there
you know somebody is on one server while
i'm on another server and stuff like
this
uh how are we
working to prepare ourselves for that
for to make sure
scanning doesn't have to be completely
redone again
when when that day comes sure um
one of the biggest things that we've
taken the liberty of doing is trying to
get rid of
the restriction of distance so before
the radar
would kind of have a flat distance of
how far it would see things and that's
it
and you know when you have your passive
radar uh you're basically a regular
regular radar that is only going to show
you the things that are technically
streamed in on your machine because
those are the stuff that are
active you could target that you could
shoot it you could interact with it
ping is mostly supposed to be the thing
that says
hey there's stuff out here that
maybe further out than your world view
they could be
in our immediate larry release a few
dozen kilometers away to
where we want to go once we get server
meshing in that where there's a few
hundred thousand kilometers away and
what we're doing with the technology is
um
when you ping out we've changed the
whole system to
do an async query so that once we have
the api
for server meshing ready we could query
the backend for fine things that are of
interest
to the radar that you have and then
report it to you
as a blob or even as a potential contact
depending on how far you are
and since we know what that information
was
because it was all information that was
just stored off in a data bank we could
uncover it
store some stuff in the blob so that
when you ping out
you see a blob far far away you could
scan it and go
there's something in here that's of my
interest
i could go fly that direction and then
proceed with more of the gameplay of
pinging and then eventually it comes on
your contacts
and you can see it that's where we're
heading towards
so the immediate is replacing our
existing systems and removing
restrictions so that you can see things
that are streamed
in and then once we have the server
meshing technology there we'll hooked up
those hooks so that we could uncover
the information that's been streamed out
and even across
um different servers because it's in the
local system
and then relay that to you into either
a point that's saying there's an active
contact here or a blob
and then you can scan it to uncover
whatever information
is relevant to yet scanner or that the
objects that are there
so that's where we're heading and that's
what the backend system for the radar
scanning is
going to is utilizing to move towards
uh giving players the ability to find
things further out
all right gentlemen well that's it it's
uh it's two o'clock here local it's the
end of your
your tour duty this week i gotta let you
guys because i know you've got meetings
and stuff to go to
uh mark sean as always thank you for
taking the time
uh out of your busy schedules to be here
with us uh
fps or fps and ship radar and scanning
everybody
it's been starts in live be sure you
check out isc uh came out yesterday for
some more information and an early look
at some of the work in progress
ui underway and uh come back to isc
next week for a look at capacitors
and operator modes and missile operator
modes and the missile rework and all
kinds of stuff that's uh
that's going to change the future of dog
fighting combat
so uh i'm jared that's sean
that's mark we'll see you later
everybody take care
see you later bye bye
you
