we actually have three terms in our
system we have
radar we have ping and we have scanning
radar is in a sense your passive
detection that is i'm flying around
things pop up on my radar and i can see
them then you have ping
where you have to physically hit a
button basically pulsates a ping
out into the world and i can see things
much further out
scanning is the layer where once you see
an object
you can scan it and retrieve information
on it
what i like about the current
implementation of radar is the dynamic
signatures
they fluctuate in and out depending upon
what you're doing
and because of that you could actually
go into your like ui
and see your ir and em fluctuate that
flexibility
is really cool because you could turn on
and off stuff and that changes your
signature and your strength
and how far someone can see you
something we don't like is the uh the
absence of any
information about how well you're
detectable
by either other players or ai at the
moment
for the current implementation of the
scanner it's really awesome to be able
to scan
ships right now and see if they have any
cargo especially with the lost system we
could determine if they have any illegal
cargo
it opens up immersion gameplay where i
could fly around scan some things and go
oh
that guy has some illegal things should
i be nefarious and
try to steal them or should i try to
shoot him and give him a warning
we want to improve the ping system so
that it gives you like a rough idea of
hey there might be some ships
maybe some bounties that you might want
to go after
and because we'll give you that info uh
at a further distance
it really allows you to make some uh
against player agency and
allows you to determine whether you want
to even investigate it or not
or you want to look in a different
direction so that's kind of how our
existing system
works um you know there's things that
were we really really like and of course
there's things that we want to improve
on and even flush out even further
and that's exactly where this new work
comes into play
with the new radar we've tweaked how
things get detected
so it's no longer two spheres colliding
it's just
to put it simply if your signature is
overlapping with somebody they're going
to see you
one thing we want to prove is to make
sure that we get proper query feedback
so
you know that if you're in a very high
ambient
signature area like a gas cloud it could
be hidden
and therefore make better use of the
spaces that we provide in the universe
sean tracy liked the idea of you know if
you have a bunch of capital ships
and a couple frigates that maybe you
can't see
some of those smaller ships what happens
if we had that moment where you could
have
some ships hide within the bigger ships
so when you're far away you're like okay
there's an idris maybe i could take it
out you get a little bit closer you
realize that there's a whole
fleet so it's going with that balance of
how do we hide things and how do we show
things so that we can get big amazing
moments and even stealth gameplay
so with scanning uh we want to increase
the granularity of the information you
get from scanning so
pilot the other players or ai that
are going to be on the ship um what type
of hormone it has when it's carrying its
cargo
going back to the other example with the
idris with a bunch of ships out there
you can scan it and go
i know that's a ship what ship is it i
scan from afar and go oh it's an idris
cool i don't see anybody else because i
have to get closer you get closer and
you start seeing other contacts pop up
you can take a deeper dive into what the
contents of that ship are so before
you're too far
back and you're like okay that's an
idris now you're close up and go oh
that's an idris with a
gigantic gatling gun that shoots auroras
doesn't exist but i like to pretend it
does
also we want to expose more interesting
information
we want to let you know that there's a
wanted person on board we want to let
you know
that maybe there's some volatile cargo
on board we want to let you know that
there's something interesting
relative to your specialization of the
ship it also
unlocks more stuff for the designers to
say
this type of scanner is going to be more
for medical use this type of scanner is
going to be more
for criminality or something like that
what we're doing with ping is uh for the
first time we're going to actually allow
you to
not only get the blob information which
gives you the rough
uh you know direction and size of the
entities that may be contained within
the blob so it gives you like
a rough area of where you might want to
investigate but
if the signatures are high enough then
you can actually scan the contents of
that blob
which is something we weren't able to do
before you won't see a lot of these
things
happen all the same time it opens up the
doors so that we could push things in
through patches and through waves what
we're looking for is a
fun player experience for finding things
ultimately players want to be able to
look out in the best into space and then
determine hey
this is something interesting that i
want to do and this is the direction i
need to go to
go experience that that fun thing um
that's what we're working toward as part
of our road to invictus
this brief primer on the future of radar
and scanning demonstrates an essential
component in creating a dynamic and
engaging sense of exploration
and danger for spacecraft in the
persistent universe in squadron 42 alike
and we're going to learn more about how
it all works tomorrow on star citizen
live when sean tracy and members of the
vehicle tech team
join us to answer your questions live
but up next
it's that time let's jump into another
sprint report
up first let's take a look at some
recent progress on hospitals
starting with these myriad hospital
props like
tables for the waiting area and medical
trolleys you can expect to see rolling
through the hallways
there was even a recent concept for this
high-tech gurney
and when i think about the the push-pull
possibilities here
it reminds me of the first time i was
kicked out of a hospital
and the second the team also progressed
on the gray box for new babbage's
emergency drop-off hangar
which needs to be cleaned up a little
bit
one of the various medical rooms the
exterior vistas outside the windows
and then dropping in some placeholder
signage as guides
for other artists when it comes time to
really dress this place up
in addition to the first pass signage
first pass greenery has begun
and the thinking is already that we need
much more verticality with the plants
so they'll be trying that next there's
also a look at the gray box nurses
station in the ward area
the team is currently thinking that this
will be the first area taken to final
art
so that it serves as visual guidance for
the remaining sections
of brentworth hospital ores in general
is also coming to the end of gray box
with this look at the lobby
assurance booths and other areas we're
gonna we're gonna let you discover for
yourself
when auras in general here enters final
art we expect to see much more of the
glass and special lighting effects you
saw
in our look at the commercial platform
arcade last quarter
heading now to outer space some of our
space gaping artists created some
early warm-up tests for the creation of
gas
clouds that will encompass the jump
point from stanton to pyro
beginning with the work already created
for citizencon 2949
it needed to be updated with all the new
technical advancements made since then
and better extrapolated out into
three-dimensional space
so that it can be approached from any
direction
we've not quite got back that beautiful
butterfly shape we had
but we'll be checking in again later as
it further progresses
those who have already jumped into alpha
313-1
currently available on the public test
universe know that
ship the station docking is coming along
with invictus launch week later this
month
and here you can see some of the final
lighting passes being done for the
various rest stop
and security station docking areas now i
haven't seen this yet
so i'm just gonna watch along with you
oh that's cool
oh yeah
following up on some of the armor
concepts we saw last week
here's a look at the high heat refinery
worker that's currently making its way
through the character pipeline
the text branding you're seeing here is
modular so it can represent
any company that's appropriate for the
location at hand
as is the helmet with multiple
variations to add variety to the npcs
milling about
and because it was important not to have
any exposed skin in an environment as
hot as this
there's also a neat way to access the
mobi glass so they can still check their
messages when needed
and last week subscribers got their
first look at new armor from tehachapi
a brand new small-scale manufacturer
that has burst onto the scene
and begun taking the markets by storm
now you can learn more about this new
manufacturer and their offerings in the
latest edition of jump point magazine
[Music]
finally let's take another look at the
habitation platform of orizon
the upcoming landing zone for the gas
giant crusader
we definitely want to preserve the full
reveal of everything that makes up this
amazing landing zone
for when you first visited in game i
think we can maybe share this brief
sprint on updating the cypress trees
that will find their way throughout the
[Music]
platform
and finally back to the hab rooms
themselves a much requested feature
many of the rooms come with windows to
the outside world
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that the next evolution of radar
and scanning
aims to put systemic tools in the hands
of our designers
to enable the exploration and discovery
of more than just spacecraft
and vehicles that hospitals are still
the harbinger of new medical gameplay
scheduled to come online in alpha 314
and that before all that happens
we're on the road to invictus with the
upcoming edition of ship to station
docking
and all the potential that brings here
there
might even be a capital-sized tour
coming
check out the schedule on the rsi
website if you haven't already
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
you
