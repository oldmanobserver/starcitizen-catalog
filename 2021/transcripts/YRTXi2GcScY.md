## Transcript

hi everybody welcome to star citizen
live a succulent chinese meal i'm your
host jared huckabee and that joke won't
make any sense if you're watching the
youtube replay
if you've never seen star citizen live
before so we take about an hour out of
the end of our week and hang out with
some of our developers talk a little bit
about the things they work on sometimes
we show a little bit of the things they
work on sometimes like last week we just
we just
train wreck for like an hour and hang
out with with with superstar concept
artists like gavin rothery on the show
this week we have an esteemed panel of
members from our uh fps
content and feature teams let's say
let's take a look at them now
here they are
we've got jj jj is this way we've got
zach
we've got jos
and we've got declan how you doing guys
hello good very well thank you how are
you jared
i'm getting by i'm getting by i still
got my i still got my comfy my super
swank uh a fashion hoodie uh which is
available which will be available in the
star citizen merchandise store uh i
think later today as part of the iae
festivities so um
sometimes i i shill stuff
thank you for making it
for me no i want one uh
today we're talking about fps content
and features uh before we get started
for some of you it is your first time
ever on the show so let's take a few
minutes introduce yourselves and tell
people exactly what you do and we're
going to start with jos jos who are you
and what do you do for star citizen
hi so i am juan holmir but everyone
around me here calls me uh joeys and i
am a senior fps technical designer
working on the
weapon feature team um some of the
features that i've been working on is
the attachment menu and the tractor beam
glad to be glad to be here on star
citizen live today i'm glad to have you
man
declan who are you and what do you do
for star citizen
hello um i'm a fps system designer three
and uh i've been working a lot with
armor lately uh movement systems doing a
little bit of that uh doors which are
not a fun topic won't talk about them
today they're horrible um but yeah
overall good
doors every
it is a it is a tried and true
maxim of game development and whenever
you bring up doors you just see the the
thousand yard stare
show up into any uh system designer you
said you said fbs system designer three
right
you're the first you're the first three
we've had on the show
to be fair i think it's kind of like a
new like i only changed to the three
recently even though like the roll is
still the same but uh yeah it's kind of
yeah
that's part of the two isn't it
well i mean
anybody else the two i don't wanna i
don't wanna i don't wanna i wanna crap
on somebody you know zach's gonna be
like number two
[Laughter]
i've had six or seven titles here so
uh at least no at least no roman
numerals at the end uh zack who are you
and what do you do for star citizen
i am an fps system designer three as
well and uh what i've been doing
recently i've i've been the juice guy
we've been making the weapons feel great
making the umph making the bangs just
making them as fun as possible to use
we're gonna mention some of that soon
what where's those cool sunglasses you
had before
oh oh they're on the floor somewhere
like most of them
you don't want to take them off and drop
them
i've lost honor here they are
there you go
zach's got a very complex filing system
where he just dropped everything on the
floor
this is a it's part of my floor this is
how we uh it's what we have to wear when
we're making the juice because it's such
an insanely hot topic
those seem like the kind of glasses that
a three would wear
and you know what you should see the
ones that the four wear you know those
giant like inflatable ones when you get
to four that's what you get but we're
limited i'm limited by my power at the
moment by being they're actually yeah
they're locked away in the office like
not allowed access to those so
yeah they're too powerful if you walk
around it
jj i haven't even beaten it three
like i said three and a half
that's not fair is it
jj no stranger to star citizen live uh
who are you and what do you do
um yeah i'm johnny savages i'm the lead
fps system designer and i work with all
these guys
on a bunch of different systems so
everything that these guys have
mentioned uh and more like we're working
on a bunch of systems going forward so
uh we're going to talk about a lot of
those today so i won't get into it
yes and we will get into it so that
lucky 13 can relax in the chat we'll get
to it lucky
this is my time
it's my time
all right so
as usual we collect questions from the
community uh on spectrum our bespoke
communication platform available on
robertsspaceindustries.com
where we let people submit their
questions and then vote up which ones
they want to see answered most and then
remove all the ones that are completely
and woefully uh uh
unapplicable to the team that we're
currently
have and then come up with more we can
also take questions in the chat you can
submit your question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets in the chat that'll help our
community team pull that out from the
chat uh we're gonna start with uh
probably the biggest question the
question that was on most people's minds
in the chat uh
hand salvage and this is an important
distinction there's salvage
and then there's ship salvage and then
there's hand salvage and since you are
the fps team we're going to talk about
hand savage hand salvage hand soundage
uh what will the first implementation of
hand salvage uh look like
sure uh i can take this one so uh
basically this is what we're calling
hull stripping which is the first tier
of implementation of salvage basically
so
yeah hand salvage but what is hole
stripping so hull stripping is
essentially you are using either the
multi-tool or dedicated tool to
get to a ship or a derelict or anything
in that
kind of like that vein
and you're basically using the tool to
strip away material that then you're
taking on board and storing in a
canister
for the very first implementation it
will be a very generic material that is
just kind of like launching everything
off the ship that you're taking off that
you're stripping away and it's
condensing it down and putting it in
there for either selling to obviously
make some money as a profession or you
can use it for repair as well which is
another part of the feature that we've
not really talked about too much and
it's essentially the reverse of what
salvages so if you think of salvages
like i'm going up to a ship pole i'm
firing my weapon and if you think about
something you're like have you ever seen
those really satisfying videos of those
like rust strippers the laser rust
strippers where it's just like that's
kind of like the look we're going for
but you're basically burning away and
taking on the uh the metals of like the
ship hole and you're kind of seeing the
skeleton underneath using the the damage
map system that we've got
and uh yeah you're pulling that away
into a generic material that you can
then use for repairing as well uh so
what will that look like so when you
strip away like say we'll be using the
damage map system and what we're
planning on doing is when you go to
repair you'll be basically patching the
holes caused by damage and restoring the
kind of metals in the area but obviously
because it's not a paint gun as well
it's not magic you'll basically be
storing it back to like almost like a
burnished metal structure so if you've
seen someone who's been through the wars
a bit and got out of their cockpit and
patched up their ship as a bit of an
emergency they'll be arriving back at
port with like big kind of like shiny
metal filling like holes in their ship
like they've had a you know like a bad
day at the dentist almost
um
yeah the the actually the basic
functionality that we're doing for fps
we're going to be using on the drake
vulture as well um because that's
obviously got the stripping guns to kind
of strip on a much larger scale compared
to fps
but obviously as jared said this is just
the very very first layer of salvage
the next iteration actually of han
salvage will be to start stripping
individual materials from ships so very
similar to kind of what we've done with
the the recent medical ui
is when you look at a ship you'll be
able to get some readouts of kind of
what the integrity of the hull is which
you can kind of either take away or
restore based on if you're salvaging or
repairing
and then
lost my train of thought now um
and then what was i up to oh yeah so
yeah so when you go and start trying to
grab individual materials from the ship
the ui will obviously tell you what
you're looking at what you'll be
gathering
and that will be like an additional
complexity to like if i repair my ship
with this substance i will get more of
its integrity back if i'm repairing the
wing with the correct thing basically
um so
that's kind of the next iteration of
hand salvage and then further down the
line obviously we're to build on that
for the ships which is kind of like the
cutting off parts and taking those on
and cutting away uh
using the like the muncher that we've
got on the reclaimer for example that
will be coming down the line as well so
i just want to stress that this is the
very first
kind of like dive into salvage that
we're going to have rather than it being
this is what it's going to end up being
for everything
and obviously we've got a couple of
tools that we're going to have so we've
got the multi-tool dedicated tool as
well for now the dedicated tool is going
to be limited to using this universal
material but it'll be able to strip
faster has a higher capacity and stuff
whereas down the line that will be using
the kind of
separated material functionality that
we've just talked about
and then i did steal another question
i'm sorry jared i stole another question
from
because i read through the spectrum
thread someone did mention can we remove
components and weapons from ships and
we'll be able to sell them
um i did want to cover that because
that's something that we're looking into
is a bit of a stretch goal for tier zero
where we want to do it we just want to
find the best way to do it so
if that is a case of like cutting around
or cutting the kind of attachment point
of a weapon or using the tractor beam to
almost pull it off we'll have to think
about options there and obviously uh
jois is mr ui so we'll be looking into
some options we've got there for like
how we message that across the best way
um as a follower from the chat uh there
there's a lot of the
a lot of the things that uh uh are done
in the first person like medical stuff
like this are beams
it's it's it's it's switch an attachment
switch an item shoot a beam at a thing
shoot a beam it heals the thing shoot a
beam it salvages a thing should a beam
it repairs a thing um
why is that let's talk a little bit
about why why why in a game of this size
and scope are are these things you know
beams and
like why aren't we making like operation
is this is
you're going to get what i'm saying get
where i'm going with this it's like
what why beams basically
well kind of for a start a lot of the
systems that we have in game at the
moment at the very very first
implementation of them so when you think
about it it was very convenient for us
to put that on something like the
multi-tool which is a very good base for
swapping in and out attachments changing
the functionality of it and kind of
getting the very first level of each of
these mechanics in there so when i talk
about salvage for example the multi-tool
the iteration that we're putting in now
which is the very simplest form of
salvage is always what the multi-tool is
going to do it's not going to do
anything more than that but everything
extrapolated out from that will be more
like for example being able to take
weapons off ships for example cutting
bits off and putting them in your
reclaimer going selling ship parts and
stuff like that that will all come down
the line so i think there's a obviously
if people are saying that everything
feels a bit beamy at the moment it's
because they have a
it's a lot simpler it's a much simpler
interaction than what it's going to be
down the line and there's going to be a
lot more considerations to kind of like
take into account and if you think about
even like the medical gun versus the
multi-tool it feels like if you have the
medical attachment for the mods tool
it's very
easy to run up to someone and go like
hey i'm going to heal you i'm
interacting with you i'm firing the beam
at you cool that's basically what it
what we wanted it to be it's a very
simple
uh way of keeping someone alive which is
what we wanted to be in the universe
it's like an emergency tool that you're
using to stabilize someone but when you
look at the medical gun you don't just
run up to them by the b or you can do if
you want to because the functionality is
on there but an advanced user or a
medical practitioner will be going over
to the advanced side
moving all the sliders around checking
all the symptoms all the issues that
they've got with them and making some
informed decisions based off that now in
terms of like my beams
obviously if we
wanted to make this a bit more visceral
and up close we're going to end up
taking a lot of control away from the
player so if it was say for example
jared you were down on the floor and you
were wiggling around on the floor and
you know i was trying to get hold of you
we'd both have to be locked into place
for that entire process which both might
make both of us like vulnerable for
example
taking control away from the player is
obviously sometimes appropriate but
doing it all the time for a lot of these
different mechanics makes things a lot
more difficult so obviously it's a bit
nicer to keep player control in keep
people at range and just kind of have
um
you know like almost beam or range
devices that let us do some of these uh
kind of perform some of these systems
the the control thing is where i was
hoping you were gonna go with that it's
it's in a
a multiplayer game losing control of
your character is
probably one of the least favorite
things that can happen but in a
massively multiplayer game where when
people can start prompts with you it's
like oh look i'm going to try to heal
you or i'm going to try and it just
stops you and it's it's you know in
order in order for the animations to
match up like you know this person's
gonna grab you and they're gonna you
know rip open your thing or whatever and
now your character is just stuck while
somebody else is essentially playing and
in control of your person is a very
uncomfortable and not very enjoyable
experience so so the beams allow that
kind of flexibility
and stuff like that and again as these
things develop and stuff like this there
will be more things like stripping the
components out manually and stuff and
going in and pulling this out and stuff
like that so so it's a good place to
start that protects everybody's protects
the victim's gameplay experience if it
were
uh
let's see uh
are there any plans to redo the player
interaction while holding f for instance
instead of having to search for floating
text perhaps you could actually
highlight the entire object you were
aiming at instead and then muscle and
when selecting text on anything with
more than three options it's a real pain
to use for instance uh this one
specifically when looting
yeah so this is something that we
obviously came across as we've been
playing the game because we all play too
right
we're doing a lot of testing with the
new inventory system and looting objects
off bodies and trying to take individual
armor pieces off or individual grenades
often obviously with the way our
physicalized kind of inventory works
with like the attachments it's quite
difficult sometimes trying to get hold
of the one that you want because the
floating text appears and that was
always something that was
not the permanent solution so we have
something
called the personal interaction system
and the personal interaction system
wheel that we want to implement down the
line which is essentially when you're
hovering over some of these items they
will highlight like they do now but
you're not going to automatically get
all the interactions appear on them what
we're going to do is we're going to
implement a essential default item
action for every item in the game based
off the state that it's currently in so
for example if something's on the floor
you can go over to highlight it click it
it will pick it up that's probably what
most people want to do with something's
on the floor they want to get it in
their hands and look at it
we'll be setting all of those
individually but that is also something
that is flexible for players to be able
to set their own default item actions
for different types of items so for
example if they wanted to
i don't know if this is possible but say
like
every time they see a grade on the floor
they want to throw it when they write
just click on it then they will
obviously automatically pick it up and
throw it like immediately or if they
want to change their default item action
of like if i see a magazine or sorry uh
like a minor ball
thing on the floor i can go up to it the
default might be to pick it up and then
you can store it from there or people
might just want to store it straight
away so it's just like okay i can change
that option i know i always want to do
this it's always going to go in my bag
so the flexibility is there for what
people want to do
and then yeah basically uh the other
option is you can right click on that
item so once you've highlighted over the
item that you want to interact with you
right click on it and we'll have a wheel
of interactions up like we do now which
should be a lot easier to use
all right
um
we already know that uh adding bullets
back into empty ballistic magazines we
don't know about adding bullets back
into empty ballistic magazines but this
person would like to know about energy
weapons uh can any more detail be given
on these such as if there will be a
significant cost to recharging magazines
possibly off a ship's power grid and if
there will be a distinction between
laser energy and plasma energy
uh yeah i could start this off at least
and just say that the there's definitely
upside and downside of each of the
ballistic weapons that we want to kind
of like touch on um so ballistic weapons
you've obviously got limited ammo
generally in a lot of cases are
ballistic magazines are
more limited in capacity compared to the
batteries or zac has been reviewing some
of that as part of the weapon audit as
well um but um basically in short like
ballistic weapons you get a bit less
ammo but you can go out in the field and
you can scavenge we've obviously got a
system coming in at some point i think
we've detailed before which is uh mag
stripping so you'll be able to take
ammunition for other magazines put it in
your magazine and you'll be able to use
that ammunition going forward eventually
when we get some of the suit systems the
powered suit systems the idea is that
you'd be able to potentially trickle
charge like your energy batteries so
they're a bit more versatile in that you
it might take a while to recharge but
over time like if you're on like a long
kind of like uh expedition or whatever
and you occasionally get into combat
then they should be trickle charging off
your suit and taking power away from
your suit to be able to kind of like
keep up on that so they're a bit better
for like a longer engagement kind of
situation um but then there are some
additional downsides to energy weapons
because that sounds like a big bonus
right i've got energy that keeps coming
back to my batteries which kind of comes
into like wear and overheat which is
something that decks actually been
looking at
yes so
if we touch about where for a second
when a weapon shoots it'll generate wear
and then that's for all weapons but for
energy weapons they can overheat if you
shoot too much um so for example you
know plasma weapons they might heat up
really quickly and then they would cool
down really quickly uh laser weapons
they might take a little longer to heat
up and then cool down slower um we're
always going to have the environment
that the players in you know impact the
cooling down if you're on a freezing
planet you would expect it to cool down
quicker
uh same with pressure like the
atmospheric pressure would impact it a
little bit
um with some weapons you know like the
ascav
it takes a while to shoot the next shot
so it could cool down immediately not
immediately but in the duration between
the two shots so
even though it would generate heat it
might never overheat
um
but the thing is of overeating like
because it's generated by player actions
you will be able to control it you don't
you're not forced to overheat you know
if you if it's getting hot just stop
shooting
and uh it'll cool down before you
do any wear to the weapon itself
what is the larger picture of the wear
and dirt system look like you know we
haven't talked about this in a while uh
is it just a cosmetic or how will it
impact uh players and their weapons
okay so wear and dirt there are actually
two separate systems but they work very
closely together so um
where as we mentioned you know with
weapons you gain wear when you shoot and
when you game where the weapon
durability goes down
um
durability is separate from hp though so
a weapon would have a hp value and a
durability value
as the durability goes down it could
start to you know
get misfires that kind of thing would
occur um the lower low durability the
more likely they are and more severe
they would be
um with dirt
the dirtier your weapon is the more
weight the more where it would gain
um
same with armor you know armor it would
lose wear through just running sprinting
you know
aggressive movement so to speak but then
if your almost dirty then
it will gain wearer quicker
um
with regards to dirt i'm just trying to
think dirt oh there's also
when your item receives damage
a percentage of the damage will also be
applied as where um so you can't have
like a 100 durability weapon that has 10
hp like doesn't really make sense so
kind of trickle down um
but yeah with dirt like the biome and
the weather you that you're in will
impact the amount you gain over time
um if you're in a space station it's
it's a clean environment you wouldn't
expect to
generate too much dirt at all
if you dropped your weapon on the ground
it would
you know that would be a little bit of
dirt if you're going prone that movement
you know more dirt that kind of thing
and uh of course a lot of ways which
players can they can clean their weapon
they can clean themselves they can
restore uh whatever durability has been
lost so
thank you yeah it is it's core it's kind
of a system that will add to the
tapestry of the pu where it's just like
everything you find isn't always going
to be pristine anymore it'll be like i
open a loot box and i find this weapon
this weapon almost has its own history
to it you found it as one someone else
might have used it like another player
might have left it there like it's just
going to basically add to the
basically the the visual diversity as
well as like the kind of essence of the
pu where
not everything is permanent not
everything is pristine things have aged
things can break um obviously if you
look after your stuff then that's really
good but you can go and get it repaired
refurbished that's the idea at least
but if you don't look after it it will
eventually break
all right so is that going to lead to
things like diminished fire rate and
or inaccurate firing misfires that kind
of stuff
yeah so misfires would definitely be a
thing um if we use weapons as an example
again it's the easiest one um we've
currently you know we're doing like
three categories of misfires minor major
and critical
minor one would be a dry fire a major
one would be you know it jammed and you
need to clear it and then the critical
one would be the weapon pretty much
blows up in your hands it falls apart
and that one you would expect to occur
when the hp has become low as well
because when you do encounter a misfire
it does take away the uh weapons hp as
well um you know
lots of accuracy that could be a thing
you know still early earlier earlier
design so we're still millionaire ideas
um
but of course you know you it so long as
you keep your weapon in good condition
you won't encounter misfires they only
begin to occur once the durability has
dropped to a certain threshold so
if you're prepared and you keep yourself
in good condition then you want to worry
about them
and for the folks in the chat that are
um
maybe reacting a bit negatively to the
idea especially in a game that has
permadeath uh let's remember that you
know these these this isn't a thing
where you you drop prone once and your
thing drops
it's like this this it's it's like we
said after the future of space combat
thing you take it to the point of
realism yes you convert it to the point
of believability then you bring it back
to the point of fun
so it's so it's it's a thing that will
be constantly balanced and constantly
adjusted and even the the very first
version of this that goes out won't look
like the next the second version won't
look like the third version because
these things are all going to be
adjusted and tweaked and twerked and and
what not based on feedback from
everybody you guys are internal testing
all of it so
so uh so yeah
so
give that a chance uh let's see look for
the chat here uh
any chance we can get a fireman carry
instead of just body dragging
this person really wants to chuck people
over the shoulders i guess
uh yeah so we have talked about this
actually because obviously we do have
the body drag for moving people around
um but that's kind of more what we
envisioned that as is that was more of a
short range and quick action of say like
you know you're in a firefight one of
your buddies has gone down and you want
to get them to cover you can kind of
very quickly run out grab them pull them
away well be able to kind of like fire
off with your pistol a little bit uh but
the firemen carry is probably going to
be something that's going to be better
for
long range so like if you know my ship's
a kilometer away and i've gone out with
you jared and we're having a good time
and then you accidentally fall off a
cliff or something and i don't have the
healing equipment with me and it's back
on the ship i'm not going to want to
drag you across a rocky surface like
all the way back to the ship
um like that might actually finish you
off um
i want a bit more of a robust carry for
kind of like longer distances and we've
kind of talked about this for stealth as
well um obviously stealth is a big part
of the
combat
loop that we've got especially against
ai
again body drag's really good for just
dragging your body around you know
behind a dumpster or whatever and hiding
it but if we eventually want to do
things like hiding a body in things
we're gonna need some way to get them up
on us and put them in so or put them
over a railing or something like that so
we've talked about this as an option
it's something that we definitely want
to do in the future
people are freaking out about twerking
now
i'll talk to steve bender and he'll do
it if i ask so so you all better behave
in chat you just do it i'll just do it
i'll do it for the game
both
um joey let's talk a bit about hacking
uh we've seen hacking on the road map a
couple times it's it's pushed for a
couple of various reasons we're not
going to get into that but
about hacking is the features about how
it's going to work describe to us uh
where we're going what our intentions
are with hacking um what kind of
what what kind of things we're looking
to be able to hack to take control over
you know it better than i do so
talk to us about hacking
yes so hacking hacking is a very
exciting feature
this in my opinion so currently how the
hacking that's implemented in the pu
work right now is you basically go and
you buy a chip and then somewhere in the
universe you find like this chip slot
of like a hackable computer that you
insert the chip into and it's basically
a timer that ticks down and it's got a
chance to jam so you need to restart it
and um
what we wanted to do with hacking moving
on from that the current implementation
is that we wanted to imp introduce some
more um
engaging gameplay when it comes to
hacking
um
so we've explored a bunch of different
concepts and we've had a
long period of experimentation and
you know playing around with different
ideas in internally in the design team
um so
what we have right now for what hacking
is gonna be
um
going to add this hacking device which
is going to be something that you can
equip in your hand and
then we're going to still
keep those chips which basically works
like like the ammo for the hacking
device so you have the hacking device in
your hand
and
there's going to be these things in the
world that you can hack
you go up to them interact with them and
they
connect wirelessly
and
you're going to see this 3d
visualization of
a network
and you're going to be able to move
around at this network
and also
manipulate the network to open up new
paths and new routes and
um
and while you're inside here like what
is your objective like
how do you how do you complete the hack
well basically you find this
um
weak points that you insert um like a
trojan horse into and then
you connect those up
um
together
sounds pretty simple um
but there's also going to be these
antivirus systems present
when you're hacking so someone might
have like
um
yeah an antivirus that's gonna try to
stop you basically and put
like make your your life of hacking uh
harder
um
and that
leads us into like difficulty scaling so
there's gonna be
like varying ranges from like the easier
hacks they might be smaller and very
quick to to complete and very
straightforward and then
on systems that have more antivirus um
like a higher antivirus
level presence is going to be
quite a
quite a hard challenge for the players
to
um
to finish the hacks
um
we also have
a way to play this hacking game
through a
command prompt so you're basically going
to be able to
um
in addition to the the normal control
scheme you're gonna be able to
type commands which control the hacking
and
uh there's gonna be various
um
bonuses that you get from from using the
command prompt over the default control
scheme
um
so hopefully that's gonna scratch that
hardcore hacking fantasy
urge that a lot of players uh i think
are expecting from from this um
so okay so why would i hack stuff like
what can i hack well you're basically
you're hacking in order to gain access
to a system or
part of a system that you previously
didn't have access to
so what could that be like the most
straightforward
um
example is a door you know there's a
door it's locked you don't have security
access
you hack it bam now
it's open and it opens up a new path or
maybe
a room that contains valuable loot or
um whatever the level designers come up
with
um
mainly it's gonna be like
or secondly it could be like computers
or terminals which control other systems
like
um
like gravity could be a cool thing that
it controls um
or yeah whatever the level designers can
come up with
it's basically you make the system and
then it's whatever the they apply it to
yeah whatever whatever the scenario um
that they're designing for uh loot
containers as well and could require you
to hack them
um
eventually
later later down the line you're gonna
be able to hack someone's ship
and that leads
us onto
the pvp aspect of hacking
which um
basically if someone's hacking your chip
you're gonna get a notification that
there's someone someone's trying to gain
access to your system and you can
actually
go in and take manual control over the
uh antivirus system and try to
hopefully you'll do a better job than
the antivirus
ai would
okay
did you even consider just firing a beam
at it
can you consider it no this is a
wireless yeah this one is wireless yeah
we've got the devices wireless yeah
but uh yeah what we've really wanted to
try and lean into is uh selling the
hacking fantasy because that was when we
first started off with this it was that
was the part that we really struggled
with it was like we were coming with
ideas for the
almost like this uh system to kind of
demonstrate hacking but it didn't feel
like you were hacking so now we've
almost created this asymmetrical game
mode where it's like you are hiding in
this maze of a network you're relaying
the path and you're trying to find your
way around it and you don't know you
aren't aware of where everything is
you're trying to discover it and find
all of these routes and you're trying to
create these networks and obviously at
the same time on the other side
the antivirus doesn't know where you are
and they're constantly searching for you
so it's a very
uh like joe said it's a very like a kind
of like the bottom end it's a very quick
little puzzle that you can kind of get
through like if i was trying to get on
your ship jared and you lock the door
that might be you know you bought a
cheap ship for example uh you know i can
get in really easy with this little
puzzle you might get a warning that i'm
on the ship but then if you say like you
know you're on an idris and i was trying
to hack into your systems and start
interrupting your shields and stuff that
would be like the
you know we're in a big network here i'm
really having to you know sweat and work
to to figure out how to
basically break in and you're very you
know you're getting alerted that someone
might be trying to get into your system
and then you're like oh my god i need to
try and get in here and take manual
control to get this guy out so
we really wanted to kind of sell a
hacking fantasy in
a
visual format that people will quite
easily understand but also we wanted to
cater for people who want to use
something like the command prompt for
the true like hacking feel and there is
definitely scope there to kind of
utilize both and take advantage of
either side so i fully imagine like a
power player of hacking would be like
almost making like macros for the
command prompt and hitting those and
gaining the benefits from that while
he's like selecting things on the map at
the same time using the visual interface
so
uh i'm very very well we're all very
very excited to get it out there and
we've been playtesting it internally and
we're all really really liking it
definitely it's it's basically like a
combination of a puzzle game and a
stealth game
um
yeah
it's shaping up pretty pretty cool i'm
excited about it
all right
um
we gotta take this one from the chat
here uh
can we please
get a select all so that we can drag all
the loot all at one time from one
storage to another so we don't have to
continuously drag one item like a at a
time
like like a like a
i'm not going to say that word
uh so what do you what do you think
select all uh
yeah we we've talked about doing a move
all basically uh we know how many items
people are managing in some of these uh
in some of the inventories they've got
in locations or the bigger ships so
uh it's just part of more ongoing
improvements right because this is the
very first iteration of inventory that
just went out it was a pretty big
undertaking for us that there are just
more improvements to come down the line
like we want to add a search feature in
future so like obviously you've got your
filters at the moment this would
basically be a search filter like you'd
expect from kind of any search filtering
system uh but basically like you know
i've got i know i've got a p6lr in here
somewhere so i'm going to type p6lr
it'll filter everything else out and
it's there so you can very quickly find
what you want you can even potentially
type like pistol and it'll search for
any pistols you can do that so it's just
another quick iterate like way that you
can kind of filter through your
inventory stuff like visual improvement
so improve the lighting on the character
highlighting them with the cameras like
behind a wall or kind of like behind a
counter or something like that that's
something else we want to do
even things like showing tooltips uh on
the tooltips themselves showing what's
attached to it so it's like if i have a
weapon with a you know a presser and a
scope and another barrel attachment on
there it'd be nice if that was listed on
the tool tip so you can actually tell
what's on there
but yeah basically there's a lot more to
come for the inventory uh that was the
first iteration and we just want to make
it better and better and better
jos uh as far as the antiviruses are
there gonna be like a good better and
best and if there if there are tears
will there be a horrible norton
that just prevents you from doing
anything on your own ship
like you're
[Laughter]
i'm not sure about the northern one but
there's there's definitely going to be
different tiers of antivirus
um that you're going to come up against
toast i lost as a sponsor
still too early
uh you have multiple new ammo types on
the roadmap uh could you elaborate on
what they will be at this time
yes so we have a couple of cool ones uh
we've got uh plasma and um fire
incendiary even it's uh basically they
were more like a damage over time so you
could uh you could inflict some sort of
damage and then maybe there's an
additional dot and eventually you know
we kind of want to work then to a more
uh you know we complain some of our
systems like hey if you've got fire it
could interact with this if you've got
plasma it can interact like this so for
example if you had a say if you had an
lmg which had incinerate rounds you
could um provide suppressing fire on an
area if you shot at the ground in this
scenario the the ground could then end
up
you know catching fire so if you want to
flat you know push someone out of cover
do you want to shoot plasma at the
ground near them that could end up you
know causing these hazard zones
essentially so you've got this really
cool fun way of forcing players out of
their uh their situation you know we've
got so many cool ideas that we're
brewing up these kind of things that
were we're really excited to get these
damage types in and make them meaningful
so you know the difference between
having incineration ballistic and so on
and so forth is actually relevant we're
also working on something called uh
disarray which is uh which ties into a
lot more systems that come out later so
you know interacting with the
uh you know players armor and their
power system and stuff like that
obviously that's a bit further away
yeah it's worth noting that that will
work on the ships right now because
obviously we've got the electromagnetic
weapons that they use you can take the
ships down without causing damage to him
disarray is a very similar version of
that but it's kind of like trickling
that damage in overtime
what about other sidearms like machine
pistols or personal defense weapons
sawed off shotguns you know uh uh they
got all kinds of ideas here uh what can
you tell us about more diverse sidearms
so this is something obviously we care a
lot about you know when we say we want
to add a weapon or a sidearm muslim we
want it to be very impactful and
meaningful so you know i've been doing
more kind of a bit of a weapon audit
which is you know analyzing what we have
and you know how useful things are so
for example the uh
the lh86 the uh gemini pistol we're
saying okay this this could probably be
a machine pistol like th this is an
interesting fun difference that this
pistol can actually be so it's a lot
more meaningful and impactful than like
compared to like the uh the bearing
pistol and so on and so forth
we're gonna do we're gonna obviously
make that when we make these changes
we're very considerate of how the weapon
looks and how it feels so that will come
with like a whole new recoil for it and
uh some art changes like extending the
magazine
uh some other examples of how we're
making like sidearms more interesting is
the art like pistol that's going to be
potentially turned into a three round
burst rifle uh not rifle sorry three on
burst pistol you know just to kind of
get that variety up and you know people
like burst pistols and stuff they've got
something to
uh play with
and uh you know kind of um
uh going further than that we talk about
this weapon audit where we're looking at
all our fps weapons and how they can be
improved so for example sniper rifles
when you're aiming down the sights um
and you fire when you pull the bolt um
it can jitter a bit and not look as
great as we want it to be so we're
really looking at this kind of stuff to
make them feel better
um but i mean as far as the weapon order
it goes it's pretty it's pretty
all-encompassing at the moment you know
we've been doing competitive analysis of
different tiles slowing their stuff
frame by frame down looking at real life
you know to understand where that you
know that weapon juice comes from
because we have this great roster of
weapons but we want them to feel
like they're in a game that's launching
in like five years
you know that we want them to be stand
out and feel fantastic so we're really
looking how we can make these things
feel as juicy as possible uh but you
know completely looking at our tools and
changing them up if you were to see what
the p4 looks like now in our current
weapon branch it would blow your mind it
looks like a thousand times better
it's insane it's it's it's something we
really care about you know make them
feel as good as possible because it kind
of ties into that more like you know
looking at the weapons in general we've
been we've been looking at some weapons
and you know their their functionality
is maybe a bit samey compared to like
other assault rifles so for example yeah
the the gallant rifle that's you know
it's it's a chloe weapon
which is you know it's our all-around
weapon so it's like well this could be a
burst weapon right it's purely a burst
weapon but then we say it has a three
round burst and a five round burst five
round burst obviously you know a bit
heavier recoil bit longer downtime
compared to three round bursts but it
gives you that like active choice as a
player to do something interesting then
we look at like the uh the lumen five
that's a that's uh that's a five round
burst smg i believe currently um er but
we're looking at you know
we want to make that like far more
interesting and give it a bit of
uniqueness so we say yes this is a burst
smg but you can tap down the trigger
because the the actual um downtime of
the
the burst is a lot lower so it's like
you can you can basically get it going
full auto but it is essentially a burst
lng uh srs engine and then we another
good example there 71 right that's
supposed to be a maximum rifle and the
recoil is a bit weird it can kind of
move up and down a little bit but you
know we want to get it in more in line
with like what it feels like to shoot a
marksman rifle where we have like a
consistent offset pattern that you can
go like
shoot shoot shoot shoot with you know if
if you tap the trigger as much as
possible you should kind of be punished
for that
and then last i'd say last one i'm gonna
say of the arrowhead uh it shakes when
you aim which isn't great which isn't
kind of what we want and we're looking
at that and like you know how can we
make a chloe sniper rifle more
interesting basically
um yeah so it's it's it's been really
good we've made a lot of really good
progress making the weapons feel amazing
big thing as well leaning into
manufacturer identity right you've got
if you've got a bearing rifle you expect
that to be sensible you've got a cast
like arms rifle you kind of want that to
be crazy you know you almost refer to it
to being a bit more what you'd expect
from like a soviet weapon right like in
a thousand years time like what what
would what would uh a crazy cast that
kind of black market weapon behave like
versus something like a bearing which is
a lot more military a lot more sensible
yeah there's there's lots of stuff going
on right right here um would you must
say something with jj
yeah i was just gonna say a lot of it's
about weapon personality like you've
covered the manufacturer's stuff and
it's just like you know we don't want
all of our weapons to feel the same we
want them all to feel different and
obviously like joes you were working
with me on this a while ago now is like
one of the things that we did do was we
put live weapons in a spreadsheet and
just said like
how do we want to make it feel different
how do we want to set it apart from
other weapons
uh obviously down the line we might make
more weapons that feel the same but
right now we want to kind of like give a
kind of
breadth and like selection of gameplay
options for everyone to kind of use and
we want to see how those are applied in
the pu so
um we were looking at like real world
analogies of weapons weapons from other
games and just kind of saying like you
know where does this fit in like what's
our first stage of like where we want to
aim this thing out and then obviously we
do the star citizen pass and make sure
that it's suitable for our game and it
feels right um so yeah it's been a very
long process and it'll probably keep
going for a long time um but we've kind
of the first stage has used the tools
that we've got zach's been doing a lot
of improvements to the things like the
recall which hopefully we should be
seeing in the relatively near future
uh and i'm gonna address some things
from the chat here for a second uh guys
he said five years as an offhand
remark just pull the time frame of
things out development of this game will
go on and on even past the point where
it's beta past the point where it's 1.0
it's
kind of the game just keeps going even
past whenever releases
uh second for those one asking about
time frames time frames when is this
when is that that's what the public road
maps for be sure you check that out on
robertsspaceindustries.com
roadmap that's our best and most
up-to-date information about when
things are getting added into the
persistent universe you'll find no more
accurate information than what's right
there
and
and
finally uh the views and opinions
expressed by jared huckabee about the
norton antivirus do not reflect those of
roberts space industries clan imperium
games or their subset areas and i
apologize to all users of norton who are
watching the show
here's right there because you have to
use norton
all right uh let's move on to the next
thing here climbing and mantling right
now seems kind of lackluster uh there's
only certain things you can actually
interact with to do these actions uh
will it feel more intuitive in the
future
or
instead of as it does right now which is
just kind of
click and go
um so yeah
we're working on a few different things
so uh one thing is that a ledge grab
will be coming at some point which is
like
at the moment you can't jump over a gap
and grab onto a ledge that's just simply
not possible the system doesn't allow
for it right now
um i think uh the way it actually
technically works is you need the the
top of the ledge to almost be aligned
with the floor it always needs to find a
floor there so that just won't work and
that's something we want to work on next
um there are some definitely some
general improvements like i think you've
mentioned in the question which was like
if you welcome something waist height
you should be able to climb it this ties
into a couple of things so like there
are some bugs associated with this which
actually we found there are some issues
when we were going through the
citizencon flow that there were problems
that were raised that we've noted down
that we're going to work on as soon as
we get chance and then
another intention is that obviously
everything at the moment is manually
marked up
for climbing and it's obviously with the
world as big as we have it's uh it can
be easy to miss some of those things
we've got so many locations we've got a
lot of procedurally generated content
and stuff on the planet too uh sometimes
we will miss stuff so the eventual
intention is that we might be able to do
some sort of auto markup but that is
probably when we're talking time frames
that is further down the line than
everything else
but that is where we want to get to
eventually
all right uh can we either draw weapons
inside safe zones to modify them without
shooting or get a space inside safe
zones where we can uh pull these things
out like weapon stores or gun ranges or
something like that
so i
think you can do that in the pe right
now now that we've added the new
inventory system i'm pretty sure if you
grab if you have weapons on your back
and you grab an attachment from your
inventory and you start pulling it over
you'll see the attachment points on the
weapon i'm not 100 sure if you can do a
swap or take them off from the weapon at
the moment so that is something i can
look into and see if we can get that
working but otherwise there's kind of no
good way to get in kind of like this
other part of the question is that
there's no good way to get a weapon out
in the green zones right now because
there's no we don't have a robust enough
system to kind of like have you know law
enforcement come and you know deal with
you basically so that's something that
obviously the pu team's looking at long
term we've had a lot of discussions
around how we want to handle it and it's
just something that we're going to roll
out down the line
and then you will be able to get a gun
out and then get arrested
uh let's talk a bit about melee weapons
uh or uh let's talk about non-lethal
weapons first then we'll do melee
weapons uh lots of questions in the chat
about non-lethal things like tasers or
batons stuff like that uh what can you
tell us about your thoughts about
non-lethal weapons
so
we know we 100 need them for professions
like bounty hunting and even people who
you know want to
or if they get into a a situation where
they are almost like under attack and
they want to kind of almost have a more
passive solution they have an option
there so that is one of the reasons why
we made the taser or the stunt gun
and we have concepted it we know exactly
what it's going to look like we've kind
of gone through a bunch of that stuff
it's just a case of getting it through
the content pipeline now
i don't believe there's too much
engineering work involved either this is
a designer saying that by the way
but we do have
the lightning bolt weapons for example
that we put out a little while ago
um they are using the same sort of
damage that the stun gun is going to use
but it's we've pulled the lever slightly
to actually do lethal damage rather than
stun damage so we have the system in
place to be able to do what we need to
do there
and then let's go into the melee
question
um baseball bats batons baseball bats
the
the sledgehammers
baseball bats
what are our outlets here
sure answer we we do play all of
cyberpunk with a baseball bat
i don't necessarily think we'll we'll
have a baseball bat but we might have
something similar like swords you know
more improvised weapons like crowbars
like
you might find like a junky looking axe
that someone's kind of assembled and
taped together kind of thing and yeah we
definitely want to do things like that
something that might be stored on your
back one of your weapon slots in your
back there's a lot kind of got a much
wider and like uh longer range of attack
we could even potentially i mean the
melee system is already there right
we've got the the system with the knife
and we've tested it with a few other
things so it does potentially work and
obviously it's a lot of animation work
and
tweaking work to get it actually feeling
good but you can do it with a two-handed
but you can do it with a one-handed
weapon so uh
yeah and definitely something in the
future that we want to look into and we
have
talked about already
people hearing stuff about katanas
there's one for the weebs
rich tyra big fan of katanas
so you all know
that statement rich i love you
and i i will add there was a baseball
bat behind the counter in the pyro demo
at citizencon so yeah i'm not saying
that i'm just going to say you're going
to have to deal with me in the uk uh for
a lot of next year so
so uh i'm just going to i'm just trying
to needle you eventually you'll get to
need to keep you on my good side
eventually you'll give them uh let's
switch gears to armor uh this is a
question that comes up quite regularly
we see this uh
at least once a year on these shows uh
will heavy armor eventually prevent
players from being able to operate
certain vehicles or turrets or
other places where
players are supposed to get into and
operate
so funnily enough this was actually
something we talked a little bit about
today so that's good timing um
essentially uh anything with complex
controls say like flying a ship um we
want to prevent you from doing in heavy
and potential and even medium armor
because if you actually wear those
things and look at them like the glove
thickness and everything and how bulky
the chest piece is
it would make it very very difficult to
try and fly in something like that so
totally be able to do it light armor on
but the expectation is you should be
able to remove that and store it uh
before you get into a cockpit or you get
into a seat on one of the larger ships
and there should be options on at least
the very large majority of those ships
to be able to store armor somewhere
convenient that if you are in a
situation where it's like hey i looted
this heavy armor and i want to get back
in my ship i've got somewhere to put it
as long as you've not stored you know
like 50 000 red pens in there like i
know some of you like to do um but uh
yeah that's basically the idea and there
are obviously benefits between light
medium and heavy
like light you're obviously moving
around a lot faster but you're a lot
more vulnerable in things like combat
whereas heavy is a lot more combat
focused and there are downsides like not
being able to fly a ship um so you're
factoring in things like weight stealth
speed protection and so on and even
ability related things like being able
to fly
back it's as a follow-up here back at
citizencon uh
2019 uh we we first talked about
archetypes and the different armor
archetypes uh uh
dec you want to give us an update about
the archetypes how that's going where
we're at with that oh so we're
progressing um we're kind of you know
really filling out what kind of stats
they should have um so there'll be four
archetypes is what we have planned would
be combat specialist uh utilitarian and
support
combat is you know your soldier it's uh
it's good at combat um it would be poor
exploration that kind of thing
specialist that's more of you like your
bounty hunter assassination role it's
going to be stealthy it's still going to
be doing a good damage of mitigation but
not as much as combat
utilitarian that's your exploration suit
you know it'll be good temperature
ranges good pressure that kind of thing
good inventory size as well for you to
start throwing stuff on your back or in
pockets whatever
and then support it's really good at
power generation which you know is more
for when
armors have power that kind of thing but
you know it would be like players could
give you magazines that you could charge
up that kind of thing um i think it's
got like double the med pen consumable
slots and everyone else
so it's just like a walking healer just
drugging people up don't even ask for it
just hit them go on that kind of thing
but yeah it's it's going along um still
way to go but we're making progress
yeah it's something we don't want to
roll out just yet purely because
there are gameplay implications and
upsides and downsides of each that we
don't have yet so like as deck mentioned
a big upside of support is the power
generation stuff which is basically not
going to be you know it's a quite a big
undertaking to get that working on the
uh on the armor and that's not to say we
have to wait for that to go in we just
need enough upside and downside on each
and get that going before we can
actually roll this change out so people
are gonna start seeing some differences
between all the different
armors uh we've only got five minutes
left so let's let's do some lightning
round let's see let's see how many more
of these questions we can get in before
we got to let you go um
let's see uh with a combined weight of
armor weapons backpacks and other
equipped gear on services affects
stamina dehydration etc
okay so we're doing speed answers so
kind of lit links into what we just said
some of it's already in stamina
difference is there already so if you're
wearing heavier armor your stamina is
going to drain quicker as you're running
around or sprinting so like light
loadouts can sprint double the distance
let's say like a heavy cam for example
uh and that kind of indirectly affects
longer and hearse
hunger and thirst as you're moving
around because you're going to be
running for longer because you're going
slower
but obviously this is something we keep
evaluating as we go as more and more
things are added to the actual status
system we need to take things like this
in mind
well loot boxes drop rare items weapons
armors decline
yes kind of they'll drop higher quality
items and some of those high quality
absence will be wearable you could also
purchase a high quality item from a shop
and by virtually being on sale it
wouldn't be as rare as like a tier 5
helmet versus a tier 5 pistol for
example
right uh will we have ways to subdue
players via certain gadgets like zip
ties or handcuffs joeys
right so that would i guess
tie into the bounty hunting gameplay uh
so restraints we are we are talking
about like adding stuff like handcuffs
that would uh limit your your movement
and what you can
interact with
um
while still being awake
uh
and sedatives now that we have the new
actor status
systems with the drugs uh that's
definitely something that we're looking
into like what type of sedatives could
we add they put someone to sleep so
they're just you don't need to cut
handcuffs
will there be different equipment like
backpacks but not for storage such as
jump packs or thruster-based parachutes
portable radars scanners or computers
cloaked or shield devices power packs
for recharging energy weapons
let's say declan
uh yes we're having like professional
suits which have like specialized
backpacks and you know they'll link up
with the suit link or with
uh whatever you know specialized
equipment you're holding um it's early
days yet so like we don't have jump
packs planned right now but it you know
ideas are still flowing through and we
also have modular backpacks so you could
take parts out of a backpack throw the
parts in which would include like power
packs and oxygen tanks whatever that
kind of thing
maybe
parachutes
maybe
i mean that would be his own backpack if
we do that that won't be on a module but
yeah
well you need two so it'd be two modules
anyways
i'm trying chat uh any thoughts on
introducing smoke grenades for
concealment and marker purposes
smoke grenades yes we're doing smoke
grenades for for concealment
i
quite like the idea of them being
colored as well we'll definitely look
into that
um we're doing a whole bunch of
different grenades that we have planned
right now uh like
emp grenades and noise grenades and stun
grenades and
even cinderella grenades so
something we're working on yeah okay
uh
jj let's talk to me about alien fps
weapons we see these cool banner weapons
and xi'an weapons and stuff but what
about the fps weapons give me my give me
my alien weapons yes we we will do them
at some point obviously we wanted to
fill out the more standard weapons first
we're going to start getting a bit
weirder with the human manufacturers
next like if you look at the vault
weapons they have all the evolving fire
modes and stuff
which i can't really dig into running
out of time but the kind of summary is
yes we want to do them at some point
we're just finishing out the more
typical ones first
okay
uh
any intention to add more fps gadgets
things like deployable shields or
sentries
yes
a lot more gadgets are going to be added
um
like we have
currently we're working on something
like um like different types of mines
like proximity mine and laser trip mine
uh so you could basically you know
mine up your ship so no one comes and
steals it or
um
deployable shields yes we're also
working on that and there's something
like something that you would place down
and it would create a barrier um
also something that resembles a riot
shield
so like imagine pushing up an objective
or storming a base with like the bright
shield dude at the front and then
everyone hunkering down behind them
um
and uh yeah deployable turrets are also
in the works
can we please get some resistance to
knock down while crouched i'm already
knocked down jj
yeah
night vision goggles have been mentioned
a lot on spectrum we talked about it
with the ui team about two weeks ago
anything you can tell us about night
vision
uh i mean like
we've got some kind of uh we've got
different scope features planned for the
future so like uh
different manufacturers basically have
different tech levels like we want to do
things like infrared night vision like
other features like some of you like
we'll even call out targets like based
off like the your uh fps radar and
scanning stuff and then this also ties
into a little bit into the different
visors on different helmets for
different suits so like eventually we'll
want different gameplay purposes
surrounding those like the support suit
that we talked about earlier if you've
got all of that stuff on you might
actually get some additional health
readouts for people in the environment
without having to bring up your you know
healing weapon or if you're wearing an
environment suit you might get more
environmental data and that kind of ties
into that as well so if you have some
more specialist suits we can tie some of
that gameplay onto the visor as well
uh handgun holsters and other equipment
slots for regular clothing things not
like flight suits do you want to walk
around with my pistol
i'm not going to be committed to this
because i've been talking about this the
character art team and it's something
that we want to do so if i say equip a
pistol i then get a holster for my
pistol on my clothing i know people
really really really want functional
clothing and it's something i've been
talking to tarden people about
in terms of we want to move into a
direction where clothing is more useful
because people want to use it uh this
obviously ties into that so it's like
holsters bundles things like that seeing
how far we can go without uh
creating too much work for our for our
character artists
all right and last but not least
titan suit what can you tell us oh i'm
sorry we're out of time
