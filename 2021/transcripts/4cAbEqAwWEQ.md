in star citizen we have
many of these huge intricate planets and
the way that we've been able to do that
is instead of storing each vertice of
the planet like you would in a
traditional level editor we store height
maps and other data about the planet
and then build chunks of the planet
around the player
but it did introduce the problem of us
not being able to edit individual
vertices of the terrain
that is where the terrain modification
system comes in
[Music]
so the terrain modification system works
by placing
modifiers across the planet and when we
build each chunk of the terrain
we check to see if any of the vertices
intercept one of our bounding boxes and
if we do
that modifier applies a function to the
z coordinate
of that vertices to offset it to a
specific place that we choose
so for example we've got here a
smoothing area we can move this around
we can see that it is smoothing out the
ground we can raise it or lower it we
can change its size and so on
and here i've got a crater which we
could flip
and turn into a push pull we can change
the scale and so on
and that's all happening by intercepting
the mesh building system
and applying offsets based on a function
to each vertex within that box we can
use this
on any scale we like so from a very
small scale like this
to a much bigger scale like this over
here so if i decide i want to place my
my outpost over here the first thing i
do is i put a smoothing area down
i integrate that into the terrain so
that it looks good and play with all the
different settings to
tweak the roll off and the radius of the
smoothing area
and then i can go in and i can put my
outpost down
and we can see that that's come in very
flat there's no clipping with the
terrain
and it all looks very natural and
embedded instead of kind of like
terrain clipping over the sides of the
landing pads
so we can integrate our smoothing areas
even more in with the terrain
by using a noisy edge instead of just
having
a perfectly spherical one so this
smoothing area here
has a noise function applied to its
radius so we get this kind of like
crinkly effect and when i embed that
into the ground we don't see an obvious
circle
around where our outpost is instead we
get more natural looking
crinkle around the edge of our smoothing
area
the reason that we have both of these
modifiers is sometimes you want to make
it clear
that humanity has come and shaped the
terrain to be a certain way
and sometimes you just want the
convenience of
flat ground without it looking like it's
been bulldozed by
a great big group of jcbs so using the
same
modification system we can actually add
water meshes
to the vertexes the first thing i did on
this was a way to place river paths
because you can't start modifying the
terrain before you know where the water
is going to flow
so i've got this river placement tool
here where we're going to be able to
essentially start off by placing a
spring
or somewhere where the water might come
out of the ground so i'm going to
place that here and you can see that it
automatically starts working out the
path
of where the water would flow now it
does this in steps
it looks at the direction that the water
is coming from
it takes a step in that direction and
works out an arc of points
and then it chooses the point on that
arc that is the lowest
moves there and then continues on to the
next step
until you get this nice flowing path
now over here we've got a white dot and
that is because
the lowest point on the arc was in fact
higher than the water started with
and if you look at a river you'll notice
water doesn't travel up
so here the point is white because we're
going to have to erode down the path
under here for the water to have
traveled
to this point we can't have it flow up
on the terrain
so once we're happy with our river path
we can look at adding any contributing
springs so for example we might have a
bit more water flow coming from there
or i might choose to have a bit more
water flow coming from there
and then we can score and clean the
rivers
what this does is it works out a more
detailed path between the nodes that the
river is going to take
and it also works out how much water is
going to be passing through
each point so you see if i click on this
node here we can see the size is 5.
if i go a little bit downstream where
there's going to be more rainwater
collecting into the stream
the size is 17 and that will increase
all the way down to the bottom where the
reference
once we're happy with the river system
as a whole we can place
the geometry modifiers now the first
thing this is going to do
is we've placed some brown decals down
to show that the terrain has changed
and we've actually modified the terrain
to show the path of the river as you can
see if i just turn these off
as you can see we've got a deep trench
where the river is flowing and then
banks around the river
but usually rivers have water so
let's add in some water now obviously
this is work in progress this is just
using the sea mesh
but it just to prove the concept that we
can have water
in the basis of our rivers but it still
doesn't look quite right
if you look at a river in the wild going
through any ecosystem whether it be a
forest or some fields or a desert
you'll notice that the terrain around it
is different and that's because
the water influences the ecosystem we
get more vegetation
and growth around places where there are
water so
in order to make this look as convincing
as possible we're going to experiment
with
adding more foliage and more ecosystem
changes around the rivers
so this is just a programmer's take on
this and no artists have had any say in
what i'm doing here
so by borrowing a slightly more lush
preset from a different planet we can
see that we can create this really
effective look around the rivers with
far more trees and ground cover
just to really sell the idea that this
is a river that has been here for
thousands of years and is flowing
through the hills of microtech
so now that we've added in this
ecosystem around the river it really
sells
and looks like a river flowing through
the hills of microtech
this looks much more like something
that's been here for thousands of years
instead of just a bit of water that's
trickling down some hills
obviously when the artists take a pass
at this they'll be able to get some much
more suitable foliage and vegetation
instead of
having this awkward merge between snowy
trees and beautiful lush foliage
but the fact that we've got the tools to
do this and we can do it procedurally
just with a few clicks
means that these rivers could be
cropping up soon on the planets
as a reminder this is a working
prototype not a finished product and
these are all
engineer art choices rather than artist
art choices
i can imagine someone screaming at me
for the fact that we've got some
beautiful kind of tropical
trees here versus some snowy pines in
the backdrop
but the fact that we can modify the
ecosystem around these rivers
means that we're going to be able to
create some really convincing looking
ecosystems
[Music]
the terrain modification tool is just
one more way the planet tech team
continues to create new technologies
that help our artists and designers
create assets for the star citizen
universe better
and more quickly than ever before now
citizens that have been around for a
while know that january
is planning season where developers get
together
review the lessons of the year before
and plan out their efforts for the one
ahead
now by the time that this airs that
process is still in full swing for many
teams
but we took the opportunity to chat with
some of the folks that participated in
this year's
combat summit to get a sense of where
their conversations went
and check in before they go heads down
and the process of prototyping begins
so the theme of this year's combat
summit was really how we give the player
control over all the systemic features
we have in the game
what we want is an environment where
things make sense
that choice allows players to approach
different missions and different
scenarios
in different ways and even the same
scenario in different ways which really
expands the feel and the options players
have
the main reason why we created a combat
summit was to include
more people from multiple departments of
the company that have a stake or an
interest in space combat
it helps like gather outside data into
one kind of
focus point we can kind of figure out
the
core problems that we have and also you
know
to kind of come up with solutions for
those problems
it's very important to to go away and
come up with
different solutions test them out see
which ones are fun see which ones play
well with other features
since last year's summit was so
successful we're really we're in a good
position to go forward into this year's
summit
building upon the work we did on the
last one
and this is combat summit we talked a
lot about combat geometry
which is how ships fly around each other
during combat how they're going to fight
each other
one of the ways we wanted to improve the
current flight model
was with the addition of capacitors
which will make the
actions players take during a dogfight
more meaningful
and have more of an impact on what they
see and what they do and capacitors
really do that by sort of
capping some of the behaviors as well as
giving you an
instant visual result and instant flight
result
we went into weapons and the different
behaviors of weapons and how they
interact with shields and ballistic
armor
we're not aiming for like a meter build
gameplay right we want
each weapon to feel different and to
have a different role in space combat
and then to add to this we're discussing
how we kind of move the roles forward on
the ships and make the most of the
features that we have to you know kind
of realize the rules on ships
and for those to mean more in the pu you
know as far as what choices you make of
what ship you want
i'm very excited to get some of those
sort of ironed out and to get those
feelings of those ships so that you know
without looking
at the label of the ship that you're
definitely in something like a light
fighter
we're just focusing on how to make those
roles
mean more to the players so they can
make more meaningful informed decisions
so it was a really important discussion
on those things and they all kind of
relate to one another
and we have to move them together
forward um in one kind of
you know line really because that gives
us the best kind of maneuverability
moving forward to understand really
the impact of these changes as well
so now we have a big bunch of work in
front of us right we have action points
what we want to do
so the next step for us is prototyping a
big risk when you're prototyping several
solutions is the fact that
one might not fit with another solution
but we cannot tell right away
which of these measures are going to
work and which won't
so when we're testing it's very
important that we're testing all these
features together to make sure that
we're picking the right solution
and that fits together as a package for
us
now we'll learn more about the resulting
new features that arise from the combat
summit throughout the remainder of this
year
as they're being developed can i show
you one more thing that i've been
messing around with
uh sure will just uh don't get me in
trouble
uh so here i've put together our
grenade launcher with a crater
modifier just to see what we could do
with this
and now when i fire a grenade launcher
we get a nice little dent in the terrain
where i fired it
we can essentially go and create some
craters obviously this is
this is me messing around this isn't
something that's in game
but just something that i've been having
a little bit of fun with and
hopefully we'll be able to use something
like this in the future but no
no promises this is just a bit of fun so
what did we learn about this week
well we learned the plateaus can be a
good thing when they allow designers to
place outposts anywhere they want
that a river may run through it but the
next step is to always
always always replace that programmer
art that each summit builds upon the
successes of the last
and that the work of honing star
citizen's combat experience
continues for inside star citizen i'm
jared huckaby
we'll see you all next week
