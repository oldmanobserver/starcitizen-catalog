[Music]
for me when it comes to exploring
areas in a game i tend to prefer when
i've earned something
so when you've had to fight to get past
some people to get somewhere
you expect that to be something cool to
find something to make
it worthwhile
[Music]
there are just some things that you just
don't go and buy in a store
things that you have to go out and find
that's i feel one of the most important
aspects of gaming
[Applause]
i've often found that if there's no
tangible reward whether it's something
that you bring away from there
or something that you find that maybe
leads to something else to discover
that something can be lost in the
experience of exploration
imagine you go into some dungeon you're
excited to explore and there's npcs
there just kind of standing around but
there's nothing to find
there's there's crates but they're empty
there's
storage with nothing in it not only is
it disappointing from a gameplay
perspective you don't get
any of the cool loot you were hoping for
but it just doesn't make sense what were
all these people doing there
with no food no supplies nothing
you want there to be something amazing
at the end
so we're working on this new system
called
loot generation we have built this
system
on the foundation of the harvestable
system
which is going to empower our designers
to set up
locations all across the verse
to be filled with dynamically generated
loot
they function using a system we've
called loot archetypes which
are on the fly generated sets of tags
so the idea is that a designer can lay
out
a list of uh tags that they want
items in the loop pool to match and then
maybe some that they don't so you can
say i want
i want things that are tagged with
weapon but not
things that are tagged with ammunition
and then what really makes it powerful
is it's not just a uniform
distribution of okay we have all of
these potential items just pick one at
random
when the designers are specifying tags
to use they can assign a weight
to each one and say i want rifles with a
weight of five and i want pistols with a
weight of ten
so you're twice as likely to get a
pistol in this crunch
so we have like full control over
how many items spawn uh what
specifically spawns we could even
if we wanted to and i've actually been
doing the tagging for this myself
we could actually tell a loot archetype
hey spawn me a bunch of armor that's red
your loot archetype could have the
weapon.fps.rifle tag
as an example and that would then give
you the option of all of the weapons
that
spawn underneath that or that are
populated underneath that tag structure
and you may then have armor.fps.heavy
which would give you all of the
selection of the heavy armors under that
and then it could be gadget.medkit
so you would then have a loot archetype
that says give me any rifle
or any heavy piece of armor or any med
kit
it's been a lot of work to get it
working that way but all of it sort of
works in conjunction with each other
and with some of the future stuff coming
down the pipe as well
such as quanta the loot generation
system actually
will read from the parent object
containers that we use
in in the game at the moment so say your
spawning containers on hurston
your main object container would be
hurston and then let's say you've got
loreville which would be
l19 and then inside that you might have
uh let's say that we expand the city and
there's like a
an abandoned hovel underneath that's
maybe
occupied by pirates if qanta decides oh
okay so
authorities came cleared that place out
that place is now no longer a pirate
base it's now
storage site for hurston dynamics then
all of the containers in that
area then might switch to be containing
hursting equipment
qanta can then determine way up the
chain way at the top
this is how things are now happening
because ai has moved in
things have happened things have changed
and
the the the archetypes and the the loot
generation system
reacts on the fly to that so if qanta
was to decide
this planet has been raided it's been
full of conflict there's been
wars here like people are leaving in
droves because it's not safe to be here
anymore
the the status of that planet the
richness of that planet
lowers as well to the point where then
the loot generation system says okay
where most of these containers might
have been 50 to 60 percent full as they
were
now we're only going to fill them up to
like 20 to 30
it's all about adapting on the fly to
where you're at what you're doing and
seeing what can be so where we're at
right now is
we've got a pretty solid base for
internal testing
we're trying out marking up a few
different locations
with some containers mainly filled with
weapons and armor at the moment
but we are hoping to expand that to
other items in the future
and we hope that it provides an
immersive experience more than anything
else
that people can get excited about this
sort of thing that they know that when
they go to a planet once they might go
back a few weeks later and it's just
completely different
[Music]
loot is an essential part of any mmo and
when it arrives later this year
it'll be one more step towards
fulfilling the the exploration based
promise of star citizen's persistent
universe
but up next we've got a special oops
it's
all bfx edition of the sprint report so
let's get to it
to start things off this week if you
remember from our last sprint report
we showed how the team had been working
on an update to the thruster
dust system that converts the existing
particles from a radial effect
to a directional one that's actually
based on the thruster direction to any
surface normal
it may be hitting at any given moment
now this causes the effect to change not
only by the raycast angle being
perpendicular or parallel to the surface
but also the strength of the thruster
output the type of surface itself
and the force of the surrounding wind
volume and you can see here
how that check has progressed in the
weeks since we showed it
now while this update showcases the
progress made since then and
still has a little ways to go folks are
already thinking about the myriad of
tactical uses this feature might have in
things like the
upcoming jump town 2 over bodies of
water like rivers and oceans
and even against the soft body objects
like those seen in the upcoming
colonialism outposts
alpha 314 sees the initial
implementation of orisin
but the work doesn't stop there and
coming up in a subsequent patch
the vfx team is currently working on
tech that uses vector fields around the
player character's feet
to disturb the various piles of cherry
blossom leaves
that tend to accumulate around the
commercial and residential areas
now while the first implementation of
this tech will be orisin
the team is already looking ahead to
utilizing it in other areas
including on vehicles so let your
imaginations run wild with that one
all right not that wild and while we're
talking leaves
the team recently completed a sprint
adding rotation effects
to gpu screen space colliding particles
utilizing the velocity of an object
to determine the amount and size of turn
applied to leaves
making for a much more organic looking
effect as they
blow over the edge of a surface and fall
to wherever down below
and we're pleased to report that this
feature was working so nicely
it actually just went into ptu builds
last week for alpha 314.
currently in the persistent universe
weapon impacts on ships
occur in what's called the ship zone
which causes the impact effects like
sparks and such to stick to the ship
meaning it essentially gets carried
along with it as it moves forward
which looks unnatural but in a recent
sprint
this was remedied so that now the
effects trail behind as the ship moves
away from the original point of impact
much as one would expect them to now
it's a little thing
but at the core of building an immersive
universe are hundreds and hundreds of
little things
adding up to a universe that functions
or behaves in believable and expected
ways
and here's a second look at the same
system in atmo
where you can see the sparks fly up into
the air against gravity in the old
system
and now falling down to the surface as
you'd expect them to
in the new the vfx team is also
exploring
several different destruction mosaics
for the space station orbiting above
in the crossroads of crime map for
theaters of war
since these destructions being explored
are simulation based in the houdini
software
these mosaics utilizing various factors
of stiffness and damping ratio
allow for a degree of art direction not
normally available
plus it just kind of looks cool to see
all the different ways the thing can
explode
you know
also always cool lightning now
previously
lightning across our games suffered from
a number of different maladies
including poor performance and poor
scaling effects
but due to recent r d by the team and
the use of
instanced scale multipliers and ribbons
the team has not only found a way to
author these same effects at a wide
range of scales
but the use of ribbons reduces the need
for high particle counts in the runtime
gpu particle system
what's that mean it means more
developers can use more lightning in
more
areas without destroying their
performance budget and that's especially
good news
for the upcoming pyro system and the
visual revamp to the dying star map and
arena commander that's currently
underway
and wrapping up our look at vfx this
week the team has returned from a brief
hiatus away from fire propagation
to create their version of a concept a
cinematic look dev if you will
at the goals for fire propagation
utilizing the tech
features and progress already in hand
what you see
here is a basic electrical fire in a
relatively high
tech environment exploring the type of
propagation effects the team are
currently pursuing
now as a test exclusively for how the
fire moves
and spreads throughout the ship there
are still a number of limiting visual
factors here
like the still outstanding shader work
that will one day make the fire feel
even more alive than it already does
as the fire moves across the white
surface that is flammable
you can see it dripping down to ignite
the same surface below
while interacting with the black
glass-like surface on the ceiling
that is understandably resistant
combined with the heat and noxious gases
affecting players via the actor's status
system
it's an exciting look ahead at some of
the new dangers and hazards
players will encounter and have to deal
with on a regular basis
as star citizens development continues
but before we let you go let's jump
ahead and see what happens when you
ignore the fire
and let it go about its business for
about half an hour
[Music]
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that while it's fine to go into
a store and buy something from the
vendor
there's still something about
discovering the item while adventuring
that can make it just a little more
special that the work on orizon
doesn't end with alpha 314 and that
we'll be seeing more of what's coming
as this quarter progresses and just when
i think i'm out
those advances to fire propagation pull
me back in
now remember this quarter we're on the
road to digital citizen gun
where all kinds of panels and content
await for hours full of star citizen
goodness
that's october 9th so mark your
calendars for inside star citizen i'm
jared huckaby
we'll see you all next week
you
