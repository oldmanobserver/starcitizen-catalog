in 315 we are delivering hospitals for
the players of star citizen
for me the healing loop is something
that's gonna
have a big impact on the way we play
especially in co-op
we ended up creating this drop-off point
where you can carry your injured friend
it sort of looks like an elevator with a
gurney in the middle so if you have
a big crew and everybody has had a bad
day then you can keep feeding them to
the machine
one of the interesting challenge about
building hospitals is obviously that we
have to build them for a purpose that
isn't there yet and so what we did on
the design side we were very involved
with the actor feature team in
what is the healing loop going to be
like and and what are the requirements
that we have to factor in in our
location so we decided that we need some
pharmacies where you can purchase meds
we need also insurance shop where you
can set your respawn position
we need also like a completely new way
of approaching um
rooms reservation we know we get a sign
a room in the habitation when we spawn
but now we do it the other way around
where you go into a location and you
reserve a room from the lobby and we
didn't have that flow before so we had
to develop all of that uh
to support the
all the the mechanics that are implied
with the healing
for 3 15 we introduce four hospitals
origin
base clinic
grimex
and new babbage
as you enter new baptist hospital you'll
see right away
what i think is one of the really cool
feature of this hospital is that there's
this glass ceiling
above you that allows you to really take
in the vista and if you look behind you
you'll see the aspire grande tower where
the abs are
you're going to find your reception
on your right hand side and you're going
to find all your shop and services needs
on your left hand side and really from
there all you have to do is keep going
straight to the other half where the
elevators are and
then it takes you to the medical floors
i specifically worked on the upper
floors of the hospital that's where the
player will be able to check in at the
nurse's desk spawned in at the medical
room
in my opinion this hospital shines
horizon
is really big
super high ceiling really open and super
clean too you have like the reception
right in front of you and the service is
a bit behind
and then
the elevators they take you higher up
as you go out of the elevator then the
player will pass through and see this
absolutely gorgeous wind sculpture there
and seeing those big
whale passing through the clouds in
front of you
as you're in those medical bed um
feel special it feels different
and then we have the space clinics they
still offer all the same services that
you would find in a
larger hospital it's just that
everything is more
compact we're creating modules and
different pieces of the space clinic so
that way every time you experience it
it'll be just a little bit different and
you'll still get the same feeling
we always try to place them near the
the elevators that takes you to the
anger so that whether you come in after
you're being injured or whether you're
walking out and you're in a hurry to go
back in space
it's easy and convenient so you walk in
there it's again
very clean but
much less so than horizon obviously it
has more like this kind of low-tech vibe
to it
these ones i i expect them to be
fairly popular because they're just so
convenient
remax if it had a smell it would smell
like
[Music]
like like a sport bag or something like
that
low tech is not as clean as new barb or
horizon me personally
it's the best it's much smaller it's
more like on the clinic size so there's
not a big elevator to go through as we
all know innovators are the biggest
killers in game development so it's a
good thing that we skipped one there
it has this really nice view to the
asteroid field outside
and the cool thing is that you can also
land your ship right next to a side
entrance to the clinic so if you're in a
hurry and you don't want to go and park
in a hangar or into the traversal you
can park right next to it get out walk
in
and get treated but the thing is like
it's open space right so your ship is
exposed while you do that and you could
very well
see a pirate fly in and shoot at your
ship as you're getting fixed yourself
and really this kind of
emergent like interaction is really
what makes a game shine i think the
hospitals are part of a game changer
when people leave the hospital and they
wake up and they explore around i think
they're really going to see like
the love and care we put into each
crevice and corner
i hope that the hospitals are going to
be a way to wrap up the full healing
loop honestly if the players find them
convenient me as a designer i might be
my job this
time hospitals are the next major
offering from our team in montreal and
serve as harbinger of the the next major
advancement in player healing from the
actor feature team scheduled to come
online in the upcoming alpha 315 and
while we'll be learning more about how
all that works in the coming weeks let's
shift gears now to spaceships
specifically aegis stalwarts the gladius
saber and retaliator and find out what
it what it really means to be the gold
standard in a pipeline that is
continuously evolving to this day and
beyond
the gold standard pass is what we are
terming
this current pass on the vehicles
[Music]
we are implementing primarily cockpit
button placements could be button
animations
making sure everything is to metric both
character and item-wise
exposing all the ship items lighting
passes material passes
gold standard is finishing the ship to
as complete as standard as we can with
the feature set that we have right now
in the game
the first ship that we put through this
pass was the aegis gladius i was a
little nervous working on the gladius
because it is like the star squadron and
um you know i wanted to make sure i did
a good job on it and then also coupled
with the fact that because squadron are
using it i had to make sure that i
didn't break anything with each submit
so they can keep working on squadron and
um
you know story with the test and work on
it we started off with adding component
hatches and a personal inventory
gliders didn't seem to have any like
visible
headlight source so i went in and added
like some nice big headlights for that
at the front
and then it was just the legs that like
with the thruster glows as well trying
to get them to look nice and read from a
distance
adding the fuel port on it as well
and then yeah just like some geo
optimizations and material optimizations
and more stuff that you don't
necessarily would see but makes the game
you know more optimized and runs better
so on the next ship which was the sabre
um we we built on what we learned from
the gladius and
did that in the sabre
for instance the damage mesh like damage
mesh could
needed a bit of tweaking we added and a
bunch of lighting so you can
uh still read the ship from afar but not
make it too bright as it's still a
stealth ship and after the whole
exterior was done and thus that we moved
under a revision of the dashboard
overall just reworking so it's not as
noisy and now you have like a better
view of like your cockpit and then just
everything nice and compact to the sides
in a couple of sentences a really rough
overview of the saber gold standard
process
so the retaliator gold standard is
obviously a much larger task than the
the glaciers and saber has all the same
criteria of work so looking at the
cockpit looking at the components adding
all the things checking everything so
metric but because it's got an interior
then there's additional tasks added so
that the same work we do for the cockpit
of the pilot has to be done for the
turrets um
the components that you can physically
take out of the ship
can you physically take them out of the
ship
do the doors need to be wider et cetera
now you've made the doors wider do they
still fit in the ship when they open and
we also took the time to looked at the
central room and thought
can we improve on this we decided to
remove the top and bottom ducking
collars and go for a side airlock which
also helps for docking because that's
just a natural walking on transition and
then because we'd lost a
a lift on that side we then
realized we had to make the lift on the
other side slightly larger to
accommodate essentially two lifts worth
of people so then you've now just got
one lift on that side of the ship to get
in and a
docking collar on the other side to get
in
thing that the retaliator has is the
customizable room modules and there's a
cargo module front and back
a drop ship module at the front
they were all brought up to current
standards
so when a modularity comes on as a
swappable item they are good to
go that's where we're at with the the
first gold standard ships obviously
going to go through all the ships but we
are going to focus on the ones that
feature heavily in squadron 42 first and
then we will roll on to
your favorite ship afterwards so what
did we learn this week
well we learned that hospitals are the
vanguard of new player healing mechanics
coming to star citizen that that look to
to change the way we live
and die in the persistent universe
that much like the planet tech even the
spaceships that we've had and flown
thousands of times continue to improve
and evolve as new technologies come
online
and that elevators truly are the most
dangerous killer in the game development
kingdom
they only let me work jungle cruise once
but i killed it
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
you
