hey everybody welcome to star citizen
live
spider-man
i'm italian spider-man i'm your host
jared huckaby uh it's halloween weekend
and i
i didn't feel like doing count disco
this year so so
this is this is what you end up with
sorry everybody
uh welcome to star citizen live game dev
outlaw lifestyle uh if you've never seen
star citizen live before it's where we
take about an hour out of the end of our
week hang out with our developers and
either discuss a little bit of our
development or showcase a little bit of
our development
this week's episode is a little
different uh
if you remember from citizencon uh that
just like two weeks ago i think uh we
had a whole bunch of different showcases
going on one of those was a lovely uh
uh josh van zulen uh showing his process
of creating the
interiors of the outlaw space stations
now josh because he came prepared and is
wonderful at his job created an entire
hour-long presentation for us and then
when we fit it in with the rest of the
day we're like you got five minutes you
got five minutes so we uh we slaughtered
the heck out of that set out of that
that segment for for sizzicon but he's
back he's back today uh where's where's
my screen saying josh how you doing man
doing all right how are you doing man
i i i'm
bring me
i considered doing the voice the entire
time and i'm like no that's that's
i was about to say like i was kind of
expecting it but no no no no no
all right so so josh uh outlaw space
stations are
a big uh feature of the upcoming pyro
system um
they are they are uh
some of the they're few and far between
in the system but
so that means that when you encounter
them they're incredibly important they
are they are life throughout the verse
so uh at this point because
this is your show here uh i'm gonna turn
it over to you let's just jump right
into it uh what are we doing today
sure absolutely so um for those of you
who who didn't tune in to sitcon um i'm
josh vanzalin principal environment
artist here at cloud imperium games and
basically what we're gonna do is we're
going to expand on
that talk that we did at sitcon a little
bit so it was only like a tiny snippet
of what we really had there so we're
gonna tread like some of the same ground
but it's going to make a lot more sense
in the broad scheme of things
and uh we're going to go into a lot more
depth in regards to the actual
development process
uh figuring out how we actually start
these locations and build them out
and
figure out kind of
these really key aspects along the way
so like certain things like
uh figuring out
uh
what the art direction is for a starting
point right so we have key bits of art
that we're trying to actually establish
and uh then reapply that into the actual
game setting
and then finding out where there are
holes within the art style itself so
maybe the concept team or the art
director hadn't necessarily thought
about how
the art style would work in this one
particular instance or how it would
particularly combine with the game
design that we're actually needing to
put in there because we are making a
game
and then also figuring out not only the
um
only the just the general workflow for
the location but what the limitations
are in terms of what tech we have
available to us
how much physical stuff we can put in
the location and uh then just like
figuring out those real
problem areas where we're going to run
into issues and then address those and
then react to those and then try and
find you know creative solutions to to
problems so this is the the earliest
part of the development process
just after concept art so this is
pre-production on the actual location
and um
basically everything you'll see here is
not
basic it's not exactly what you'll see
in the final product but it is a very
solid foundation for figuring out what
we actually will need to do
and some of this stuff will actually
survive well and truly into into the
final
product for sure
um
this is my first time seeing this for a
while so it's it's a little bit of a
nostalgia trip because uh uh it's moved
on quite a bit from that from this point
but um it's there's still a lot of
elements that are fairly similar right
so it's not a wasted opportunity or time
within development's actually incredibly
critical for figuring out how we can
build these things in a time efficient
manner
as efficiently as possible
and whatnot so
without further ado let's just dig in
right
so
what you can see here on on my screen
right now is something we're all fairly
familiar with this is the stanton
systems
rest stops so one of the food courts
here what we're going to do is we're
actually going to use this as a base
the the idea here being that we can take
um well the pirate system which is and
has a lot older space stations here
maybe they were developed by the same
corporation and whatnot and they're not
you know every corporation tries to save
money here or there um
and
they've used the exact same module in
the sensor system or in pirate or vice
versa whichever came first
uh the pyro systems ones being not as
well maintained of course but
this is going to be our base so we're
going to see how we can start to get
some easy wins without having to
completely redesign uh all of the
modules that work already with our
procedural system right so what we're
going to do
um and fingers crossed this doesn't
crash is i'm going to turn off this
version
and um just quickly
i'm going to delete it
and then
get rid of alright as well by alright
and then turn on our one so
this is kind of what we opened on at
sitcom so this is
basically the exact same thing but what
we've done is we've grabbed every single
brush or mesh within the scene and
dragged up the wear to the maximum level
on it right so the idea here being that
we needed to really see
whether or not we needed to go in and
make a brand new material set for all of
these panels on the sides here or
whether or not we can get away with just
using the existing texture sets right
it's it's the question of do we actually
have to invest
time and resources into developing
something that could potentially take
months of work for an artist or can we
just use what we already have
and fortunately so far uh the answer is
we can pretty much use exactly what
we've got here so far right there's a
few little additions here or there which
we'll get into a little bit later on
where you can see that we've uh had to
go in and make a few more materials but
it's substantially less than what we
would have had to if we were making a
brand new material set right so
cool so that's basically where we are
here what we've done is we've gone
through and we've just stripped out all
of this essential or all of the prop
work that was done in here originally
and we're just trying to keep it uh down
to its original shell as much as
possible
another thing on top of this is what
we've done is that we identified pretty
early on that uh the the optimization in
this area could have been a lot better
and so we've gone in and we've actually
uh tightened up a lot of the things
especially around this center area here
so we've we've added a lot of things
like we've added these areas basically
and these areas is is how we kind of
control occlusion volumes within our
game you'll see a lot more of that
further as we go on as well but this was
one of the things we super early found
out about
and just addressed here so
these will um
at this level run a lot nicer than the
old ones but uh we're putting a lot more
into these so ultimately it's a
balancing act right
cool so
from this point uh we're going to start
to try and establish some of the the key
concept art that we had so
what
what we were identified really quickly
with this stuff is that
it's really important to start from
a base of just like
complete darkness when you're when
you're building these things so right
now i've got it's got working lights on
and i'll show you exactly why right so
um
up here we have all of this roof
that is
quite easily visible with the working
lights on but ultimately when we're
actually
in the game with the correct lighting so
if i turn on the lighting
and turn off our working lights
you can see that we can't see the roof
at all
so
this is super important because that
means that we don't need to spend you
know days and days modeling all of this
intricate kind of pipe work and
machinery that we can go and put up in
the roof right we can just let it fall
into darkness
and and it's pretty good right
worst case scenario if we did find that
we needed to like do some dressing work
there we can do some minimal work but
it's mostly in darkness so we we get
away from it right it's about spending
the time where you need to spend the
time
so
we're getting a lot of mood that's
coming through right here right now and
this is very close to what we had in in
one of the concepts that we were looking
at
what we've got is a big key light big
area key light coming up from the top
left here that's just shooting through
everything we've got some particles
happening some rain
and we've got a little bit of fire over
the side here which is just floating out
in space
so
this is already starting to look nice
we've got another light over here the
idea here was that
we didn't want the light to touch the
second level we wanted to keep it in
this level so
as these two levels start to meld
together in terms of lighting because
we're actually going to have a market
down here
you're going to get a whole bunch of
like warmth and different colors down
the bottom and then you're going to get
this stark cold difference uh with the
area above because these space stations
are
they're pretty much not working right
the life support isn't there there's
absolutely no utilities and there's
pretty much no lighting right and the
lighting that is there is like only
being held together with duct tape
pretty much
so
in general everything's really cold
apart from where people are trying to
live and those places are premium real
estate right
so
um
moving on from that
we're going to go in and we're just
going to add in a little bit of dressing
with some cables here so
this is just adding in a little bit more
of that you know reinforcing the fact
that they've had to go in and
jerry-rigged this thing to make it you
know remotely habitable right by snaking
through all of these cables throughout
the entire space station to you know
maybe power heaters
powered portable life support systems or
or anything of the sort right maybe it's
just an open like one of the automatic
doors that needs to have
power powered to it right so they're
sneaking all these things from temporary
generators all the way through the
location right
so that's what we're thinking about here
um and then another thing and this is
what i mentioned before is that um
this
right now this picture here apart from
the glows that we're getting from the
marketplace is pretty much straight on
point with with the concept art that we
were given for the location but one
thing that was not accounted for in the
concept art is that
this area as a marketplace
is going to have this dynamic between
the normal people downstairs at the
market who are buying and selling stuff
and then the gang who is actually
controlling
these locations right so we wanted to
create this structure where
the people down the bottom are not
oppressed but like there's this ever
looming gang presence
that they're there right so the gangs
are all up in this top area
and uh have kind of made it like their
main hideout
so
yes i'm sorry before you go do you want
to explain the rain
at this point
okay yeah i can explain the rain
this will become a little bit more
apparent as as we start like turning
things on later on but the rain is uh
this as a disclaimer it's way too
intense right now right
and um
the idea is that this is um there's such
a stark kind of heat difference or
temperature difference in this space
when we have the market downstairs and
uh this huge volume basically we have
all of the steam from the markets people
cooking things and whatnot all rising up
to the roof and then condensing on uh
the roof itself bits of machinery lots
of the go to work or or cables and
whatnot and uh then just slowly dripping
down and
ultimately potentially being collected
by by the people living in the station
right because water is a valuable
resource
and
basically
it needs to well obviously it wouldn't
be as intense as it is right now but
also we want to introduce a little bit
of frost into it as well because some of
it would technically freeze as it comes
down because it's cold enough
um so this is basic the reason why we've
got this here is that we can just
explore that idea and see how it would
feel within a space like this and it's a
mental note as well to the the vfx team
that when they come in and do their pass
because vfx haven't touched this this is
just me finding particle systems
randomly throughout our library
the vfx guys can go in and go oh they
want rain here okay i'll hit up the the
artist why they did that and then we can
figure out the logic behind it and then
they can do a feasible
particle effect for it right right it's
basically a marker for some for another
team down the line to be like hey you
need to fix this
yeah absolutely and to just validate it
with with art direction and and cr right
because ultimately if if you show this
to
the to the directors and they go what
what the hell why is there rain that's
so stupid
then i want to know about it as early as
possible right because this dictates a
lot of the the work that goes into the
environment narratively and artistically
so
sorry for derailing you can go it's all
right
um
but yeah so
in terms of the gang upstairs
one of the things we need to do is we
need to just create a gated experience
for those guys where
if you are not of a certain reputation
with the gang you don't have access to
those spaces right so
one of those things is adding in a
checkpoint over here so if you're in
favor with the gang you'll be able to go
through this checkpoint if you're not in
favor then you won't
um you'll probably get attacked you
probably shouldn't be on the station to
begin with if you're not in favor um if
you're neutral then
you won't get in but they won't kill you
right
so anyways it's kind of just a strong
point for them to defend their main hub
which is going to be behind them here so
what i've gone in and done is just take
one of our existing catwalk sets so i'm
going to turn on our working light so we
can see it a little bit better
uh so this is an existing catwalk set
that we've already had with within the
game at the moment and the reason we're
using this because it's a little bit too
chunky at the moment it's just to feel
out whether or not this is something
that we can you know viably use
uh in in this space right now or if we
have to actually make a brand new
catwalk set right
and
what we've discovered is that this is
actually a little bit too chunky to like
a little bit too substantial for the
gang to actually use within this
location
and uh so
we've actually taken measures now in
development where we're having artists
go in and make alterations to the set so
that we can make it look a little bit
more
haphazardly put together
right without a professional installer
coming in and doing this for them right
so this was a very important thing to
kind of establish and figure out
is this something we can get away with
the answer is not really so we're we're
going in and making it adjustments to
that right
so
past this we're going to go in and add a
little bit more dressing work here so
one of the one of the artistic intents
that we established really early on in
production is that um
ian the art director really didn't want
to see the walls as much as possible so
um you'll see a little bit more of this
as i go in but we're starting to cover
it up with a lot more of these soft
surface elements right which is also
relating a lot more to
the culture that we have on the the
planets themselves like you would have
seen like there's a lot quite a lot of
soft surface elements inside the outputs
that we have on those planets
as well
so it's kind of like creating a
relationship here as well but it also
helps us cover up a lot of the original
walls within the space station itself
right so we're adding in a lot more of
that what we've gone in and done as well
is adding in like these like kind of
barriers that kind of keep like kind of
a bunker vibe from inside so you get
like a little slot here which you can
shoot through and a few cover points
here
where they could potentially take
someone out who was charging in if a
gang takeover decided to take place
right
so we got a few of those things
um i'm going to turn off our lights
get that mood back in
and then so
now generally during this process i'd be
doing a lighting pass but for the sake
of simplicity here i'm just going to
turn it on
so this is the lighting that we've gone
for the in for this place in particular
one of the things that
we wanted to get across here is that
it's
not a comfortable place to really be
standing um as is as is evident by my
little um
scene here with the scale refs
so one of the ways that we've done that
is by introducing these red lights
around the place and um these are
actually serve double duty these are
also portable heaters so they're keeping
people warm within the cold environment
but they also give us that little bit of
red light which is a little bit menacing
right
on top of that we've got floodlights
that are just like blinding people as
they come around and there's a lot of
forward-facing lights on the actual
uh checkpoint itself right
so we're kind of creating this really
cool mood
and uh ultimately
trying not to impact the original
keyframe with our concept art too much
which is it's being fairly successful
here we're getting a little bit of a
call out with the light but it's
actually not too bad so we're actually
being fairly successful in this regard
cool
so
on top of that
there's there's still a few things
missing
from this image in particular so i
mentioned that we wanted to not see the
walls as much right
and one of the ways that we're doing
that on on power stations is through the
use of like uh graffiti right and we've
used graffiti a little bit in the game
so far but we've not used graffiti to
the same degree that we're going to be
using graffiti here so
we wanted to
um
basically
cover everything in graffiti the
graffiti you're gonna see right here
take it with a pinch of salt it's not
like the actual
final art stuff this is just stuff that
we've thrown in just to see if what
the way we envisioned it would work
would work so
don't don't take it too seriously so
you can see the rest and relax logo up
here on the wall if i turn on our
graffiti layer here you can start to see
it starting to get a little bit occluded
by a lot of this graffiti right we've
also got this wall down here which is
completely disappear so if i toggle on
and off
you can see it's like very much like
almost camouflaged in if i turn around
as well we've got this wall back here
you can see the difference that that
makes and it kind of disguises the the
actual building set that we're using not
that we necessarily want to hide it but
it creates a variance within the
environment enough that
again it means that we don't have to
create completely brand new assets and
it gives us this unique art style that
is different to any other location right
it's also gone in and added just like a
few bits of variants along the floors
and we've got some emissive
logos that the gangs
they like to use emissive paints for all
of their um graffiti and whatnot so
we're going to get a lot more of that
stuff in as well
here it's pretty early so i won't show
too much of that but
so yeah if
basically
if graffiti was our bread then um
this next thing is going to be our
butter and that is
rubbish so
rubbish is super integral on the stage
space stations like i said before like
these they're not well kept at all no
one there's no real administration apart
from i guess you could say the gang the
gang doesn't care they just as long as
like stuff works and they get their
money at the end of the day that's
pretty much it so things just get kicked
to the side
and um just slowly built up over time
right so we're going to get big pout uh
big piles of of rubbish that happen
there's going to be bottles and broken
things everywhere not the most sanitary
place to be in the first row
the thing with with um
with the rubbish and and you'll start
seeing this more as we keep going is
that it's actually quite a difficult
thing to get the balance right so
we actually have to create it's
i say sculpted it sounds arty fatty but
it's it's pretty much for sculpting the
way that we're putting these
uh
rubbish clusters around so we have to
figure out
how it would logically gather up within
the environment and be pushed to the
side or people be
you know easily be able to put it
somewhere so they just put it there
versus here or whatnot right so we're
thinking about that and you can kind of
start to see that here where the pathway
is straight through the middle of this
barrier here it's mostly clear and then
we've got this build up on the side
right same thing here as well it's built
up here and then the main pathway is is
kept relatively clean
so
that's pretty much rubbish now the
rubbish thing
is
a very um
well it raised a lot of alarm bells as
we were doing this right and the reason
being is that
uh it's an insane amount of objects to
start plastering around everywhere right
and um
our entity counts in the game at the
moment are already so high that where
we've we can't add anything more into
the game without taking stuff out right
so we want to avoid that as much as
possible and also it just means that in
general the game runs faster if you're
not if you're loading in less objects uh
as a general rule of thumb right these
are these are what are called draw calls
technically uh
normally and um
we want to address them as much as
possible right so one of the examples of
like these uh rubbish piles just really
not doing us any favors is back here so
i'll turn on my working list so we can
see this again
so we've got a huge pile of rubbish here
right
and
can i interact with you yeah so you can
see that we have like a huge amount of
objects all contributing to this one
pile of trash over here in the corner
and
it really just it doesn't need to be
like this we could do this with just one
object if we wanted to and we could
combine a whole bunch of textures
together and really reduce down that the
cost of the individual asset
individually this doesn't cost anything
like say whatever but you start
multiplying it across an entire space
station you know hundreds of thousands
of these assets
you're not going to have a fun time
right so this is
this is us identifying a problem and
then
as we go into production uh the props
team is actually going to go in and and
create a kit for us where all of these
are one object and it will be
nice
point here a little bit
when he says you can't add things
without taking things away it means that
we've created these
these these levels that have tens of
thousands of objects and stuff like this
and we figured out that's where the
performance is now we have to get
smarter and find new ways of doing it
which is what he's discussing so you
can't just add objects to a game
infinitely any game in existence that
all has a performance cost so we have to
invent new processes and new procedures
to make that efficiently so it's
don't take one little sound bite out of
context and take the whole thing
so continue yeah
absolutely i mean it's it's a thing that
games have done forever right like you
have like multiple objects baked down
into one all the time
so it's nothing out of the ordinary but
uh yeah in our instance here we've not
done
such a substantial amount of rubbish
as we are now so it's something that
we've had to identify right
so cool
right now uh so let's go and explore the
marketplace then
so we'll go downstairs
so
the eagle-eyed among you probably would
have spotted elroy's
elroys has uh seen better days
so
one of the things when we're looking at
these locations is we're asking
ourselves okay how can we sell the
narrative story within within them right
and uh funnily enough
elros was here
and uh i needed more space to put the
market in and um
i can't remember it was me or someone
else in a meeting uh just just joked and
said why don't we just drive a forklift
through it and so that's literally what
i did
i literally just drove a forklift
straight through elroy's and that's
given me so much more room to play stuff
and it's narrative storytelling right
it's like oh someone wanted more room
which is the truth and just drove a
forklift straight through it
so this is like an easy win it's a bit
of fun as an artist to do
uh just to try to sell these things and
it also serves the purpose of giving us
more space within the environment as
well we've also completely gutted our
roys so we've got no furniture in there
anymore
and you'll see what we put in there in a
sec
so um from this point we've got a really
open environment and um
as in the same vein as what we were
talking about with with the rubbish we
need to consider
our view lines and how many objects
we're drawing onto the screen at any
given point
so what we're going to do is we're
actually going to go and kind of
subdivide this space up a little bit
we're going to add in a few walls here
and there blocking volumes
and uh and whatnot and that will enable
us to effectively cull large portions of
the environment uh so that we can keep
the frames up as much as possible right
so this is a very critical thing to
establish early on in the process
so
as you can see a few walls have appeared
and a few blocking elements have
appeared we've got a big wall back here
which is funneling us into a certain
point so you can see that we can you
know basically not draw
entire portions of of the marketplace
here just with these walls same with
this one back here so as we're
approaching if this was to be an
entrance into the marketplace we're
doing the exact same thing we do have a
big
sign of that
line of sight straight through the
middle here
so that would be you know maybe a thing
that we'd bring out and say okay that's
a concerning thing maybe we need to
create another blocking volume or maybe
offset these two volumes from
uh one or these two barriers from one
another right to to solve that these are
the sort of things we're looking at and
then alright itself has gone through a
pretty major change and this is probably
the most developed
of all of them so we've actually gone in
we've really subdivided el rose up heaps
so this is actually going to become more
of a slum so
the mannequins are kind of giving it
away a little bit in here
but
where we've got a room here and then
we've got this alleyway that's running
through here and then back here we've
also got another room as well
so and if i turn on our visory debug
right let's talk about this a bit before
you can see that we're starting to break
up these into different different zones
uh in in the production version of this
environment we actually have this split
up now uh but when we were doing this
for sitcon it hadn't gotten to that
point yet but all of these areas have
their own colors associated with them
which means that they're all in their
own visit areas which means they can all
be culled independently from one another
uh which will just make the game run a
lot faster
in the at the end of the day
cool
so we've gone and done a little bit of
that now we need to start getting in the
actual marker vibe itself so a lot of
stuff is going to happen right now
and uh
basically as i turn on the stalls here
so
the stalls are
basically the whole reason you come to
these markets right is that they sell
every single type of little knick-knack
whether it's good or bad quality the the
food is suitably street food quality
and um
it's just you know it's like the most
lively place
within pyro itself right
so
we've gone in and we've really like
tried to get in that crab street market
vibe as much as possible
one of the the things that we really
needed to be careful about with these
things is that uh while it's
cramped and not a lot of room to go
around and do stuff that there was still
room to go around and do stuff right so
one of the things that was
raised as a concern immediately was that
um the ai needed to be able to navigate
this space right so we have a minimum
space that which uh the ai can like pass
through areas
and we had to make sure that we were
keeping that in mind when developing
these spaces right so one of those was
like this area here
making sure that that is large enough
that two ai minimum can pass one another
and thankfully this this is after a
little bit of adjustment right
but also
discovering uh that the the ai can't
move under
or if if the height if there's a height
restriction as well right it's just
something we didn't think about when we
were making this is that the ai has a
minimum height it makes sense when you
think about it right they're not going
to pathfind under somebody's bed you'd
hope not at least
so
what we actually discovered is that
these stalls themselves
the roofs were so low that they were
occluding the uh the navigation mesh
here so
that meant if we had two stalls facing
each other literally ai couldn't walk
down even though it met the minimum
width
uh requirements it didn't meet the
height requirements so they literally
couldn't walk past
so
we actually had to go in and address
these legacy assets which well i say
legacy they're not really but like
they're from art corps so
um they're a bit older
we had to go in and readdress those to
fix the navigation issues with them and
uh
yeah so that we could use them in this
environment as well if we wanted to but
it also means that as environment
artists we can go in and go okay i need
to make sure that my my roofs are
at a
reasonable height
or any other
kind of thing hanging around the place
because we've got quite a lot of stuff
hanging off the roof speaking of roofs
so because we've got all of this rain
happening within the environment
or just water drops or whatever you want
to call it
they've gone in and actually started
constructing a temporary roof as well
this will aid in them being able to not
only keep dry but
collect the water that comes back down
so
what we what we'll do is we'll go in and
we'll start putting little collection
like buckets or or tubs or whatever
around the place as well and where vfx
come in they'll be able to do a whole
bunch of really cool water effects
around the place as well
so that's really cool but one of the
things that the main reasons other than
that that we've done this roof stuff is
that we really want to get a sense of
parallax with with the actual cavity
itself so
as we look up through the space you can
see that we're getting like a lot of
different levels of depth within it
right if i turn off my working lights
you can start to see that a little bit
better
as well
so you can see all of those different
layers that we're getting within the
environment
that's ultimately what we're after we
want to make you feel cramped but also
understand that you're in quite a large
cavernous space as well
so that's why we
we've gone in and done the roofs
and um
again that suffers from the same issue
with with the rubbish like there's way
too many objects that are making up the
roof at the moment so we're going to
have to go in and just create like
merged versions of those where
five entities go down to just one
basically
so it's a common theme of that
throughout the entire environment
so from here i'm just going to go in and
uh just add a few props so just like
some tables and chairs
we've got a a planter fire happening in
the background
because um
there wasn't any dumpsters i couldn't
find any dumpsters on the original
station dressing so that's a planter
um
and uh yeah so from this point we're
we're missing a little bit of um
lighting within the scene right so at
the moment it's just being entirely lit
by the stalls
uh the stalls have actually progressed a
lot further on from where they were
um
a while back so we actually have a
lighting pass already done on them so
they're they already have lights built
in into them but um
we're still not getting the exact vibe
that we want we don't have any fog we've
got areas like this which is going to
complete darkness which is fine but not
in the middle of a market right if
people are walking around here and this
is a high traffic area you'd expect it
to kind of be lit up
so
like i mentioned before what we did
upstairs we'd be doing this pass as we
were you know figuring everything out
anyways uh but again for the simplicity
i'll just turn it on
so
as i mentioned in in the sitcom talk
we're now getting the thickness that we
need from the lighting and the
atmosphere within within the environment
the fog really helps bring in that like
there's a lot of stuff happening here
people are cooking food there's smoke
from machines going from the fires even
as well
and whatnot it just helps us get a lot
more of the vibe we're after within this
within this environment as well and
you'll also notice that this area here
isn't falling into as much darkness as
before now right
cool all right
and if i travel down here so you can see
our alleyway that we were looking at
before in elroy's is starting to feel a
little bit more
kind of i don't know dark and
moody and a little bit scary i guess in
a way
so we're starting to get a lot more of
that in now as well
so another thing that was super
important and a principle that we had
within the within the environment um
that we wanted to get in was this
uh idea that
this the station's got no power so power
needs to be generated from somewhere
and we we tried to combine this with the
idea that the gang is asking for
protection money so
it's like you would pay your protection
money which would give you power that
sort of vibe if you know what i mean
so
what we have back here is a a generator
room right so this room back here is
going to be filled with a whole bunch of
generators and we've got a little
engineer area here as well uh which is
cool potential for a gameplay if if we
get that in
and um it's just selling that narrative
vibe right
so
with with that whole idea of us having a
generator room uh we need to and and
that is associated with the the stalls
and people having to pay protection
money we need a way of clearly
uh
displaying that throughout the entire
environment right
so what we've gone in and done
is add in
some cables to connect everything
this is a lot
of cables
a lot
a lot
a lot of cables
so
the cables themselves was a a very
interesting
uh thing to kind of figure out within
the environment because
cables are inherently kind of hard to do
when uh you have to place
thousands of them
because there's thousands of them
and uh this space back here in the
actual generator room itself
this alone just to figure out i try a
few designs different layouts see what
worked this alone took me like an entire
day of work just to do in editor just
placing around cables figuring out what
looks good and whatnot right trying it
through a few different designs
and
ultimately
it's it's just a lot of busy work that's
hard to do um not it's not necessarily
hard to do it's just it's not good on
the system and by that i mean it's not
good on the artist when they have to do
a million clicks all the time placing a
million cables
it um we don't want everyone to get uh
an injury right at work from doing that
so
we needed to come up for a solution for
that and also to get the time down
so
we've we've done a number of things
right
uh
which i'll get into in a sec now
in in
when looking at all of these cables
right you can go okay yeah let's
let's place a whole bunch of cables
throughout the entire environment now
there's a number of challenges that come
with that
one is that uh it's
generally
you don't want to be placing one cable
at a time
right because that's this is not going
to happen so what we've gone in and done
is we've actually clustered all these
things together
that means less clicks for the artist to
actually go in and place these things
and uh it also means
less less draw calls so again keeping in
mind the efficiency
and uh
it just makes it a lot easier to place
now in terms of placing um
in in game development generally
cables and stuff have been done through
a spline system right
now unfortunately we don't actually have
one uh in in the engine at the moment uh
so we requested one we we asked like
what's the potential of us actually
being able to get one for these stations
and um unfortunately tech came back and
said we're actually prioritizing on
these other things for that release so
we can't get them in for that one so
based on that right it's sad but uh it
means that we also have to come up with
creative solutions around those issues
in development right
so
one of the ways that we've done that is
by basically just creating the cable kit
some of these cables are already
actually used within the game itself so
we didn't actually have to create too
many more assets but it's just a kit of
assets where instead of placing um a big
spline throughout the entire environment
we would actually be creating a modular
kit so these cables would connect from
uh point to point to one another just
like you would like your your standard
wall kit that we we might be using along
the walls here or the floors or whatnot
it's just with cables so like this
section running down here is like made
up of of two two segments of modular
cable kit right the challenge comes
when uh you try and make it not look
like a modular kit
right and that's what we really need to
work out and and and figure out within
the environment right
and there's a number of ways we can do
that right and this next thing uh we'll
we'll
contribute significantly to that
now
on the subject of also just adding in
like
heaps and heaps of cables we needed to
find a way of
reducing the amount of clicks reducing
the amount of assets we're going and
doing that and and adding those clusters
of of cables definitely helps but we
still weren't getting the level of
density that we were ultimately after
with the cables
so what we actually did is we we went in
and we took
the
uh
the cables that we had made or this
cable trim texture that we had made for
the outposts on pyro and um
created a 3d version of it and then
transfer that 3d version to a flat
texture right
and what we're doing then is that flat
texture of those 3d pipes we're then
just creating like a shell
around the actual 3d pipes within the
environment
to give us give us that extra layer of
thickness so if i zoom in on this you'll
start to see it just completely breaks
down
as as the parallax occlusion mapping
just dies on on these cables here and
this is how we're doing it right we're
adding a significant amount of density
and thickness by just having 2d cables
throughout the entire uh length of
of cable here right so that means that
not each individual one of these isn't a
is an actual cable that we have to place
it's just one big mesh that just
encapsulates the entire uh
like i guess bunch of physical 3d cables
and this really helps not only with like
just reducing poly count within the
scene
draw calls but also stops artists from
going insane which is ultimately a very
important thing as well
so these things are snaking all the way
through the environment they're coming
through here you can see we're mixing
the 2d ones with 3d cables as well this
is that like kind of slum area that
we're talking about before
and ultimately they will go through the
entire environment as well
so this was
this area in particular was another
example of like
figuring out the minimum height for ai
right this is the minimum height that we
can have for a space and have ai
navigator around it and uh as you can
see we actually got two levels
so we get a level on on below and above
this creates a really nice dynamic
within the scene
so yeah
that's cables and a little bit more of
ai so
from here what we're just going to be
doing is is basically adding a little
bit more
of the moving elements within the scene
so we're going to go in and add a little
bit of vfx so this is adding in just
like some heat haze a little bit of
steam and whatnot these effects right
now are just like the placeholder
effects like we were talking about
before with the rain
uh they're just to sell the intent to
the the vfx team and at least have
something in there to show the directors
in reviews
and uh then ultimately when this gets
pushed into production
and the vfx guys come in they'll make
you know actually good looking particle
effects or use existing ones they may
already have that i don't know about
and um make it look spicy so
we've got that in here we've got more
fire happening i think in some places we
have the occasional spark i think down
here yep so we've got some of these
cables shorting out or whatnot it's
it's not very well made that's the idea
right is that these things are so
you look at it you just like i ain't
touching that
that's the vibe we're after
so
we've gone in and we've done a few a
whole bunch of that now the other thing
that we need to look at is um and this
is a concept that we we really
introduced and double downed on uh for
orizon and that is uh the the moving and
dynamic objects uh within the
environment right so
um in
on arizon uh i i personally worked on
the industrial platform providence
platform and on that one we played
around with two animations so we have
the the crane animation which moves
cargo around the platform and we also
have the uh the engine display where it
explodes out and tells you about the
engine and stuff like that right that
sort of stuff is super important to sell
the life of an environment
um
and uh we we learn a lot doing those on
orizon unfortunately for pyro it doesn't
really make a lot of sense to have you
know an engine display exploding or a
crane moving around cargo at least in
this specific setting
so the route that we've actually gone
down uh with introducing a lot more
movement within our seams in that regard
is through uh the the physics within the
scene right so
on ours and we played a lot around with
cloth cloth that was like the first time
that we really got
proper amounts of physicalized cloth
within the game itself and here we're
pretty much achieving we're trying to
achieve the next level of that right
it's just not just the occasional flag
everywhere it's
like how many
how many of these surfaces can we
physicalize in an environment at the
same time right the answer is not all of
them
as you probably would suspect but um
we're trying to figure out how much we
can
um
get away with within the space itself
and on top of that we also have cables
so we're bringing in this is the first
time that we're bringing in physicalized
cables so you'll be able to walk in
um
watch them move around as they get blown
around in the wind and interact with
them as a player as well
now i've not turned it on because
i don't want it to crash while i was
explaining it so i'm going to turn it on
now fingers crossed it doesn't crash
so there we go
so
one of the reasons that we're going in
and doing all of this stuff
in pre-production right
is that we want to figure out
where the limits lie before we start
making guarantees and cash and checks
with directors and stuff like that right
so
when we're looking at like specifically
the physics stuff part of that is the
expense of it how much can we get away
with within the environment itself and
uh also just the general stability of it
within the environment right so
as you can see
in the in this center top screen the
the cable here is is not behaving itself
very well
so this is like an issue that we need to
identify right is is that an issue with
the physics system with the rope itself
is there some sort of instability on the
back end that we need to address
is it something that i've done
wrong right in this instance i'm almost
certain it's something i've done wrong
so
um that's actually a good thing that's
an easy fix i believe it's just clipping
into another object so i just need to
move it
but as soon as i turned on the physics
you may have also noticed
oh it's not done at this time so this is
a thing right one of the cables actually
disconnected and fell through the entire
level
so that that's a bug that we need to
actually address it's like doesn't like
connecting to a certain surface we can't
have physicalized items falling through
the entire world that's just not um
a good thing to have happen right we
want these things to be stable and
reliable
and on top of that as this person comes
through uh
this area here you can see that we have
the cloth interacting correctly with
dynamic objects like characters right so
making sure that that stuff works the
settings we're using on the cloth
entities themselves
and the way that the physics calculation
is handled on the back end is able to
cope with that within the environment
itself
so this is kind of a larger topic uh
especially when when in regards to to
physicalized items right we want to have
as much as this stuff physical as
possible because it brings life to the
environment and it's
generally just kind of fun to mess
around with in games i don't know about
you guys but i'm always messing around
with
any physical item that i find in a game
like i will kick it push it shoot it
so which you can all do with this stuff
right
which is cool so yeah that's um adding
in like a lot more physical elements
within the scene if i go up here as well
we've got another example
of just some more hanging cables so
a fairly static scene
that just
it just
helps
significantly like even though it's such
a small part of the environment just
adding in that little bit of movement
is really good we also have another bit
of a cloth barrier back here that if
if these guys weren't sitting down here
being lazy might give us a demo but
they're not in this instance
so
yeah adding in a lot more of that
dynamic movement it also helps us kind
of sell
specifically in regards to the cloth um
helps us sell a little bit of the
narrative vibe which is that they want
to keep heat in areas right so they're
not just putting this up just so that
people can walk through
like them and just oh yeah that was fun
it's actually serving a narrative
purpose of like keeping heat in this
area and not in that area right it's the
same thing with like you go to a shop
and they'll have like these sorts of
things
like either they'll be to keep our flies
or they'll be to keep heat in or out
either or right
so
that's basically what we've got going
here as well
so yeah
um
so in general like we finished this
pre-production step within our pipeline
now and um we've learned quite a fair
bit in regards to like how we need to
construct these stations so like the
biggest
learning point was basically that we
need to have a very very substantial
uh building set for stuff like rubbish
right and then also for stuff like
cables so actually figuring out how we
can create the density that we need
throughout the entire environment
because even this frame right here even
though there's like a lot of rubbish and
a lot of cables this is nowhere near the
density that we need to actually achieve
what we want so we want to
find all that stuff as early as possible
and we have and right now as we've moved
quite further on beyond this point right
now
we're already starting to implement a
lot of those solutions to the problems
and and already seeing dividends right
so
that's basically the process that we're
going through we've gone in we've we've
figured out where we need to we've found
our performance deficits we've found
creative solutions around them we've
gone in we've actually
relatively well achieved the artistic
vision for the vibe that we want for
these things
as well as
maintaining the
[Music]
game level requirements as well right
like the the gang outposts and um the
ability to go in and have shops where
they're interactable as well as
um
[Music]
just dressing as well
so
that's pretty much where we're at with
with well at least the vt stuff for the
power space stations uh this is like the
most critical step in the process for
figuring out how how to build these
things
and um
this one was i'm so glad we we really
gave this one the time of day because
wow was there a lot of things that we
caught on this one that we really would
have shot us in the foot if we didn't
explore them all properly so
yeah i think i think there's a couple of
things we want to reiterate uh things
that folks who uh maybe
uh weren't here at the beginning uh
might have missed hi
i'm
italian spider-man
especially because if anybody wasn't
here at the beginning he's just like
what the heck's going on um
this is a pre-production thing that we
that we were showing uh this is not
building the asset that you're going to
see in
the game that this is imagine this as
like a giant 3d concept of these things
it's seeing what we can do it's
exploring what the technical limitations
are it's identifying the
problems that building this will
eventually have so that we can find
solutions ahead of time and stuff like
this that's where we talk about the
trash and the entity count and all that
stuff it's to help us discover
the
new tools and processes that we have to
develop in order to make this thing a
reality uh then for uh for the folks in
the chat who who uh
were perhaps talking about oh this is
too much trash and outlaws aren't like
this and they're not messy like this
something uh remember that we are
building an entire galaxy
and this is literally
one location
in one station in one star system and
what not uh these outlaws
are
is the simplest answer to that i'm i'm
sure as the game continues to expand and
evolve you'll see
nice clean tidy outlaws you'll see ocd
outlaws you'll see all manner of things
there's no limit on this kind of stuff
so so for those of you who were in the
chat uh
going a little crazy about all the trash
and stuff like that it's this is just
one
location guys it's it's it's okay maybe
this one isn't for you
but it will be for other people yeah
it's an interesting point to bring up
though like um we've we've also had that
internal debate right where like how
much rubbish is is is correct right and
and generally we also agree that like
the areas that are being controlled by
the gang or like normal people they
shouldn't have as much rubbish but then
areas outside of the market itself like
maybe that's just where people within
the market are just throwing their stuff
the gang doesn't care about that so
you'll see more of an increase there
versus in the actual area itself
but um
it's funny you mentioned that like maybe
there's a tidy gang because uh one of
the things that we we wanted to explore
with with the games themselves is that
they do have different personalities
right and uh we'll go into that more
like probably down the line but um we
definitely do want to do something like
that where we can display different
gang's personalities in in new and
interesting ways for sure yeah
uh we've had scl's with the narrative
team were uh specifically dedicated to
the gangs of pyro and uh even though
they haven't shared all the gangs
they've shared several different gangs
all with different uh ethoses and stuff
so that this is literally just one that
you're seeing so
um all right man um
thank you so much josh i i i i will say
i thought we were dressing up
um i thought we had agreed
to i didn't want to make a point of it
at the beginning
but i mean i i i sat here i can't i came
as italian spider-man
and you came
as
a regular old mummy
yeah disarmament that's disappointing
i'm only the only per i'm also the only
person that showed up to the leads
meeting
dressed
so i was i was clearly
misinformed i appreciate the commitment
all right so yeah folks that was uh
outlaw lifestyles that was uh uh the
expanded uh uh uh artists edition
version of the presentation that we gave
at citizencon
um i owed it to josh it was a it was a
heartbreaking decision to have to cut it
down for uh for for citizencon but when
i did it i promised i'd give him an
opportunity to do the whole thing and i
i think it was well worth seeing because
these things are
amazing uh i i'll love them
so yeah um
that's it for our show isc uh returns uh
next week uh i think it's what november
4th uh
it's we're coming back with a feature on
mining gadgets the latest update to the
mining gameplay and of course
everybody's favorite of sprint report
uh so yeah so that is and then we'll be
right back here next week on scl uh i
think we're currently scheduled for the
ui team uh we'll see if that happens
things always jumble around so that is
josh
right there uh i am uh italian spiderman
and uh uh we'll go ahead and do let's do
the opening video again one more time
let's see before we leave it take care
everybody
