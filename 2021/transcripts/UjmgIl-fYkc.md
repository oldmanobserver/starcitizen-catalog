## Transcript

hello everybody
welcome to another edition of star
citizen live uh the uspu feature team
i'm your host jared huckabee
and joining us on the show this week are
three members of our steam uspu
feature team uh we've got a lot to talk
about today so we're going to jump right
into it some quick introductions because
everybody's
every show is somebody's first show
we're going to start immediately to my
right here
chad who are you what do you do for star
citizen
yeah hi my name is chad mckinney and i'm
a lead gameplay engineer
on the uspu gameplay team and what's a
what's an engineer do yeah program
we make the features in the engine that
you know in coordination with design so
we actually
you know make make the fun stuff is the
way i like to play it
okay ben no stranger to inside star
citizen but
who are you for star citizen live hi
i'm ben dorsey i am a senior systems
designer on uspu
um which means that i do a lot of the
planning and coordination and then some
of the implementation
for a few various things in this case uh
features like reputation and then uh
content like
uh nine tails or jump down too
and classic calling all debs rock star
rob reiniger who are you and what do you
do for star citizen
uh hi my name is rob reininger i have
actually recently been promoted to the
assistant director of the
systemic and play services pillar so
it's uh
classically working with the uspu team
here as product owner of several of the
the features that we've done uh getting
to work more with our
sst team and the mft team here in the
future
uh so be getting getting quite involved
with the simulation here moving forward
and uh once again congratulations on
your sharks themed office
paint job it's it was nice i saw it
the other day it was cool still there
yeah
it's waiting for you when you return to
office all right
so uh on today's show we are talking uh
us features so what does that mean every
team in star citizen works on a finite
number of features
not every team works on every feature in
the game
we also are on the road to digital
citizencon
so there are lots of topics and subjects
being held close to our chest right now
in preparation for
the various panels and presentations
that are coming on october 9th
so we do have a a a a focus of of stuff
that this team is working on that
we're approved to talk about today and
you know saving other stuff
for cis and gone uh we put up a thread
up in spectrum where we collected
questions
throughout the week and let people vote
up on the ones they wanted to see
answered most
uh and one of the biggest topics that
was voted up was
cargo refactor so we're gonna start
we're gonna start with some questions on
the cargo refactor first
um right off the bat why don't we just
set the stage here
what is the cargo refactor and what
isn't the cargo effect
what are we actually trying to do here
what are we talking about when we say
cargo
cargo can be refactored in many ways to
help make the game
play better we've obviously got the
cargo profession that we're working
towards
but specifically the way cargo worked so
in the past here
uh until we finished this
when you bought something from a shop it
got statically placed into your ship's
cargo hold and you could not interact
with it when the ship exploded we kind
of
jettisoned out you know smaller versions
of the boxes that you could actually
grab and
take back to your ship which could then
be sold at a shop somewhere but this
refactor is going to give us a kind of a
clean slate as far as how we define
what our commodities are there was some
some stuff that was just legacy that
caused problems that we wanted to fix
but the big thing for the players is
that it's going to be physicalizing the
cargo within the cargo grid
uh it also sets us up for some other
stuff that we're going to talk about in
a bit you know persistent hangers and
just
the the cargo gameplay as a whole but
from the player's perspective it's
it's the physicalization the cargo you
not tractor beam stuff off the grid
uh you can also track your beam stuff
onto the grid you're also going to be
able to jettison
larger size boxes right so it's not just
going to be the small ones anymore we
can
we can start doing the bigger ones so as
far as what i would expect to see
in the first iteration of it would be
generally that
yeah if i could just add to that one
thing that i would say is i think
everybody's
or hopefully everyone's noticing that
there's all this effort now with loot
and inventory that's been coming out
cargo is being uh refactored you know
just kind of reimagined
in this new world where we have
localized inventory
what that means is that there are going
to be commodities
uh in certain kinds of containers that
have various
compositional contents for the various
commodities that you'll want to trade
but they'll also be things that are
inventory containers as well that can
contain actual items and they can nest
so
inventories containers themselves or
entities so this can mean that you can
be
uh potentially trading and shipping in
your cargo grid
inventory as well as commodities which
means that looting is going to be
available for the continents inside of
the cargo grids as well
and the contents as you move them around
that
the localization of them is going to
become much more important to the future
right now all right so as far as the
diving into some of the questions that
we're seeing from both the live chat and
the spectrum thread here
uh right off the bat uh will we be able
to take other people's cargos or other
people's cargo
uh both forcibly and or with permission
i'm glad they
allowed for both options as well as the
saddle bags on the prospector or the
mall so there's a couple questions in
there so let's do the first one
uh will we will we be able to take cargo
from other people uh
forcibly or with permission that as long
as you can access it
whether it be through you know their
cargo grid getting into their ship
somehow if you can disable the ship
without
blowing it up right and can get in sneak
onto their ship you can
maybe get off with some valuable
packages um so yeah and and
i guess one of the things that we kind
of missed talking about the the refactor
here is that
this the the way that the prospector
bags for instance
were were set up uh was that they were
all kind of part of the ship
right it was just an animated pod but
this will set us up to allow us to
detach those
uh for other people to come and pick
them up taking them to refineries so
that the mining ship can keep going so
it is kind of like a all-inclusive you
know
uh it's just an item like any other item
at this point
right and whether it's attached to the
outside of a ship or
placed inside of a ship it's it's it's
kind of all that
he's kind of cool and so for clarity
when that first started even getting
discussed within the team
within the first five seconds people
were talking about like how cool would
be to run a heist and break into
someone's ship and take their stuff or
force them to give you stuff because
they
you've you've threatened to blow them up
if they don't like that is 100
yeah on the technical side if i could
just like kind of
clarify a little bit previously cargo
instead of cargo grids
were really just some data and
some persistent representation and we're
changing
it to be represented as entities
and for anyone that's not familiar with
like you know game dev terminology and
entity is this really generic term for
just
something that like a player might see
in the game so what that means is that
um
the cargo boxes the um you know those
those prospector whatever bag things uh
these things are going to be things that
we have a lot more
ability to allow to stimulate
independently so that they can attach
detach you can interact with them
individually
uh so that gives us a lot of leeway to
open up new game play opportunities like
actually stealing the sacks and then
putting them onto your ship and putting
them inside
another ship and just getting creative
and other players do very interesting
things uh but yes
just largely a big part of this is just
making them actually interactable
objects in the world
individually as opposed to these like
static fixed things
yeah 100 definitely seems like uh it's
ripe for
uh future progress on things like piracy
and stuff like that because now
these things will be because they're
physicalized in the world now now they
can survive explosions
and stuff like that absolutely yeah and
could be damaged right
so we want to be able to damage a
container that might devalue what's in
it or
you know it opens the door for a lot of
the things that we've said we've wanted
to do with cargo over the last
couple years and then sets us up for you
know being able to put a volatility
system on it or you know it's like yeah
cool it reacts to this other thing just
because it's near it right like
because it's physically yeah degradation
uh but because it's physically an item
we can start to calculate those things
independently of each other
which is really nice and for the folks
in the chat they're asking about when
keep an eye on the public roadmap all
when questions are answered by the
public
as best as we're able to anyway uh let's
see what else do we got in the cargo
factory in regard to the cargo refactor
will there be any lego style or snap to
option
uh or snap two option to get boxes
stacked nice and tidy when manually
placed by hand or a tractor beam or
anything else so that that was one of
the things when we were starting to
to talk about what this refactor means
um
this is a bigger feature that spans more
than just the usp team and then much
like we're working with the actor
feature team on the the personal
inventory and the asset manager
to kind of help go with that um this
is something that we're going to need to
work with them on because that's a
personal player experience
uh thing that you know it's the mining
tool or the tractor beam or the the
paw tool right so um we will provide the
hooks
in order for them to to be able to do
that we said snapping is almost a
mandatory thing that we need right uh so
when they're ready it should should have
all the hooks they need to kind of just
snap it in and uh i think i think the
the first thing i would expect to see
would probably be tractor beam
interaction
on that level and then the the physical
placement um
probably need a little extra work just
from the after movement and
you know animation side of things but
certainly would be able to use the same
data
to do snapping yeah technically we're
implementing it expecting that coming
and it's a planned part the first
release of cargo may not include derived
interaction and
lego style snapping but um the
functionality
under the hood from the cargo system
won't support it
okay uh now folks who have been uh who
who've been paying attention to
social media today have noticed that the
star citizen account announced that 314
is expected to go live later today uh
talking about 314 one of the one of the
new uh um
highlight features of that is our nine
tails lockdown uh dynamic event that
we've talked to in the past uh
ben uh we have a couple questions about
ninetales lockdown
does this event trigger from in-game
actions
or is it like xenothreat where it's
scheduled and
started by the developers uh it is it is
started by developers it's not even
automatically scheduled that's actually
another step that we want to take is
allowing it to be put on basically like
a calendar and put like a date and time
on it
um that was supposed to be the next step
but uh
frankly all that tony has been able to
talk about for a past few weeks is
actually wanting to make it so it's
triggered by things in game potentially
so
that schedule might get a little bit
flipped up um
but it is definitely intended that
eventually some form of in-game
actions will cause these to happen be
that increasing the piracy level in an
area to the point where
ninetales thinks that they have a shot
or even just doing missions for them to
the point where they get enough
resources
as an organization to kind of um
build up the fleet they need to do these
kinds of things and and that's for
all world events in the future that is
the plan that eventually these are all
kind of driven by that
simulation of what's going on and player
actions
yeah and if you want to know even more
about nine tails lockdown check out the
segment we did on inside star citizen uh
towards the end of last quarter
it's available on youtube now one more
nine tails question before we move on
though uh
when ninetales locks down a station or a
landing zone
will players still passively spawn there
uh when joining the pu
or does that affect your login locations
if it is where you were set then you you
stay there yes i do not do anything to
affect you there whatsoever
um that's not to say that we never will
uh particularly if
in some distant future there's a time
when they actually take over that
station that might have some
ramifications
to people there that aren't friendly
with nine tails
but um for now no you will log back in
right on that station so there's an
opportunity for some uh
juicy game starts just log in casually
you know have a fun persistent universe
experience and you're in the middle of a
giant
pvp event has some knock-on fun
potential gameplay of like i need to
hire someone to come in with some big
guns and rescue me and that
sounds awesome in some ways or
terrifying so you know
next week's ise actually is all about
that merging of
pve and pvp uh that we that we shoot for
in the precision universe so check that
out
uh next week okay um chad
one of the subjects that we posted about
on spectrum that's
like garnered a lot of like perk deers
like what what is this
procedural character generation
so let's start with the basics what is
it and what
isn't it yeah what is going on here um
so this is part of uh i would say a much
larger
larger initiative of tony's so if
you've been paying attention you'll see
all these big ideas being thrown about
about like dynamic populations
virtual ai missions all this stuff
and at a certain point uh you have to
ask the question of
how are these things being populated
where does the content come from
and then whenever you start thinking
about that you also start to wonder
about
okay well what about the locations in
the game what about just
the universe that we're trying to build
the number of solar systems we're you
know intending to make
and quickly we run up on a problem which
is that we
really just cannot reasonably hand
author
all of the characters in the game to get
the scale that we're looking for and get
the dynamism that we're looking for
to get the kind of uh i would say kind
of persistence that we're looking for
and the reaction to the character
the players in the game so procedural
character generation
is uh you know one tool to address this
problem and the idea is essentially that
instead of hand authoring you know
the vast majority of the characters of
the game uh
take which takes a lot of time right
there's a lot of very manual
markup that's very bespoke um you know
for example
you know maybe people may not be aware
but like if you just take like a random
engineer in the game right um there
would be like a hundred variants of this
that
hand authored loadouts have been created
for them in order to
add the kind of variety in the game that
you
hope to see uh and even still right
people
notice the repetition right you'll
you'll see the same characters
and the thing is you you want a certain
amount of that you want a certain amount
of seeing the same characters
in similar scenarios um but at a certain
point there's a kind of
uncanny valley where it's like okay that
person was just walking over there and i
always see them over here right
so the idea is that by using a process
that's a kind of seated randomness
that is designer guided with us with
that's rules driven
we can kind of work from
how do i describe it i would say you can
kind of work from
like what the world that we want to
build is
backwards to a set of rules that allow
us to generate
characters to fill out that world in a
way that is
a combination of varied and makes sense
so this is the tricky bit
um for any kind of procedural system
you're going to have challenges where
if you don't have enough kind of
semantics built into the system
you're going to have just incredibly
varied results they're going to be quite
heterogeneous and what it's going to
mean is that it's just going to seem
like
random it's going to seem like there's
no sense to it you get variety but it
doesn't seem like there's
any sensibility that ties it together
once you start constraining that with
any set of rules
then what you end up as a problem is the
opposite you end up with something
quite homogenous you know you go look at
for example um
no man's sky and all the planets where
they're using a procedural
system to generate you know their 18
quintillion planets or something which
is very cool
um but at that certain point you see
enough planets there's a saminess
to it and that's that's going to be true
of any procedural system
so the trick is how do you how do you
balance it to get the
variety that you want but still sculpt
it to have the kind of
um this the kind of
threads that are that are taken through
the characters
and and so what my work is is to build a
system
in collaboration with design and
collaboration with uh
character art narrative all of that to
figure out the world that we're trying
to build and see how we can encode that
into the data
for game play and and environmental
reasons
and then draw upon that in order to
generate characters at runtime
that makes sense in situations and then
the cool part is that these are going to
be persistent characters
so you'll be able to see them again
potentially on the situation
or on the locations so you know
everything from shopkeepers to
security engineers will go through this
process and it's kind of just a
high level ramble all right so that
sounds like what
one two sprints worth of work yeah uh
we're
thinking about that
it's totally not going to be that button
yeah this
this is huge right and and the cool
thing about this though is that it
really
has kind of caused us to all come
together as the different groups within
the company to
to agree and and
you know formulate a a cohesive vision
for exactly how all of these things tied
together because a lot of times what
happens is we go
and we build our thing and and works
really well and looks really good
and sometimes doesn't tie here but this
this is going to be
you know tied to objective values of the
items or
how did how does a military guy know
what he wants to use well he uses
you know things that shoot faster high
magazine capacities and we can start to
build out a list of stuff that makes
sense for those characters
and then diversify them based on you
know how much they care about those
things
um and it's from a character perspective
it's really cool because we were we were
going yeah we want engineers we want
you know tourists and and whatever but
now we can actually start thinking about
like
where did they come from they actually
had a home planet and that home planet
well their their dna
is is mixed generally in these ways so
now you can get people that look
like culturally like they came from some
place um
wearing clothes and styles from those
locations and
they could even behave you know prefer
items of
you know whatever type but that's that's
the the type of thing that we're going
to be able to build as a result of this
and
you know i i don't know how much the the
public knows about how many
character entities we have in the game
but we've literally got like
every 18 civilian one through 187 ben
shaking his head because he knows
like it is it is ridiculous and this
will allow us to go we have
a civilian and the location that he gets
spawned
drives some of these choices the the
core archetype
distinction that some designer set is
the you know another bulk of those
choices
uh what organization may be another
layer of choices right so but it's it's
a
logical you know building up of this
character
that we no longer have to really like
stay on top of so much that
oh why is this guy here somebody just
copy and pasted him like no no this the
the system knows where he needs to go
they know it's cold on the planet so
he's gonna be wearing something that's
warm
right we can start to to build all of
this stuff together as a single
single experience which is why i kind of
threw my hands up in the beginning i was
like yes this is this
is this is the dynamic game and the
beginning of the dynamism that we have
talked about for a very long time
so it's it's super exciting well for
those playing
a star citizen drinking game at home
that was one bespoke
one systemic and uh two dynamics
so uh four shots everybody
all right uh persistent hangers
persistent hangers uh we hear this term
and of course the
the very first module that was ever
released in star citizen's development
was
our personal hanger system so uh there's
a lot of when they when we hear the term
precision hangers
there's a lot of misconceptions that
immediately arise uh going back linking
one to the other so
right off the bat our first question is
what is the difference between
persistent hangers and the personal
hangers
that citizens are familiar with
the idea was at least to my knowledge
was that
these personal hangers were actually
meant to be some place that was in the
game
you know asteroid hangers were supposed
to be on
some place like grimhex or wherever um
the the rebel in york was supposed to be
a microtech hangar right so it's
i i would not necessarily look at them
as different places
but what we're going to provide is is a
place that you can customize you can
leave stuff
and on the floor and when you come back
it'll be there
it is your place kind of like the halves
where you can kind of go and dump stuff
in your hats but
but on a much larger scale these these
will be things that you can buy
they'll be yours you can rent them maybe
things of that nature
right uh it'll allow players to manage
larger scales of cargo
things like that you know storage like
hangers are pretty big right so you can
line some cargo up down one side and
then
spawn a different ship and then put it
on that one
um so it's in a nutshell it's it's
it's taking that personal hanger and
really just kind of transplanting that
into the game and allowing
the game to persist it uh in whatever
state you leave it
yeah i mean if i could just add i would
say that persistent hangers are
kind of a super set of hangers where
they include the personal hangers which
are now persistent
but also we'll include other hangars
that you could potentially interact with
for for other reasons
because we're now going to make them
something that you own that means that
there's going to be some locality type
to them
and they're going to be situations in
the game where you may not have access
to
a hangar that you actually own at a
given location
and they're going to be a set of
processes in place that still allow you
to facilitate certain gameplay loops
um so that might mean maybe renting a
hangar or having a temporary hangar for
a certain transaction
um and it even opens the door you know
potentially for things like
uh hangers associated with characters or
missions and things like that
um so but yeah rob you know exactly
right
effectively what we're doing is you know
i mentioned before that cargo was being
turned into
entities and then that allows us to have
a certain amount of
persistent gameplay associated with them
something's true with the hangers
we're gonna now have the ability to
simulate them as as entities
very similar to ships actually so you
know right now in the game you can
already like drop things in your ship
put ships inside of ships and store and
restore them
et cetera et cetera hangers are going to
start acting a lot more
like that and players are going to
hopefully you know start thinking of
them as something that's like
an important part of their their kind of
fleet their their
their gameplay set right so the the the
player hangers that people are familiar
with the rebel in york and the
and stuff like that uh those are under
the um the greater umbrella of prison
hangers
but when they see the first version of
precision hangers show up on the road
map
and you know eventually make its way
into the game uh it is not
that right away it is working with the
hangars that
are there in game today you know the
area 18 ones and the lowerville ones and
and creating persistent storage yeah so
i imagine uh you're going to choose your
starting location very 18 and then the
ships that you have at area 18
you'll have a hangar there that comes
with your starting
you know location selection right and
that's that's now your hangar
instead of hangar 27 it's you know rob's
hanger
uh rob's medium hanger whatever um and
just like any other have or persistent
location you can go there now the the
only thing that
uh like we're not gonna build like one
hanger entrance for every single player
that's actually on the server right or
or in the game as a whole it's
going to be controlled through atc so
you're going to contact apc say hey i'm
ready to go
and and chad can talk maybe about more
of the the technical
side of this of how we're going to be
bouncing you know players around but
basically we're going to take you we're
going to move you
while you're doing your stuff inside
your hanger and then hey i'm ready to go
atc gives you clearance that opens up a
door
doors open you fly out directly into the
city and
it's all from your persistent hanger
space
yeah so i'll just go a little bit into
detail on that so
the idea is that no matter what for now
we're going to have the locations that
don't have the number of hangers
to support even the current player limit
let alone
whenever we increase that too with
server meshing right so
for that reason we're always going to
have this problem of
too many players mapped to too few
hangers
however we do want to maintain the
kind of player experience of feeling
like you do
own a hanger at a certain location for
even these ones where they're too few
and so for that reason we're actually
going to pin the players to particular
hanger entrances
so that in your experience as a player
you'll go land somewhere you'll you'll
fly away from somewhere it's always from
the same
hangar at that location physically now
there is you know the players may notice
that there's going to be a kind of
you know magical sensibility to it which
because
if we have 100 players in the server or
whatever or even the current 50
then you know the same players will be
using the same hanger entrance and exits
you know how's that possible and the
reason is
because there's magic happening behind
the hood where
we're magically moving these things
around and we're using zones to isolate
them from each other
um so that you don't see the fact that
they're
you know all getting kind of intermixed
but the experience for the players is
that
it's one continuous experience in and
out now
that's for these locations again that
have a more limited
set we absolutely with the system can
expand it to have locations with
larger amounts of hangers which would
then allow us to do things like
individually put down um persistent
hangers for players and
you know that would probably have to
work in accordance with some kind of
procedural system for for placing out
very large numbers of them and we do you
know
you know i know this comes up a lot of
players very aware that we have we have
the real estate right we have
these huge planets like what are we
doing with all this space
certainly that's an opportunity but for
the for the first
out um we're not going to have that you
know unique
one-to-one hanger experience for each
location instead it's
going to be working with the locations
that we have now but the system
will support um as we make it will
support
it in the future if we can work in
accordance with the environment and
level design teams
and planet teams to facilitate the other
part that would be required to have that
kind of experience
it's like with anything else in star
citizen you bring it to the point of
realism then you bring it back to the
point of fun
and it and it's people who if you
physicalized every single hanger for
every single player on the thing
somebody would have to park you know 13
kilometers out from area 18
and have a 15 minute shuttle ride on the
way in just to
sell off their stuff and stuff like that
so we have to find try to find that
mix and match but of course as the game
progresses and expands and stuff like
that
we certainly do have the real estate too
to push
farther and farther towards that realism
so uh like with anything
it'll continue to change and evolve uh
one of the one more question about
precision hangers before we move on to
shopping trading and selling and stuff
uh will we be able to give
player other players access to drop
cargo off in our hangars
i yeah so what we want to build is this
concept of a freight elevator
that is tied to whoever's using it so
when you use it you see your
local inventory stored at area 18 when i
use it i see mine so
now what you get is the ability for you
to bring your cargo out into my hangar
loaded on my ship we can collectively
work together as a group
to then load the ship up with a series
of goods take it to another location and
then
go go and sell it so we thought that was
a really important factor to hit
um you know players want to play as a
group and and
putting the bill for you know 18 million
uec of goods on a ship is
pretty daunting right so it i think it's
a it's a huge
it's a huge win for players just uh not
just for
for working together as a multi-cruise
ship but also contributing together
from a financial point of view of
sharing the cost for
for trading so i think that's a big one
yeah and i think rob's bearing the lead
care a little bit um
if you're if you're paying really close
attention you will have noticed that
there was
quite a dramatic change to the way that
cargo works implied in that ends yes
which is that we're not going to be
magically spawning the cargo into your
ship whenever you
purchase cargo instead it's going to be
purchased into the hangar
and you you'll be calling it from the
spread elevator and then manually moving
it in and out of the
the kind of staging space into the ship
right so this is part of you
i mentioned before that we're trying to
localize the car a little more this is
part of that you know we're getting rid
of the magic no more
no more popping in and out of existence
and said they're physical things
they have to be moved of course you know
in the future this is going to set us up
for systems
such as maybe drones or npcs that would
you
hire to help you move these things um
but for now the idea is that you can
move them yourself using the multi-tool
or you can bring in your friends
and so you know this is one way in which
people that are playing together will
have an advantage over players that are
just playing by themselves because
there's a certain amount of throughput
that you'll be able to achieve with a
larger
crew which will increase your um
financials
as opposed to as a single player so it's
it's kind of bringing that you know
multiplayer interactive diegetic
physical gameplay into the cargo system
you all laughed at the trolleys you said
the trolleys were silly
no i'm just
chad is already talking about an lti
forklift i'll pass it on folks but
who knows it's a big deal though and and
uh actually yeah we'll talk about it
with selling here so
all right so um
we know that there's a there there's a
there's a big refactor to or a big
expansion rather probably more accurate
to personal inventory and stuff coming
and along with that loot generation and
along with that
an increased need to be able to sell and
trade things off
absolutely so um talk to us about what
our
what what our scope of that is i know
it's you know we're not like with most
things we ne
we don't get to do everything we want to
in the first drop
so why don't we just start there what is
next for
selling trading shopping
asset managering yeah so that's the big
one is
uh we're trying to close off some of
these game loops right
we can go out we can buy stuff we can
already sell commodities so that the
next logical step was to be able to sell
personal items or ship items back to
shops
uh just offloading uh you know you
bought 57 different ships but you're
just like you know i just want to
manage you know a smaller set of power
plants or whatever that's that's a
doable thing now
um the the goal is to
start with those item types um generally
kind of limit them to
the types of items that the store will
have for sale right and then
you know go from there the selling ships
back to you know a dealer
uh is going to be a future tier right
but the the important part is you know
when we start going to loot generation
you're going to be able to collect a lot
more stuff
may or may not be valuable but it's it's
another form of
being able to be rewarded within the
game to be able to go and sell it
somewhere so that's a
it closes several you know gameplay
loops that
are either coming online very soon or
you know have been there
for more than a bit and it also gives us
an opportunity to actually uh
change our shopping flow in in the kiosk
it's going to be in the kiosk i should
say
uh we're not going to do it at the
physical item level
uh the the mobi glass level we're going
to try and phase out that mobi glass
uh ui at some point
but the that
in in converting it to building blocks
we can kind of re-envision that flow a
little bit and try and make it a little
more user-friendly
um selling things in stacks buying
things you know in larger volumes
um and these these things will all be uh
if you buy things they're going to get
you know sent to your local inventory if
you sell things you can only sell things
from your
person from your ships that are in that
location from your local storage that's
in that location so
again kind of leaning into that you know
items are localized within the world
concept it's going to fall in line with
all that
um some questions that we got from the
chat and thread here uh want to trade
want to sell want to buy or some of the
more common mechanics in other mmos
uh related to all this are are we going
to allow players to trade between
themselves
like with an old style mmo with or
without
what is the app the mode trader app is
what's called mo trader
yeah uh short answer yes
uh absolutely long answer um
there's a series of confluence pages
with
to be clear the the current mo trader
app is not even tier one it's tier
zero of what we want to implement for
that
um with just plan after plan for how to
expand upon that in in gradated bits
um to include player trading there's
talk even of having it be that there
might be like shipping times on that
that you might
hire a shipping company then players
could be that shipping company
so yes absolutely player trading of
items between each other is
is planned to be supported uh what exact
form that ends up taking
will be determined when we you know
actually start to
pedal to the metal on that that next
step
right as we often stay here even with
a wonderfully talented 700 person team
around the world we can only work on so
many things at any one time and
not everything is in active development
so you can't there are no
updates to give uh and i'm talking to
you bannon merchantman crowd
when it's in development we'll tell you
okay okay
okay
with addition to being able to sell loot
are there plans to be able
to resell a ship purchase with auec
uh it would be nice to be able to get
rid of entries on aesop
for ships that maybe i don't care for
after i have purchased them
sure i i mean that's the plan right is
we want you to be able to sell your
ships
back if you don't basically anything in
the game if you don't want it anymore we
want to give the players a way to
manage their inventory and cull it down
to the things that they care about
um i could even see you know as we we
re-envisioned they stop because the
aesop's gonna need to change a little
bit when we
do some persistent hanger work um i
could see
maybe even just like hey hide this and
you know show you know give your
the ability to hide certain entries but
they're still there right uh
all the way to selling them to to do
another stuff so it's
um you know we want to eventually be
able to take ships to junk sites and you
know scrap them and
you know if you're a pirate right that's
a big question in the games like how do
i steal something sell this big ship
well that's
that's pretty uh it's got to be a pretty
complicated and
you know dangerous thing but that's you
know stuff the cr's talked about in the
past right so it's
uh it's all in an effort to build up
towards you know that level of
ability to buy sell you know legal goods
stolen goods stolen ships
legal ships right it's yeah but
yeah what i'll say is that um rob
mentioned before that it's
it's later it's not going to be the
first iteration of selling and that's
because
ships in the game are much more
important
and for that reason on the back end in
the persistent layer we're doing
a lot more tracking we use a lot more
safety mechanisms regarding ships
if you you know because of a bug or
whatever
lose a weapon or an item or something
like that it's not that big of a deal
but losing a ship is you know the amount
of money that's going into these the
amount of time
that's going into them is dramatic so
for that reason
uh we would have to account for that for
example in ltp
uh and today we don't remove things from
ltp
so that's a that's you know as soon as
you you do something like that you open
yourself up to
a set of you know bugs that you have to
be
very cautious about on the technical
side that you're very confident
when you go out and you're not going to
start just
blasting people's like very persistent
data that they've worked hours and hours
on so
we're being cautious on that part uh and
it's it's not that we don't
you know know how to do it or um you
know don't want to do it
it's more that we want to be careful on
that one
for sure
uh let's see let's move into some more
general term things for the team here
uh will there be more reputation stuff
for people on the wrong side of the law
uh absolutely uh definitely and and
that's not even i'm not even saying that
is like a a
far off super distant thing um i
literally spent yesterday setting up
some data for it
uh when it comes out will be a question
mark
keep your eye on the roadmap as jared is
so fond of saying um
but the there there is
planned support for pretty much any kind
of game play
in the game with reputation the idea is
that what you guys enjoy doing we want
to kind of support with that reward
system
um if that means uh hauling cargo from
place to place there will be reputation
for it if that means
uh shooting people along a trade route
as a pirate there will be reputation for
that both good and bad if that means
stealing big benny's machines and going
and building weird neolithic monuments
on a moon
um for some reason i'm sure narrative
would have a problem with it but
there might be a reputation for that
with some weird organization
so yes uh there will be reputation for
illegal things for non-violent things
for all kinds of things
yeah and uh you know we've talked about
pyro
quite a bit you know this it's a big
thing right then that's more of an
outlaw
system that's going to be you know uh
coming online so it's
definitely going to be more relevant as
we get into that um
but uh yeah as for now we're we're
focused on uh
you know design wise we're building out
the structure behind the scenes
of how this is going to work in the game
and that's actually something we're
going to talk about
uh in a bit more detail with citizencon
yeah
so we're excited to show you some plans
for that uh
adjacent to the cargo refactor we'll get
back to that in a minute
will the cargo refactor include a
meaningful
overhaul of the economy itself
for updated profit and investment ratios
i think it has to
um you know one of the things that we
want to do is sell things kind of by the
box not like this
per unit because it does a lot of
different things when we start to go
down that road where
it takes a certain amount of money to
get into a box a super valuable box
that's this big um whereas you know i
can get into like
the really cheap stuff in larger volumes
maybe they're really expensive stuff i
can only buy in in smaller quantities
but i've got to get
a certain amount of it in order to it's
like buying a lot size on the on the
stock market right you got to buy it in
100 unit lots
uh similar principle uh with what we
want to do for the cargo it
and it kind of ties to you know the
whole sea in these large containers that
that we need to
have to facilitate those um but
it's abs i i don't see how we can't
you know do that like it's it's
mandatory 100
okay uh let's move back to the cargo
refactor a bit
when it comes to loading and unloading
of cargo in space
docking arms for ships and hangars how
do you plan to protect
the players ship from beco from someone
coming on board
during a manual loading process and
flying away
or storing stowing on board stowing away
on board
uh basically how can players protect
themselves
during this vulnerable time i think the
bigger question is how are you going to
protect
your ship and your cargo that's being
loaded and unloaded on your ship
uh who are you going to work with to
make that that a safe thing
to me that's that's where multiplayer
you gamepl you want to hire some friends
eventually we want to have npcs that you
can hire
uh maybe your reputation's high enough
where turrets at the station will
actually help protect you right
um so you know we you're gonna see
reputation being tied into a lot more
things as we move forward
um and certainly you know we've talked
about hiring npcs and
working with other players forever right
so this to me is
is right for that opportunity yeah and
if i could add like i think a lot of
people might hear that answer and feel
maybe a little bit upset um keep in mind
that you're not moving the cargo in and
out on the landing pad
right we're changing it to be in the
hangar right to get into somebody else's
hangar is going to be much more
difficult atc is going to be monitoring
right that are going in and out like you
just end up in somebody else's hangar
bad things could happen uh if you want
to physically walk in there you're going
to have to
sneak in along with them you can't just
decide
via some hanger elevator that you want
to go to somebody else's
you would have to get into the physical
hanger with
them and then get all the way into their
hanger
right so there's just a lot less likely
that this is going to happen
and so for the first outing yeah it's
probably going to be a little bit more
manual process
in collaboration with hec and my guess
is that when we go live
there is going to be a certain amount of
it but it's not going to be like this
rampant
problem and then um even if it does end
up being like that we can always do
things like introduce maybe like a
secret security system and maybe that's
something you have to opt into you know
i don't know see how it goes we'll see
how the gameplay turns out let's see
what the feedback is
um but yeah so it's it's a little bit
safer than i think maybe probably
i mean and and i i i think one thing
that we've kind of
blurred the line between a little bit
here is that you know the the cargo
refactor
is physicalizing cargo it's not going to
change your shopping flow
for that particular feature persistent
hangers
is where cargo gameplay flow is going to
be the
the big thing that changes that so when
it comes to
shops shop still still populated you
know while your ships despawned
uh you know behind the scenes there it
just means that as
a player once it gets spawned on the
landing pad you can walk into the ship
and take it out if you can get in there
it's it's physicalized at that point so
uh the persistent hanger work is what's
really going to drive this entire
gameplay flow of of the the manual
loading and
working with friends and collaborating
on that level and then you will be much
safer behind the
doors of your uh of your hangers so
making things
harder to do is is i kind of mentioned
like stealing ships like that should be
really hard like
it should be really hard to get into
somebody's hangar like maybe you gotta
kind of sneak on their ship and then you
know be a stowaway
all the way back to get inside their
hangar and now
now you you can wreak havoc but it's it
takes an effort
and it's a you know i'm sure players are
going to do it i guarantee it
they're going to find a way but i think
just the physicalization of cargo is
going to be a huge step
we've talked a lot today about the cargo
refactor and how it links up with
the persistent hangers and stuff like
this where do
cargo decks come into this equation you
know we released them
a couple patches ago they famously
looked great but were less filling
as far as the gameplay content uh how do
those work into the
new picture so the there are hangers at
those stations
right cargo decks uh are places where
you make your purchases
uh we we originally um
intended that to be where you can kind
of drive renting space we've actually
since
talked about some additional
possibilities of how we're going to
manage
your overage and and is that a is it
capped
is it just per unit like you pay for the
storage that you
you request for maybe that gets way more
expensive
the more you get closer to certain you
know uh
levels um that you know small stations
may not have a lot of space and
once you get up to like thousand scu
like man that gets really expensive and
it's just not worth it to store that
much stuff there
so um it's i'd see
it maybe morphs a little bit over time
here just as far as the
the original intent um obviously i i
think one of
the big points was that you know they're
not really connected to the outside so
people can't really fly their ships in
and
load it up and go out but that's that's
where
persistent hangers you know even if you
don't own one there you can request a
land one
uh pay for it you know like 500 uec to
go land and then
you go in do your shopping load it on
your ship and then go and then that
hanger
disappears from your your persistence
right so
again it's it's it's realizing that the
gameplay over time
uh that that's this is a huge feature um
we've built so much in the game already
and and we've got to go
go back and make sure that what we're
building still works within the context
of everything that we've got
uh inside i'd expect you know there'd be
things kind of like that that may need
to get tweaked a little bit uh we may be
able to use it right out the gate
um and then uh does this cargo refactor
uh does it include things like the
storal boxes for the
aurora and the mustang at all um
are you talking about the boxes on the
outside yeah yes so the the
because they're items it's like a weapon
is just attaching to the outside of the
ship so
it will absolutely facilitate that
10 000 aurora owners just
cheered in unison now loading that's
going to be interesting
right so you're going to get your track
to be me you know so
that's a different problem but uh
uh let's see how much time we got all
right with persistent hangers
uh will the need to equip ships only
with the inventory you have in the
hangar or at your current location
be implemented at the same time that's
actually going to be coming out with
these this new inventory uh change that
we're doing so
when the asset manager drops the
personal inventory
system is changing right the the pma
will be removed
in lieu of the new personal inner
thought inventory that you probably see
in rich tire and company talk about
quite a bit
uh the vma will also fall in line with
that so the vma will still exist but
it'll be altered to only show
the things that you have at that
location or purchased at that location
so you'll see the equipment from all of
your other ships that you know
obviously everything's like item port
size restricted and stuff like that but
yeah so it'll be localized there
with things like persistent hangers uh
the physicalized inventory asset manager
all this stuff that we're talking about
this coming
how does prison factor into that
and being an escapee because because
that's the question that's it's how does
that factor in it's i guess
in what way like getting back to your
yeah at what point do you get
all of your stuff back because you know
when you when you show up in prison
everything famously disappears sure well
it
i think it i think it works even better
because we've had to actually hack the
the inventory to work around that fact
to hide all of these other things that
was previously in a global inventory
so you just won't have it right like
your stuff
will just not be at that location so of
course you can't access it so when you
get back to
places where you can it'll be there yeah
and i think you know
there's still some fine details to work
exactly on but probably
you know one way that it could work is
uh if you were at a location where you
got captured
um we just store it there if you're
somewhere where there's not really
reasonably anything close that you could
identify as
the location where your stuff is we'd
probably just stuff it in your home
location
um but as i said there's some fine
details exactly
um to sort and then you know the
immediate next question i'm sure that a
lot of people are thinking about like
how do i know where it ended up
right and the answer to that is well
that's why we have the asset manager
app which is to help you understand
where your things are in the world
so yeah the uh we haven't really talked
about we will talk about this in more
detail citizencon but
think of asset manager as the global
view and your
your personal inventory and uh
persistent hangars your ships like these
are all your local
local places so when you want to know
what's on the other side of the system
that'll be
the asset manager or knickknacks uh
who's the actual name of it
again i know we're talking about the
asset manager at susan gunn so we don't
want to go too far into it but
uh will it allow for like text-based
global search of inventories it's
chat yeah so
what it will allow is text-based
filtering of local results
uh at first but not global tax search
and the reason for this is because um
it's actually
much more difficult to implement than
you might just naively think
you have to consider how you're
extracting that data out of the back-end
the way that we're implementing the new
entity graph
system is to optimize it for the kinds
of queries that gameplay does most often
and that usually means hierarchical
queries
and for this reason the way that the
data is laid out in the database is not
conducive to text-based search instead
we would have to have a different
kind of caching layer in order to
facilitate this
which is doable it's it's not that it's
not possible it's just that that's not
the work that's currently being done
we're very focused on server meshing
into the graph persistence streaming all
that stuff
um so the people that we would need to
work with in order to support that are
tied up with some very important things
right now and
uh it won't be in like the global search
won't be out in the first
uh outing but it is something that we've
definitely talked about and
we have some ideas now how to and
on that note um we actually found that
the
we put in an item type subtype so that
the categories and then subcategories
that you would see like in the shop kia
so you got your categories across top
like oh
clothing and then pantries whatever
we're giving that level of filtering
where you can
set up your criteria say yeah filter and
then only the stuff in that location
that matches that that criteria will
show up so it's it's a little more
efficient way to go
where's my guns where's my clothes
where's my uh whatever
um but the the text search because
we're also limited on how many things we
can put or
bring into the query uh results each
time
just because it it'll just take longer
and longer for things to load
so we felt it was better to give you
faster results than to
create this huge list wait for it to
load you know for 15 minutes right and
then
allow you to interact with it um so
we've actually i think we've actually
turned the the text-based filtering off
right now because the the
type subtype or the category stuff was
so much more efficient we're like
let's just let's mix that and give them
a little more space to to show items
so it's not a question it's just not no
no it it was one of the first things i
wanted i'm like i want to i want to type
you know much like we have in the
defense list in the front end
right where you can start typing
somebody's name and and see them
you know pop up in the list like that's
exactly what i want as a player and i
want to i want to be able to type
keywords i want to be able to type
you know like sniper or you know bullet
or
whatever that that's is a game that
manages
so much stuff we have to have those
quick and easy ways to
not just figure out where what it is but
where it is and
what i need to do to go and get how much
of it i got right what quality what
shape is it in you know
there's a there's a bunch of stuff that
will be coming into play much more as we
move forward
you can send your hate mail to me i had
to i had to break the bad news
throughout the years
it chanted he wasn't calling you naive
he was just calling director gunner it
was that was directed specifically to
director
yeah everybody else is fine he just
meant director gunner
um i don't know why i'm picking on
director gunner
will reputation affect selling price or
taxes on trading or selling loot at some
point in the future
absolutely uh absolutely absolutely
uh that is one of the core so there's a
there's a portion of reputation
uh that is like one of our very public
very core plans of it is perks
um you've got a very small amount of
that that you saw with the bounty hunter
reputations where
you get a little bit more mission
rewards as you rank up with a certain
organizations
this would fold under the the expansion
of that into
much more varieties and much more
interesting perks
that's actually one of the simpler ones
frankly uh
the it might be a specific shop if it's
like a little mom and pop store that
you've got a really good reputation with
that specific person or it might be
company-wide if there's like
uh garrity defense then you can you know
get all of those various stores
um but yes absolutely when you're
selling uh
and and taxes and all of that could be
affected by reputation
um in certain areas yeah buying and
selling we talked about
hiding things behind reputation you know
so you got to be
x reputation you got to be a private
with us in order to
to buy our weapons um we also wanted to
you know it ties into subscriber flare
as well
right like we've always talked about
wanting to put a subscriber shop in
there so guess what
subscribers just a reputation that is a
bullying on or off you know
um and that is kind of like one of the
core
when when we say like oh this thing will
give you x item it generally will more
give you access to x items
and that's why when you fall below that
rank we aren't going to take that out of
your inventory because that's just
rude frankly um it's that that item
might decay to a point where
uh it is broken or needs to be repaired
or something you won't be able to get
back until you're
back in working order until you are
above certain reputations or get a
replacement until you're above that
yeah so and as we move forward uh with
the game obviously wear and tear is
going to become
much much bigger of an influence over
over your gameplay like right now we do
a lot of things with ships where
we basically just give you all brand new
you know stuff when you
claim insurance but eventually the
intent is that
like your parts are wearing out so if
you lose your rep to be able to buy
you know have access to it you may not
have to
you may not be able to get it repaired
by them or
uh you may not be able to get another
one so it's yeah it's it's
i i can't express how fundamental
reputation is to our progression system
uh enough
it is it is huge and it's going to be
tied into
as many things that make sense but it's
going to be in most of the stuff that we
work on
it's going to be a factor and as a
follow-up to that subscriber for your
thing uh we're talking about
many subscriber players get lost
throughout the course of
you know adventuring in the prison
universe we're talking about an easy
place for people to go back
and reclaim the things that they have
already yeah i mean that's
that's an interesting you know point you
know they
typically you know with the the players
are just doing like character resets and
then getting their stuff back right
um reclaiming it like we have talked
about you know
if you lost it maybe at some point
somebody could find it
right and then it gets returned to your
home location where you can go and pick
it up
there is talks about how we can do that
for some of those key items like the
subscriber things or like the the things
that you you know paid real money for or
um the the special stuff right you know
that
your your special mount or et cetera
uh so to speak but yeah that's that's a
it's it's it's in the plan i i don't
know when that's
scheduled or it's an evolution of the
shopkins
shopping experience for sure and i know
next year is going to be much more
economy focused as we kind of get the
quantum
tooling integrated into the game more
and more so
that's that's what i would like to see
that happen but
it's all gonna come down to priorities
yeah
i also should clarify for zen a threat
we are going to
directly reward you some stuff at
certain reputations after the event is
done
um but that is something that we do not
plan to do long term
that's a yeah so that's that's a good
point like
