## Transcript

hello everybody welcome to another
episode of calling all devs our q a
series where we take questions from you
the star citizen background put them
directly to our developers usually over
teleconferencing
we were doing it long before the world
was you know way to catch up
world joining us on the show this week
we are talk we are talking to dan
treffin
and johnny josephius about refuel
and repair so to get us started we're
going to go ahead and put a call in to
dan truffin from our frankfurt studio
dan
how you doing man hey jared all good
here how are you
uh yeah getting by getting by um
we are talking refuel and repair uh this
episode
uh so my understanding is that you are
you and your team
are in the early days in the early
trenches of
actually finalizing the design for for
refueling that we'll be
pursuing for the persistent universe so
wanted to
see if we can pick your brain see where
we're at see what the current
implementation is because we've heard a
lot of things over the years um
what do you got for us so yeah
you're right we're in the early early
stages of this
um we have a general high level idea
and at this point one of our senior
designers is
heavy at work on pretty much ironing out
every little detail that's gonna come
come into play for uh for refueling from
how does the ui look how does the flow
of the ui
how where is the ui positioned in the
ship where how exactly does the
starfarer
boom arm function for refueling stop is
so i'll i'll try to take you through a
bit how this works
um players will be able to go
to a station and using the refuel rearm
stock
ui that will need to get redone for this
because
it was very simplistic as they only
doing little things
they'll be able to fill up their
starfarer with uh
either hydrogen fuel or quantum fuel
they'll be able to
also equip their starfarer with various
uh tanks
that are made purpose they're purposely
made for quantum fuel or
hydrogen uh fuel and then they'll have a
ui to select how much they want in tank
five how much they want in tank three
which type of fuel stuff like this
uh once that part gets done they uh
they'll pretty much have to fly and uh
find find a guy in need find a guy that
has run out of fuel didn't check his
fuel meter and
made the made a bit of a mistake um
we're foreseeing this would be much more
of a problem once pyro kicks in
because refueling opportunities there at
the station are
really minimal so this will come into
play a lot more
so for tier zero we're kind of looking
right now at the players using chat
google chat and going like dude i run
out of fuel is anyone with a starfarer
here that can help me or
hey i have a lot of fuel anyone needs it
and you guys meet the
former group he means that that the
old-fashioned way
in the future we're thinking of uh using
the beacon system to actually create the
beacon hey guys i mean fuel
uh we could do this at the beginning but
it will just take us longer to release
and it could be a separate
part that comes in later so we thought
we'd rather get fuel out to the
to the players refueling out to the
players as far as fast as possible
and then we're we're gonna do the part
where you actually have a
have a way to contract fuel being
brought to you or
i'm selling i need buyers basically
so once you reach that person we're
gonna leverage the
the existing docking stuff that's coming
online now
uh to uh you'll be using the same ui
to dock basically your starfarers boom
fuel arm with the the ship that's out of
fuel
the ship that's out of fuel obviously
has a fuel intake port
that you'll have to pretty much it's a
spinning the
the tail on the donkey type of thing
it's a very precise maneuvering thing if
you mess it up you either break your
boom arm
or you break the guy's ship so there'll
be a lot of challenge in doing that
docking
basically you're flying tons and tons of
metal and fuel
into trying to very precisely
uh insert that nozzle in there uh once
you manage to do this and if the ships
are pretty much connected similar to how
the docking operation works
you will have a fuel transfer ui where
you'll be able to
uh set a price which type of fuel which
type of tank do you want to transfer
uh from the the uh the receiving guy
will be able to say well i only want
half a tank because i'm long cash or
something like this there's a pretty
much a trade interface where you have a
bit of management of
what you want how much do you want and
from the starfarer side
where do you want to deliver from
because you might have a tank that's
completely full
time that's completely empty we're
looking into
gameplay here of how the pressure in
those tanks
actually speeds up the the delivery of
fuel so there will be
we want to insert a bit of gameplay here
where you can
if you know what you're doing you're
going to be doing this fast and you
might be in a few seconds like a like a
pit stop formula one thing
and if you're just an average player who
first has a starfarer and doesn't want
to be bothered you will still do it in
about 30 seconds or one minute depending
what you're refueling might be a few
minutes if you're refueling
i don't know nitrous uh that might take
a few starfares but you'll still be able
to do it but you'll just do it slower
at this point both of you guys are
sitting in space so if someone finds you
you're you're in a lot of trouble uh if
they're a pirate
so there's uh there's a we always want
to do the swiss reward thing in our
gameplay we just don't want to
get you guys to go there you push a
button and then you wait for everything
to refuel
that being said refueling will take time
refueling at the station is going to
take a lot longer than it does right now
refueling between two ships it's going
to take time it's not just going to be
you push the button and you fly up
no it just takes time so
only an operator that's the the big
picture of how how this works and
uh hopefully we'll get to release it
soon
tm uh let's see it's still early it's
still early but
we're we're getting but it is still now
i want to clear that that statement up
it is still early
we have been talking about refuel and
repair and many of these systems
throughout star citizen development
for several years now uh when we say
it's early days in spain that means
active development on this feature is
now begun
the schedule the scheduling is done for
it we
we are just ironing out the details in
the design we already talked with
a lot of the dependency teams all the
guys that need to provide the art
the change the boom arm for refueling
uh how would we do the fuel ports
there's already people there's
there's gears are emotions motion for
this this pretty much needs to
come with pyro because if it doesn't
then a lot of people are gonna get
stranded in viral and there's gonna be
no solution for them
so uh yeah it needs to get there well
that answers my one question
that without me having to ask it so
thank you
um all right and i get i gotta imagine
uh you and your team have done so much
work on
mining at this point i have to imagine
there have been some lessons
learned working on mining that you're
going that you're applying to refueling
can you can you can you speak to any of
that right now
um i think the it's
maybe not the lessons but there's also
lessons uh but
mainly uh i kind of like it how the team
started doing a lot more than just uh
uh programming or designing that we
started to having our guys know how to
build uis from scratch and uh that helps
us for example now with the refueling ui
we just can build our own uh ui art is
just gonna come at the end and make it
pretty but we can build it completely
functional
get all the gameplay done without having
to depend on external teams and kind of
waiting for them to finish
all of these external teams have like a
backlog of tasks till
the next year at least and if you have
to wait for them to slow so
we kind of streamlined and we learned a
few tricks that we didn't know before so
now we are we're a lot faster in
iterating we did the mining ui we did
the refining ui
uh so now we're we're pretty much where
uh we can just get the ball rolling as
soon as we
we have anything with ui that needs to
get done
other than that um staff from mining
that
will apply here lessons we've learned um
we'll have to see how we deal with
economy mining has had a lot of ups and
downs with economy and
we'll have to see how we do this without
getting the players in a status where
basically refueling this patch
is is profitable next patch is not so
profitable
and they get they stop playing the
refueling type gameplay just because
it's not a profit
thing so this is something that's
probably going to be a bigger bigger
thing that we have to do throughout the
game that economy needs to go every
quarter we release and it needs to be
good for all of the
all the types of gameplay not just the
new one we released
but yeah it's a work in progress we're
still learning here
all right uh last question again about
the relationship between mining and this
mining famously can be done
poorly uh to catastrophic
results humorous but catastrophic
results
uh are we thinking anything along those
lines for refueling is there
is there going to be a way to mess up
refueling so bad
there's two ways you can mess up
refueling first of all if your pilot
is crap he will collide with the ship
he's trying to refueling he will
hit it with the up the the arm he
there's so many things that can go here
he'll either damage the arm or damage
the ship or damage the starfarer
um the other part where you can go wrong
if you're trying to do it faster
as they speed up the process of once the
ships are connected
and you don't know what you're doing you
either that that nozzle can
either burst it can eject fuel into
space it can ignite it can cause a lot
of problems
we're also looking now as a higher tier
of
how to store more fuel
so you might actually want to
um you might not want to fill up your
tanks all the way to the max
and high pressure especially if you're
going into hot areas
unless you have a tank that is made for
those high temperatures so there will be
certain conditions in which
if you have a highly pressurized tank
yeah you will refuel faster but
if you enter a hot zone that fuel is
going to
start to it's if the pressure starts
increase increasing that fuel becomes
unstable you might
you might blow your ship up so we're
looking in in this direction too but
probably not for the first release first
we want to do the basic stuff and then
same as with mining we keep building and
building them so that being said
with mining mining and refueling while
not
directly connecting connected the idea
was always that you mine
you refine and then you can use whatever
you find to refuel
so that is kind of the entire chain but
that will be coming also
a bit later so so so custom tanks
multiple fuel types uh uh variable
pressure
uh so that so there's an actual uh game
plan skill element to it
and i'm gonna guess
knowing mike snowden that have fully
fueled up
uh starfarer uh will make a big big boom
oh yeah oh yeah i'm looking forward to
the video
it'll be the fuller it is the big the
bigger the bang and it's also the fuller
it is the harder to be to do anything
with it uh
uh chris was very adamant on this thing
where like if you fill your ship up with
a lot of fuel
it will move like a slow boat and you
know
in mud basically so there will be
choices to be made there do i fill it up
all the way or do i just feel one tank
for each tank here ten percent
or something like this very cool all
right dan i think we got it
thank you so much we're going to throw
it over to johnny jesebious now and and
see where we're at with repair so i can
let you go take care
bye bye all right thank you so much dan
uh moving on to the second half of our
show we are calling lead
fps systems designer mr johnny josephius
man with the coolest name in all of cig
johnny how you doing man
hey i'm not bad how are you i'm all
right uh
i couldn't get my hair to match because
i recorded the first half one day and i
recorded the second half another day so
i'm just wearing a hat so
people nobody will notice nobody will
notice nobody will notice
that these aren't all recorded on the
exact same day at the exact same time
all right johnny we are talking about
repair we
just got done talking to dan uh dan and
his team
uh they've they finished the majority of
their technical design
they've they've got sign off from cr and
they're beginning their work in earnest
to get repair refueling going uh in line
with the release of pyro hopefully
fingers crossed no promises that's just
our target
you and your team are working on repair
as a counterpoint to salvage it's not
quite where dan's
team is it's a little early earlier in
the process so want to talk uh why don't
you
go ahead and tell us where it is where
we're going what considerations you guys
are currently investigating
uh right now and just uh just give us
what you got about repair
nothing so yeah like you say we're in
earlier stages at the moment we're
still firming up on the design so you
know everything i say here
might not make it to you know when it
actually arrives in the pu
um but yeah essentially salvage and
repair
it's the kind of like the first version
of salvage that we're actually doing so
what we're calling it internally is it's
more like
hole stripping so you're actually going
up to ship some vehicles and you're
either stripping away parts of the hole
which lowers its health it's like its
integrity essentially uh
visually as well because it uses the v2
damage map or that's what we're
intending to do
um basically burns it away takes that
material away and
stores it in the canister even if that's
on the you know the multi-tool has a
material canister and the
larger salvage dedicated salvage tool
that we're going to be doing
has an even bigger one so you can store
even more of that stuff
and basically yeah you can either strip
away from the hull or you can use that
material or you can buy full canisters
of material to come
and use that as a repair resource as
well so if your ship takes a few hits in
combat
you'll be able to pop out cockpit eva
over to it get your
repair tool out and kind of fill it in
if you come across the idea is at least
if you come across something like a
derelict and your ship's damaged and you
don't have any repair resource you could
strip away some of that ship
and spray it onto yours um so it's not
going to be
100 like oh i've just you know
sprayed this magical you know metal
substance into the ship again and it
looks like it's brand new
it's going to look a little bit more
battle scarred and the idea is we want
to use a different material on that to
show
like look you've patched this up
yourself it doesn't look
like a pristine ship anymore if you want
it to get back to its pristine state and
you know 100 health again
then you can have to take it back to a
shop to get someone to properly repair
it for you
interesting so a little bit to unpack
there
so repair is intrinsically tied with
salvage
it is basically salvages one mode and
then you flip the
darn thing into reverse and you're in
repair in the other mode
but you said something interesting that
when you when you
repair your ship when you run your your
salvage beam either from the multi-tool
or from the dedicated tool
and we showed some of the dedicated
tools recently on isc you were there
um when you run it when you run it past
it doesn't restore
your your paint job and everything it's
going to be some
like third transient state because we
got our pristine ship
with its paint and tack and then we've
got the damaged ship
you know you know as it degrades wears
and tears whatever whatever happens to
the ship it takes it
to the stress point up to when it's
about to explode
but then salvage can bring it back or
not salvage repair can bring it back
not just to where it was originally but
to some
other third state where it's kind of
like unpainted metal or so
that's part of what we're exploring
right now yeah yeah so there's a lot of
technical
considerations that i don't want to
write checks for at the moment because
we have to do some we have to talk with
the graphics team we have to start with
a bunch of different people to make sure
that that system will work but that is
what we want to do from design side if
we can
because it does give you that nice
visual feedback of like you know i've
been through a few battles i've had a
few scrapes and i've patched up myself
because i want to keep going while i'm
out i don't want to go back to a landing
zone or anything to get fixed up
so um yeah it does give you those like
it
feels cool right like you've been flying
around for a while like i've taken a few
hits but i've scraped through and i'm
patching up myself
it looks uh i think it'll make a few
ships look you know battle scarred and
awesome and it also kind of ties into
the fact that
you might not necessarily be able to
restore that part back to its full
health again unless you go and either
get a replacement for it or you go and
get the proper repairs for it as well so
it gives you visual feedback on both
sides like i've been out and about and
had some scrapes and also this is a
little bit weaker than it was to start
with
so what makes now the time
to to get into this because because
we've talked about
repair i mean since the beginning of the
of the project
um and and we we carry a lot of ideas
forth with us throughout the years
you can go back through wingmen's
hangars and old atvs and see
many of chris's comments on it
throughout the years but what makes now
the time to actually buckle down
and start you know you know putting
things on paper
and start actually pushing the process
forward
well to be honest it's been a long time
coming and it's a system that's
basically
been needed and the more persistence
that we get inside the pu and the more
we want you to be kind of
well we've got the health system coming
in for starters soon which obviously
makes you care about everything you've
got and taking care of all of your items
you know a lot more important uh because
it's all persistent so
um if you do get into a few scrapes in
the p you're not gonna just wanna
you know abandon your ship and you know
die on a planet somewhere
you're going to want to have an option
to be able to repair it and you know fly
out of there
so um i think it all just ties into all
the other systems that come into the
game at the moment and the fact that
it's a system that's been looming for a
long time and this is the starting point
for it obviously
it expands out when we start looking at
ship salvage there'll be similar systems
there where you might be able to use you
know whole scraping lasers to take that
stuff off but then there's things like
the reclaimer with the claw
and you just kind of progress from what
we're doing down here all the way up to
that
so yeah this is a really good starting
point you know for us to start
you know noodling around with playing
with seeing what works what doesn't
and then you know go from there
basically i have to imagine you're also
in a similar situation to
refueling in that the pyro system is
coming and there are
fewer rest stops fewer repair stations
along the way
and uh you need you're gonna need more
options to to
uh maintain your own ship because you're
not gonna have an
easy stop-off point to to instigate
repairs like like you like it like you
have in the uh
the stand system yeah absolutely it's a
lot more remote and barren isn't it and
you know you're gonna want to be able to
be a bit more self-sufficient
than you can be at the moment so uh yeah
and i think it even ties into a few
things that we want to do down the line
too so we've not even mentioned where we
want to take this beyond the whole
stripping is that eventually we want to
be able to when we get the physicalized
ship
items inside the ships too we want this
to be able to time with that as well so
if someone does target your power plant
or whatever and take it out and you end
up just about managing to land your ship
somewhere
you want to be able to repair that power
plant back up rather than you know being
completely stranded because you've got
no power plant left so
eventually that's to come later that's
probably not going to be an artesia
release but
later down the line that's certainly
something we want to do too and it does
tie into that whole
self-sufficiency thing so so where so
where so where do you go from here uh
it's i obviously don't give us like
don't put like a date yeah we're gonna
have repair on
december whatever but but but what's the
what's the process like from here
uh from here forward so where we're in
terms of
uh from a design point of view yeah like
like in the overall pipeline and
if you imagine the overall getting
repair into the game pipeline where are
we at in this pipeline
what's what's still left to do um so
we're still early we've got the design
stubbed out on paper which we've been
going through with um
game directors like rich rich tyra um so
we've been working on that with him uh
we've been trying to come up with a
what we call a functional design as well
which is essentially a fancy name for
basically working out the numbers in
excel for a first you know bounce pass
on
you know the you know the stripping
rates and stuff and how it degrades the
health on chips and everything so we're
just working all the details out at the
moment
and there are other teams that we're
obviously very dependent on to get this
working so we've been talking to the
graphics team
network teams obviously if i've like
drilled a hole in my ship with my
salvage tool
we want that shown over the network and
that comes with its own problems
uh so there are a lot of things to
factor in and then it also comes down to
things like the
we've been in contact with the vfx team
uh at some point we're gonna need to see
what the salvage beam actually looks
like
in situ with what it looks like when
we're burning away the ev2's on the ship
too
so it is very early stages
investigation like tech investigation
being done by several teams that link
into this and then also
very similarly to what we do with a lot
of our design workers we're in
kind of working with the teams that you
know work on the concept of the visuals
to see what this looks like whether it
be ui
or vfx or anything like that so
well i imagine we'll be following along
with it as it develops just as we will
with refuel and just as we
have are currently with like the
colonialism outposts and everything
uh be sure to stay tuned to inside star
citizen to see this feature as it
progresses
throughout the remainder of this year
johnny that's it
thank you so much i can let you go no
it's been fun
all right take care bye that's it
paid the bills i'm jared huckabee we'll
see you all next time everybody take
care
you
