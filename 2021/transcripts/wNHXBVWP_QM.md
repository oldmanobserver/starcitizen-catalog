john turned around to me and told me
that we were going to be putting the
bengal
into the actual pu and at first i
thought he was just pulling my leg
because me
it's the bengal the bengal the biggest
ship that we're ever going to have in
the pu floating around
and i was like well it was just gonna
appear then fly away or is it just a
poster and he's like no no no
i i wanted to be like we had the javelin
last year where it comes in
it shoots the players can try and fight
it and it flies around i'm like
cool that that's not a small amount of
work that's a
little bit of a minor task on top of
everything else that's going on
the bengal itself had a lot of old
issues with it
compared to a lot of our newest ships it
didn't feel as good it didn't look as
good
so we saw this as a great opportunity to
go in and just
fix some of this old legacy things that
we've done with the actual sips up
so we started by fixing the problems
first of all so the the giant engines at
the back
the whole thing was a single thruster so
we started by cutting that out making
the actual nacelle part of the main ship
geo and then
after making the ship geo we then
attached the actual thrusters as
thrusters so they work as thrusters
and then we found that it didn't have
proper thruster placement because it was
using the original ifcs system that
didn't need it completely in ifcs2
obviously
it's not fake that it's real so we had
to actually go in and place new
thrusters and reel in some of the old
ones just to get it
to feel nice and fly the way we'd expect
it to
and after that we had to then look at
the weapons that
this is the bengal it's got over 90
turrets to it that function the fire
that fight back that
you have to actually deal with so
we went through and we saw that a lot of
them were very nose-heavy placement so
we then completely changed the design of
the location of the
turrets which went through a couple of
iterations to make sure everyone's happy
with it
it felt really weird for the entire
carrier to have a complete front nose
battery
so we moved a lot of the weaponry and a
lot of the cover around so it was evenly
distributed around the ship for the
missile turrets the balancers
after that was all done you know those
really small minor insignificant tasks
it was then a case of
actually having it work because
unsurprisingly when you put the bengal
into the
the pu it doesn't run very well because
there's a lot of entities it
it was a huge performance hit like it
was insane even
internally we were seeing a massive
performance drop
so the next job was to try and optimize
this to actually
get it to run in a decent way
if you have a look at any of the ai
ships that the the pirates use in the pu
there's physically a dude sat in the sea
which at the end of the day
costs everything has a cost involved so
we started to explore a couple of
different ways to do it one route we
took was to hide the whole thing behind
this area so it just
wouldn't render it wouldn't call it
wouldn't draw any of it and
that that gave us a lot of wins but we
also saw this opportunity to try and do
something we haven't
really done on ships before which was to
have actual
ai modules controlling the turrets so
we start playing about with them we hit
issues because we've never tried to
implement it on this sort of scale
but after a lot of people doing a lot of
hard work and playing about with that
and making slight tweaks here and there
we ended up with the the ai turret
module which
was a huge huge performance boost and
i spawned in a load of um pirate
addresses to bite the thing
and it was just amazing watching all of
the guns pointing different directions
and just
fire everywhere it looked amazing and
then the missiles were coming in it was
shooting down all the missiles
everywhere
and that's probably spent a good half an
hour just trying to actually hit it with
a missile
there's just that much gunfire that it
just
it looks great it's hard to describe how
cool it looks when it's actually firing
a
a group of people the impact of seeing
the bengal working flying around was
just
incredible for people and the bengals
something i've been working on for quite
a long time
for squadron 42 but once it's in the pu
people can fly around it and just
take in the sheer size of it it's just
incredibly huge
and having an event like invictus meant
that we push
specific tech and specific things in a
way that
we're going to be used later down the
line so that's
a step forward towards having unmanned
ai turrets on ships we learn better ways
to optimize the way we actually have
ai crew inside the ship because
everything we do
can be reused we learn from it we
improve from it and it can help
everything it's all
it's a lot of work and we we as
developers spend a lot of time
focusing on really minor details and
sometimes we
we just tunnel on little things and
think well is this
is this you time i'm spending on this
one little thing really worth it
but then when we see it in the community
and see how much people love it and how
wild they go for it
just seeing their responses to it it
just completely lifts my spirits up
every time so worth it in the end once
we actually got it in
really really cool invictus has quickly
become one of the major highlights of
our year
as well as a fine addition to the star
citizen experience overall
and the bengal was just one part of
everything that goes into making the
event so special
each and every year now from looking
back
let's look ahead it's sprint report time
so let's get to it
starting things off members of the ui
team have completed a sprint porting
many of the transit signs found
throughout the persistent universe
to use a newer and more robust version
of our building blocks tech
now as with everything that makes this
transition it not only allows for
easier swapping of various styles and
themes without having to change the
underlying information
but it's also far more efficient and
less resource intensive
leading to performance gains all over
when every little bit helps
this is a small sampling but the team is
looking forward to adding more
and varied styles to the various
interactions players encounter
throughout the verse meanwhile the
character team is close to completing
work on the grey cat armor that was
revealed alongside the grey cat rock ds
earlier this year
now while it's designed to specifically
support mining operations
fashion forward citizens will still find
a lot to like here
[Music]
whoever said support roles couldn't look
badass obviously
never worked for our character team
[Music]
props teams have recently begun their
explorations
developing the various chips and ports
necessary
to support the upcoming hacking gameplay
currently scheduled for alpha 315.
now while there will be a variety of
high and low tech offerings
these were the the conversation starters
if you will
to help us determine which direction
visually we wanted to go in
they even created a handy animatic to
see how the pieces all fit together
along with a sneak peek at the hacking
visual interface
that we're going to see a lot more of in
isc next quarter
now recently you've seen the current
exterior progress of the aegis redeemer
during invictus
so let's take a look inside the
continuing work on the interior with a
look at grey box progress on the manned
turret
remote turret bay
and habitation module
[Music]
vehicle teams have also begun looking at
the constellation
dash controls as they prepare to convert
it to utilize the updated
interactive cockpit experience now
before you jump into the comments
the physical buttons you see here are
just temporary placeholders
as the intention is still very much for
this rsi stall work
to maintain its touch screen holographic
interface
whenever possible in addition to that
the aries starfighter
currently on the public roadmap
scheduled for an alpha 315 release
is making its way through the white box
phase of our ship pipeline
after recent work on the mercury star
runner and the hercules star lifter
i've no doubt this will become another
fantastic addition to the crusader
lineup
when it arrives towards the end of this
year and since we're on crusader let's
take a look at these final art images of
the crusader shuttle that will
whip zoom players around from platform
to platform when it arrives in the
upcoming alpha 314
and before you ask no you cannot has one
well maybe if you asked john crew really
really nicely that could change one day
now i'm absolutely not empowered to say
this
but you should ask them anyway because i
really won't
[Music]
moving along last time we took our first
look at orizon by night
so let's continue that journey with
these images from the lighting team
as they continue their work creating an
atmosphere that's truly unique
from its daytime companion i'll just let
these images speak for themselves
[Music]
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that invictus is more than just
a chance for players to experience our
capital ships
up close and personal it's also an
opportunity for our developers to
push needed technologies to the
forefront in ways that will benefit the
entire
persistent universe going forward that
grey cats should
feel free to make as many industrially
themed armors as they'd like
and that between its style of ships the
shuttles and the landing zones
crusader is fast becoming a fan favorite
manufacturer
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
[Music]
you
