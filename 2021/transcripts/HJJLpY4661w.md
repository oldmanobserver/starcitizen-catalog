hi everybody
welcome to star citizen live dynamic
events with tony zurovic
i'm your host jared huckabee and if
you've never seen star citizen live
before it's where we take about an hour
out of the end of our week
and check in with developers see what
they're doing
talk about the things that they're
working on sometimes we watch them make
something live
today we have a gentleman who's probably
no stranger to most star citizens
but we're going to take the time to
introduce them anyway meet tony zurovic
tony how you doing man hi how's it going
uh tony zurbak director of persistent
universe
all right so the director of persistent
universe we're just going to jump right
into this
the last time we saw you was citizencon
2949
years right i checked in with our data
solutions teams we've gained over 500
000 citizens since then so somebody
watching right now has no idea who you
are
so take a few moments before we jump
into this uh tell them
who you are what the director of
persistent or what what your position
does
some of the things you work on how am i
get out of your way
uh i have uh i put i i have a lot of
focus on what i'd say is like
the you know the the simulation of the
world getting all the
systemic elements operational uh ai and
mission
architecture um back-end services that
provide a lot of information to the game
servers
um also you know a lot a lot of uh
you know you know some of the
occupational stuff we're working on you
know some advanced bounty hunting you
know functionality
a lot of the the the interfaces you know
for everything from uh
you know from shops to insurance to you
know to
cargo loading just it's really a wide
variety of things
um all over the map those the systemic
services that like the day-to-day
operation of the persistent
life in the persistent universe kind of
thing yeah i mean
there's you know there's multiple
aspects of that
historically it's been um you know
all you know a lot of you know focus on
the persistent stuff that's now starting
to shift over
um you know to to a new group is
basically going to take it and run with
that
um and we're going to basically affect a
you know hand over a transition and
we're basically taking some of those you
know some of those existing resources
and we're going to re-task them with
helping to add
some additional bandwidth into some of
these areas that we've been wanting to
flesh out for an extended period of time
but there are always you know so many
other higher priorities and we think
just
you know as of pretty recently like
within the
you know the last you know literally you
know month or so we've finally
eliminated enough of the bottlenecks on
the back inside
to where we can you know you know pretty
confidently
uh support you know you know
you know at least 20 000 players you
know concurrently
might be higher it's difficult to say
until you actually get you know
until you actually you know stress test
some of these things but
we we ran into some problems at the
fleet week the 2020 fleet week
and we took you know uh we took the
lessons we learned there and it was
it was kind of unfortunate timing in
that particular case
because we knew that we weren't going to
be able to support you know more uh you
know
dramatically more players than we had in
the near-term past when we launched that
event
and we didn't you know really think that
was you know going to be a problem
because
we had you know for the you know for the
previous you know year
we had it in our development schedule to
deliver
you know the final bits of icash and to
basically scale a number you know the
loadout service the variable service
um you know all you know uh to to cash
all the login credentials all this type
of stuff
that we're supposed to you know to
alleviate to mitigate a lot of these
bottlenecks and unfortunately
that that last fleet week event proved
to be so popular that
you know we wound up you know uh during
probably about twice the number of
concurrent users
that we actually expected um and so what
that did is
it it caused it it caused us to
reprioritize some things so that we
could get
select pieces of that you know of that
functionality out sooner
and many of those things are now
operational and so while there's still
definitely plenty more to do um we think
that we've got
a decent amount of head of room given
where we you know given what
given where we think the you know the
the uh the community involvement is
going to be for the next few quarters
um you know and then longer term we've
obviously got you know some
some major you know some major
initiatives you know still on the
horizon
you know like server meshing which is
where we're actually looking to
you know distribute the workload across
as many servers as is necessary so we
can start to scale up the actual number
of
players within a given you know you know
uh instance or
chart of the game all right so
you you just mentioned you know uh
knowing where players are going to be
and stuff
for the next couple uh a couple quarters
uh that brings us to the topic
of this particular show which is dynamic
events
now dynamic events is a phrase that our
community has heard
several times whispers here and there
over the last year
almost two years going back to 2019 uh
back when we refer to it as timed events
and
some of the monthly reports stuff let's
just start things off
with a primer here what is a dynamic
event
so you have to give a little bit of
explanation first like the long-term
objective for star citizen
has always been a dynamic evolving
universe
most of our existing content to date
though has been inherently static
so missions are offered at a given price
at a particular location because
a designer dictated it not because
something within the economic pipeline
actually required that work be done
so uh if you're refueling reloading or
repairing a ship that doesn't actually
increase the demand and thus the price
for the associated commodities and
components
at refineries or shops similarly the
the likelihood of running into a pirate
on a given route doesn't waver
regardless of whether a lot of unarmed
cargo transports carrying valuable
materials start traveling that path
so quantum which is the simulation that
i showed
off at the last citizencon that's the
primary method by which we're going to
address this
and it simulates the effect of
a vast amount of ai and it then feeds
those results
you know to the game and then factors
player actions back into the simulation
so you wind up with this very logical
ebb and flow that you'd expect and that
creates
a lot of temporary opportunities for
people to exploit in general
uh it just makes the game feel far more
interesting to play
so dynamic events are different you can
think of them
uh you can you can think of them a bit
as
designer driven short stories that can
be layered on top
of quantum's systemic background and
they can be triggered manually
or automatically when certain conditions
are met so if the system decides that
war is broken out in an area or we
or we just decide that we want to liven
things up a little
then designers and writers can inject
a lot of precisely curated content into
the game
and the impact of those modifications
will then be blended
into the simulation that's really
you said there's there's two ways to
trigger them either we we can set up
we can set up situations criterias in
which the
the players meet them and the system
automatically goes oh yeah
trigger this particular event that's
been designed or we can trigger them
manually uh
just describe to me the difference there
why why would we use
one over the other for a particular
situation well it's actually similar to
all a lot of what we've done with the
normal development cycle which
is on the one hand we're putting out a
live product and so we have to build you
know we have to have something
that the community can play right now
but at the same time we're planning for
the future and so if you think about
shops as an example
if all that a shop was going to do was
basically offer a certain number of
items for sale or particular price
then the effort that we've expended to
get us to here
you know was you know was was
dramatically over
engineered and it's been the you know
it's been that you know it's been that
way for
you know for the last two and a half
years and it's only now that you're
starting to bring in
quantum and have quantum start to
dictate some of this information these
services which can cache this
information they're also responsible for
basically
receiving callbacks from the individual
shops and then feeding you know
you know on occasion um some of those
transactional events
back to the mission instances that are
running on some of these servers
that you start to see why we made
some of the choices we did back then in
other words it's kind of like before you
can get around to building the
skyscraper you have to lay the
foundation
and so we've said this so many times in
the past um
and we're starting to get to the point
now to where we're starting to
exploit you know some of these
underlying pieces i mean
quantum is another perfect example in
that regard in that
we have these so-called probability
volumes that
dictate what sort of stuff you can
encounter in a given you know
area of space and then we have shops and
we have you know service beacons
and we have all these you know uh you
know different systems
but right now designers go in and you
know even
even missions what missions are
available where and for what amount of
money
and you know what level of risk you know
you're going to
incur when you actually accept them
that's all fixed right now the designers
are
able to set up these data structures
but what we haven't previously been able
to do is provide the real-time dynamic
inputs that would allow us to make these
things ebb and flow
in other words if there's currently a
lot of pirates in an area
then having something delivered to that
area should logically
cost more there's you know there's a
greater risk you know to you and your
ship
and you know and all that type of stuff
but designers
haven't had the tools to be able to
automatically
feed that type of real-time information
into these
mission archetypes that they're setting
up and we're just now getting across a
wide range of areas into doing some of
that and
you know so there is an update that i'll
be giving within
you know roughly the next few months um
that will basically uh explain
what we've been working on in so far is
not just quantum but also some
uh related you know back-end
technologies to help
uh to help generate this you know this
algorithmic
uh this systemically derived you know
information and then
feed it into the game and in a few cases
we've actually you know we'll actually
be able to demonstrate you know real
actual working examples as opposed to
you know just being theory i always hate
to do
too many you know uh you know repeated
theory talks and so one of the things
we debated doing this presentation a
little bit earlier
but it still would have been in the vein
of yeah it's coming it's coming and so i
intentionally wanted to hold it back a
few extra months
so that we could demonstrate some of
this stuff live and actually show
some of these pieces of tech and
functionality
coming you know coming to fruition yeah
i do want to add uh on top of that just
for the community
uh this this update that tony is talking
about that will come
we're not going to say when we let's be
real we don't have a great history of
saying hey we're going to have this
video out
then uh but we're working on it and
we're
and from what i've already seen it's
pretty awesome tyler's in my chat right
now like tell people it's awesome
it is awesome uh yeah there's there it's
kind of like a
it's kind of like a release to where
there are certain things you want to
demonstrate
and you know there's always a little bit
of uncertainty you know with respect to
development schedules um and and so it's
difficult to say precisely
um but we are already deep into testing
multiple facets of what we're aiming to
deliver so
it's coming yeah just in our long
history of saying hey we're going to
have a special video out at this point
talking about this thing
we our track record's not so good here
so uh just
hang tight all right so right now
on the ptu there's uh there there's a
there is a dynamic event our first
dynamic event called xenothreat that's
currently
being tested now um without spoiling the
event we obviously don't want to break
it down like hey phase one is this you
know we don't want to go
into that much detail but tell us what
xenothread is uh what
and what are what we're hoping to
accomplish
there are two primary things on our mind
when thinking about this event and
you know uh we started you know
discussing this internally probably
almost a year ago you know back in
you know first quarter 2020 uh what we
wanted to achieve
um and the other thing that we wanted
besides
you know it being fun uh was that it
wouldn't
cause us to deviate too much from the
natural
trajectory of the development effort in
other words it couldn't be too
disruptive we wanted to take the things
that you know logically followed in
terms of development effort
and look for ways that we could you know
exploit
and you know reveal you know these two
players and basically improve
you know the overall gameplay experience
and in certain cases of course a little
bit more effort here
uh you know pushing something else back
to free up some bandwidth so that we
could you know polish something you know
a little sooner than it would otherwise
be the case
you know that that always happens and so
one of the primary things that we wanted
to do was get all of the
the mission and back-end infrastructure
operational and this is
uh it's you know for example there's
back in tools now and i'll cover this
you know in the upcoming
presentation to activate and monitor and
deactivate missions
and that's again if you look at
xenothread
the the the amount of work that's gone
into allowing
this you know event to basically be uh
you know to be activated is far larger
than what you're able to see right now
what i mean by that is
it it exposes an entirely different way
for designers to start to set these
things up
um they're able to for example within
the
you know uh when they're crafting the
mission archetype logic they can now
declare these you know the these static
instanced variables
that are managed by the back end and
they also have the concept of
phases which are conditionals that can
be associated with
these variables that are managed by the
back end and the significance of this
is that we can
is that we can coordinate
uh mission logic across all the
different servers and that's how
xenothread fundamentally works which is
we have four phases in this mission
there's the initial the introductory
phase where we're kind of like you know
giving you know
we're hinting that you know something's
to come we're doing some foreshadowing
there's the actual you know javelin
restocking you know phase
then there is you know the climactic
battle scene and then there's the
conclusion
and all of these you know are really the
representative and what
what this event allowed us to do you
know most most importantly
was to test and refine and get all this
you know stuff out
working in the real world like you know
so now you've actually got a dynamic
mission service and you actually have
the concept of you know these you know
the uh these global variables and the
mission and the designers are able to
communicate with them
through you know through subsumption
task archetypes and we're able to do
these conditional
evaluations we're able to basically have
the back end synchronize however many
servers we have
to keep them all in lockstep um and then
there's all sorts of you know
fine-tuning that goes on to where well
if you've got a particular server and
it's in
say phase two and they're restocking
they've got the javelin import
and then oh and the designers can
actually set it up to do things and they
are
things like the number of javelins that
are successfully restocked in phase two
can then serve as an input to
phase three such that the
frequency of support you get from the ue
from the uee navy
depends upon how successful you were
in defending those ships in that earlier
phase and again it's it's
what matters less is the specifics of
what we're doing
you know right this moment with that and
more what we're allowing the designers
to do in the future how we're basically
unlocking them to you know to do lots
more
uh cool stuff um another big big focus
for this particular event a major one
was from the beginning we knew that we
wanted to put a lot of emphasis you know
for the first time on the capital ship
battles
so there were a litany of changes that
we needed to make
in order to enable this and at the top
at the very top of the list
was how the ai responded to the threat
of torpedoes
so originally and you know i said
this was still true as of about four
months ago when
we when we finally got to the major you
know the major push in that regard
originally neither turrets nor ships
tasked with defending a capital ship
paid them any heed and that meant that
it was way too easy to take these
capital ships out in the early days
it was literally trivial was no fun at
all and so we spent
you know over a month fine-tuning
various systems
so that counter measures would be
launched and worked as expected
turrets would prioritize major incoming
threats like a torpedo over most other
things
uh players would be rewarded for you
know coordinating their attacks with one
another like you're much
you know you tend to be much more
successful if three players launched
torpedoes at the same time
and then you know and and and we built
in
uh into the
logic this the you know this sense to
where it's it's not like
you know it targets proper target
selection
well it what we didn't want to do is
make it is make it too robotic
too precise uh not because you might not
have that a thousand years in the future
but simply because it's not fun and so
what we wanted to do you know if it
targets perfectly
and if it's able to you know perfectly
shift is it its attention
it you know uh you know it it simply
didn't deliver
the you know the the gameplay feeling
that we wanted and so again we've spent
weeks and weeks tweaking fine-tuning
this until we were internally pretty
happy with the results
another good example was the the idris
the interest was originally pretty
suicidal
in that it would happily engage the
javelin and get destroyed
as long as it managed to get off its
railgun and so
its logic wound up evolving to the point
where it's now much more opportunistic
it wants to use its railgun
but only when that doesn't put it in too
much danger and then one other thing
that we noticed was that uh the turret
the turret targeting
couldn't be so boolean uh it couldn't
focus a hundred percent of its attention
on an attacker that was only
slightly more attractive than another
player
because again it looked artificial and
most importantly it just wasn't very fun
for the other players you know we were
getting internal reports of
you know you you have you know eight
turrets you know you know active on a
ship
and you got you know and you've got 16
players and that you know
when it was so bullying at the at least
half the players
were not having you know we're not
having any of that you know uh
you know firepower focused on them even
for instance and so they
you know they they felt you know you
know they felt relatively bored in terms
of the danger presented to them i want
to be shot at
if you're if you're attacking if you're
jumping in the battle with an idris and
a javelin you want to be shot at you
want to feel like i'm a threat
shoot at me yeah it's a there's a
there's a lot more
fuzziness in grain and it took time to
basically work through all these details
i mean we we sat through every you know
every single week reviewing what
you know how how it looks when you
basically fire individual torpedoes at a
ship
you know how it looked when you fired
multiple torpedoes how it looked if you
fired multiple torpedoes with
a very small you know differential in
time versus a large differential in time
um you know how the ship responded when
it still had countermeasures available
and then another
aspect of this was the support ships
that basically defend these capital
ships it's the same thing to where
even if you're firing upon them if a
torpedo is launched at the capital ship
they'll see that as a greater that break
off potentially at risk to themselves
and prioritize dealing with that torpedo
um and so there's a multitude of these
things that have to be worked through
and
there's of course you know there's
there's more we could do there's more we
will do
it's by no means you know perfect but
you know
it's it's it's light years i mean i
hesitate to say it's light years beyond
where we were
you know when this started because some
of this stuff hadn't even
realistically gotten off the ground and
now it's actually in
in some of these select areas it's
actually quite mature
you mentioned a couple things i want to
follow up on uh first off the
the the process of bringing capital ship
battles
to life and all the balance decisions
and all the new technologies that we're
required to bring up
that's actually the topic of next week's
isc so you know
we've got a lot there yeah some of it
you just heard from tony but you will
dive into more detail in next week's isc
i wanted to talk to you about other
things you touched on you mentioned
some shared information between servers
yeah and and that's something relatively
new that that that's an issue
this is literally the first
demonstration of you know of this tech
there's more to come like another thing
we're
working on the back inside is like right
now we have the ability to
when the designers you know craft this
mission logic
all of that logic previously all the
logic all the data was basically stored
on the server so if you have 200 servers
you had 200 different instances and so
what you're now seeing is like the you
know the first example of us
allowing the designers to split it into
it's kind of like a
client server architecture but for you
know but for mission logic
to where they can dictate this logic
runs on the individual server instance
and it's got its own local variables
and it can interface with variables it
can interface with functions that are
also executed on the back end
and so what this allows us to do is you
know like i was saying earlier it's like
you can have an individual mission
instance of this xenothread on a given
server and you can register
that you did or did not successfully
defend this javelin you know
did you sufficiently restock it it left
and you were victorious
or did it suffer so much damage that it
had to run away and so we actually tally
the number of
you know of successful restockings and
then like i said earlier
that directly impacts um how
how quickly that javelin is going to
come support you
assuming you need it in those later
stages and again the
the important point there is it's it's
just it's representative you know what
we've done now is
work out you know the you know the the
details of the tech put it into white
operations you can kind of think of
xenothread as
the first used case and it focused our
efforts to get all
you know to get all this stuff working
and there is a lot more that you'll be
seeing you know in the
yeah in both the near and farther term
um
dynamic events um dynamic events are
something that there's going to be
continual focus on
uh for the foreseeable future for
example
you know the the next fleet week is
actually going to be running off of you
know
you know off of these you know these
these same fundamental principles
um we've got another dynamic event which
we're referring to as nine tails
lockdown
and it introduces
you it's not live yet but we're already
well into testing uh you know the
so-called shop modifiers we can now have
mission logic effect at a global scale
and and we've resolved all of the
coordination between the different
servers and issues like that so you can
now apply
shop modifiers you can apply probability
volume you know volume modifiers
you can you can basically lock down
areas of space you know inhibit quantum
travel within them
um what will be coming in the not too
distant future will be things like
you know population control uh you know
control of the actual spawn managers
things of that sort
access to areas and you think about this
like what is
fleet week other than at a certain time
we're going to go ahead and
open the doors to a certain area and
allow you entrance and
in the case of some of the you know some
of these upcoming events
when those events are active we want to
create we want to basically
you know we've decided as designers and
it would be fun if we're doing a fleet
week event then we want to
increase the you know the demand for
party favors and alcohol
and fireworks or you know whatever other
types of commodities temporarily at this
location
and so for the duration of this event we
crank up the demand
the price goes higher we broadcast that
information to players let them know hey
by the way
you know the you know the the prices in
this particular area for these
particular quantities are getting out of
whack
you might want to take advantage of you
know this temporary opportunity and
focus on that
and so all of this is um
completely new functionality it's
basically give you
you're adding additional you know you're
adding additional
paints to you know uh to you know to
what the designers can use
you know to craft the you know to craft
these you know portraits that they're
making
so so yes uh uh you now know what the
next dynamic event is
uh well then there there's there's
there's go there's going to be
it's we're just going to be you know
keep rolling out we've actually uh
we've probably got you know eight or ten
specific
ones planned and like i said each one is
looking to leverage stuff that's come
before and then add you know add some
new functionality
okay um
we talked a bit about how you know with
with the dynamic events
it it now allows you know cross-server
progress and stuff like that you know
the events on one server
you know get tallied up with the events
of another server with another server
you know to affect the next phase you've
got the nine tails lockdown where we can
where we can now affect dynamically
affect the price of shops and stuff like
this
um one of the things you you touched on
and again i just want to follow up on
something
you said no deviation from the existing
you know you know development uh how
important not
just just be clear it's it's not that
there's no deviation it's it's that
you're you're trying basically
we have a long-term plan of things we
want to get done and it logically makes
sense to do
this before this other piece of tech etc
and so
you you don't in general want to deviate
too dramatically
purely for the sake of an arbitrary
event in other words
if if if not for xeno threat we could
have done something else that would also
be interesting
but it was time in the natural course of
things we needed to basically start
getting
you know the the back end coordination
of these events we needed to get that
operation we needed to bring the capital
ships online you know the torpedo stuff
is something that's been bought you know
uh the you know that's something that's
been bothering a long time
so all of those things now some of those
bits of tech when we started last year
they weren't going to be addressed
for another six months and you know and
so we did re-prioritize some things so
what i was saying earlier is
you don't want to completely upend your
your logical development schedule but
you certainly refine it you tweak it you
basically massage things around based
upon so you're kind of like looking for
the intersection of
what's within you know what's within
your grasp if not
if if not absolutely all going to be
there unless you actually put some focus
on it and then once we kind of lock that
down it becomes a very
uh a very good means of focusing your
you know
focusing everyone's attention to where
we know exactly how we're going to be
using
you know everything from you know
everything from capital ship combat to
the shop transactions that we can now
have you know fed back into the mission
logic to
a vast multitude of other things now you
hit exactly what i wanted you to hit
there
that you know these things don't detract
or derail from the development
they actually focused in and bear down
on things that we already intended to do
they just bring them into a more uh
crystalline focus for a bit
um that said
there had to be some concerns that there
there had to be that there had to be
some
dangers inherent there had what were
some of the things we needed to look out
for
while we were working what scared us
about this
the the biggest concern from the
beginning i would say
um was going to be performance we knew
performance was going to be an issue
um it continues to be an issue we've got
a
number of initiatives underway to
basically improve that
um and then we're also attacking it you
know from a completely different angle
which is not just the per server of
performance but
you know the whole server meshing you
know initiative is intended to
eventually allow us to distribute the
workload over as many servers you know
as
we need and so that was always something
that we um
were aware we were aware of um
we've basically tweaked and refined
things we
you know uh you know uh you know the the
maximum number of enemies you face
in other words do you face 50 enemies at
once or do you basically face
you know uh you know a dozen and we keep
replenishing them as you you know
as you destroy them or take them out
make them flee basically replenish them
you know quicker
um how many capital ships can you know
can we put you know you know
at a time uh there's been a tremendous
amount of focus on
um optimizing everything from you know
turned ai
to even seemingly unrelated things like
um you know
social ai it's like any time you're
saving there is basically additional
time that you can
inject into you know into these events
that are
that are intended to basically uh draw
lots of players together and have you
know
you know and have an enormous amount of
ai you know active
if you think about i mean this is
definitely uh
this is definitely um the biggest such
event we've done today and we're putting
more
more players and more ai um and you got
you know tons of turrets operation
you you have a lot of stuff happening in
one area
and so it's it you know it it's it's
like with most things right which is
your first iteration of these things
is never as mature as you would like
in terms of the performance and you know
uh
yeah we're going to keep refining it i
think you'll see some big improvements
over the course of the next few quarters
um and we'll go from there all right so
yeah so we're about halfway through
we're talking with tony zuravek
uh big head honcho guy for the
persistent universe
in systemic systems uh remember if
you're watching live on twitch right now
you can submit questions with the word
question
in capital letters surrounded by
brackets that's going to help tyler and
our community management team pull those
out from the conversations
remember to try to keep the questions
related to the stuff we're talking about
today
so if you're asking about when your
favorite ship's going to come out or
something that's
not really the stuff we we take tony's
time with um
tony you mentioned that
that designers get uh that designers can
use dynamic events
uh for all manner of things uh we just
showed an isc how the uh
the terrain modification tool will make
things easier for designers to
to craft and and alter the uh the
service of planets and stuff
dynamic events isn't just a feature for
players it's also a tool
for our developers and our designers
what are what are some of the ways
that dynamic events can help our
designers uh make
better and more dynamic uh stuff for
star citizen
well it's like i was saying earlier what
what dynamic events really are
is what we set up by default is what i
would call like the systemic background
right that's what quantum is good at
which is
it's like the real world economy you
know things have been that things flow
but in general you don't have
major financial crises or great
depressions or wars you know
you know on a regular basis but the
reality you know for you know from a
gameplay perspective
is you actually want you know a little
bit of chaos here and there and
sometimes
we the designers want to go in and
specifically massage this like oh
you know what this area the solar system
has been kind of boring today we're
going to liven it up
and so what these dynamic events allow
us to do
is basically uh to seamlessly integrate
a chunk of you know designer and writer
driven content
into this background simulations so that
how it interfaces with the you know the
world is you know as
it currently exists it's it's all
logical it's exactly what you think in
other words
you know for example if we introduce a
horde of pirates
at a particular location well those
pirates they're going to need fuel
they're going to need ammo they're going
to need you know ship repairs all of a
sudden you know
um you would expect to basically you
know see lots more missions for
you know uh you know escorts of
transport ships you know
you know in that area um you'd see you
know more bounties you know being just
you know uh bounty service beacons being
dispatched that area
so you have all of these other logical
knock-on effects you would like
and those they get for free but you
think about it's like
in xeno threat there's all this custom
dialogue and stuff
geared towards this and you got to go
you know you got to go record the
specific lines and you know and trigger
them up so
so it's basically what i would describe
as the best
of both worlds which is you know it's
it's it's a it's a big open world and
you can do whatever you want and make
whatever choices you want and the game
will respond logically and if you're
you know particularly clever you'll
occasionally you know figure it out you
know some
some cool opportunities um and then at
the same time
whether we manually do it or whether on
occasion quantum decides you know what
there's been
so much you know battling in this area
that we're going to go ahead and
activate a compatible dynamic event that
says oh
you know and so the way these things are
configured is you can think of it
a bit like a programming function to
where they've got
certain requirements certain inputs that
have to be fed to them
and so what the system is basically
looking for is at any given time is
for the you know for the inputs in any
given area
what kind of content does it have that
it can match up and so i mentioned like
dynamic events but there's an entire
there's a middle layer to this which is
so here you know here to for today um
you've had
the the normal what i'd call the static
missions and then at the far end of the
spectrum you've got these dynamic events
and in between you've actually got
what i just what i've always referred to
as dynamic missions
and dynamic missions uh they kind of
split the difference to where
they're going to be systemically
generated all over the place you you
constantly see them
they'll look very much like right now if
you're in an area and there's a high
probability of pirates we actually
create you know a pirate encounter
mission or you can create a cargo
transport ship mission or a conflict or
whatever the case may be
where what dynamic missions do um
is basically allow us at a at a smaller
more localized scale now we're not
talking about trying to coordinate this
across you know multiple servers or
anything like that
it's just that cargo ship that you run
into in this area of space
what type of cargo should it have should
it be copper should it be platinum
should it be aluminum
it probably depends logically it would
depend upon well
is it coming from you know uh you know
from an area
you know where you know uh where it
purchased those things where that stuff
is mined refined you know et cetera and
where is it going to and so
if it's heading one direction if it's if
the cargo transport is going
uh you know uh from the refinery to the
factory then you would expect that it's
going to be loaded with goods the
refinery produces and if
if the cargo ship is headed towards the
you know the refinery then
it you know then it likely has raw ore
that needs to be you know processed et
cetera and so the point being
designers don't need to you know with
the with the with the dynamic mission
system they don't need to fill in things
like hey for this cargo transport
mission
what kind of cargo you know does it have
uh should it be beat up or should it be
in pristine condition
should it have fighter escorts or you
know or should it just be traveling solo
um you know should it basically be
you know a derelict husk in space that
you stumble upon or should it basically
you know be
you know in in in perfectly fine
pristine you know condition
so these all become inputs to these
setups so the designers set up
the archetypes and the system fills in
the inputs and what you wind up getting
is you know an exponential increase in
variety because all of a sudden
designers aren't trying to hard code
every single specific you know
specific instance and so you can think
of dynamic events as it's really just an
evolution of that system that adds on
some additional
you know back-end coordination and
uh and those those those modifiers that
i talked about earlier to where dynamic
events really do
they grant the designer the temporary
capability
to nudge certain things in the
simulation
a particular way uh you know whether you
know whether it be
new items added to a shop's inventory
whether it be uh
additional demand for an item at a
particular shop
whether it be you know uh you know uh
missions that are gonna be offered here
uh you know all of those sorts of you
know sorts of things and so i mentioned
like population control you can see
uh you know a fleet week in the future
will be a dynamic event
and when that event is going on we're
going to turn the dial and crank up the
population you know we're going to wind
up doubling it you know because you'd
expect to see a lot of people coming to
see that show
and then when the event dissipates then
we'll basically turn the turn that dial
back down the population will
you know uh recede back to its normal
levels in other words
it's a special event that we've come in
we've added a ton of
custom content mpc conversations all the
stuff geared towards that and so we kind
of view it as
one big comprehensive designer driven
package
that can be merged with all of this you
know this back end systemic you know uh
background
i'm sorry i got distracted there was a
ascii art of tyler wearing a
american top hat thing it was weird um
you you mentioned you mentioned that uh
you know there's a specif there's
there's the systemic triggers
the things that you know that can
trigger all these things by
by just meeting criteria and then the
manual triggers uh some of the folks in
the chat are asking if the manual
triggers are akin to like
the old gm events that you that you
would see in
in uh older mmos where where where you
know
a design in this case a designer as
opposed to a gm can come in and
just create a one-time event that would
occur
that that that's exactly it and some of
these will be one time like the xena
thread or a particular fleet week or
other other ones will basically just add
to our library of things and you know
you know that we can activate simply
because we want to liven up the place
the nine tails i don't want to go into
you know the nine tails i don't want to
go into like the detail because
you know there's some cool stuff that
we'll be introducing
that players haven't you know that they
haven't really seen before so i want to
kind of you know keep
you know keep some of it under under
under wraps um
but it's it's it's very representative
of some of the
bits of functionality that we're
introducing in there will then be
exploited
in more dramatic fashion in in
subsequent you know dynamic events
like a uh one high level example would
simply be
the nine-tail stuff is kind of geared
towards a certain area
you know basically being you know locked
down as a result of aggression
um and in the future what we're gonna
wind up having is
if the player community doesn't beat
back that particular threat
then it will grow and all of a sudden
you've got two or three or four
different areas locked down in other
words you
you the player community have to respond
and tamp out this fire
or else it will gradually grow now it's
possible of course depending upon how we
set it up and what the current inputs
it's like
the npc population in some cases may
eventually respond sufficiently to do it
um but but but you get you know the
overall effect which is
the this the this one event that's
geared towards locking down an area
the area to be locked down is you know
is an input
and we can feed it one we can feed it
three we can basically add a little bit
of back-end logic controls
and then that and then which ones are
locked down can be replicated across
all of the servers so the community as a
whole is fighting just like they are in
xeno threat
against this common thread that just so
that that
i'm just going to do this for clarity's
sake a lot of the folks have been asking
whether xenothread specifically is a
one-time event
to play it and it's never back or
whether it may come back uh i know from
internal conversations we're reserving
our options there whether you know
xenothread is going to be a one-time
thing or
it's going to come back but we have the
option though
that's that's the important part for
this conversation is that we can do
these
one-time limited events that occur in
star citizen's history
and when they're done they never return
ever again
or we can do ones that are recurring or
we can do ones that build
upon each one where it's like it's like
this is a one-time thing but it leads
into another event
x number of months later leads into
another event x number of months later
and that's how we start adding a
persistent and long-form storyline
to the persistent universe yeah this one
you know the xenothread is basically you
know attacking harassing the uee
um and you're you know you're there to
basically help you know
uh to help you know beat back you know
some of the specific challenges
to basically salvage material to restock
the javelin defend transport ships you
know to you know to the same
effect all this type of stuff um in the
future there
may very well be ones where you actually
have to go into
you know you know occupied space so it's
really dangerous to get there infiltrate
bases
retrieve stuff bring it back and then
what we'd be measuring is well how much
you know total
information or assets or stolen ships
that you've retrieved et cetera how many
have you know has the community pulled
back and again
that well i keep referring to like the
community because in general these
dynamic events
are meant to be things that apply across
the entire
spectrum of servers and not isolated
onto
a you know just one individual instance
um if you're talking about just an
individual server instance then you're
really talking more of you know like i
said earlier with like the dynamic
missions to where
if if it's all on one server then you
don't need all this back-end
coordination and variable maintenance
and you know phases and all that you can
literally just
run it with your normal you know
subsumption mission logic
um let's look at some of the questions
from the live chat here
uh some of these we've touched on but
we'll go ahead and ask them just for
clarity's sake
um oh as far as the size of dynamic
events
uh are are they limited in scope until
quanta is
fully on on board and up and running or
will they always just be some of them
smaller some of them
massive uh is there a scale you have in
mind
but it's actually exactly it's both it's
like some of them will be really large
like xeno threat it puts the whole you
know solar system you know if they're
you know theoretically under stress
under threat uh others will be much more
localized that that is like our first
test
like for this nine tails lockdown it's
much more localized as a threat to
a specific landing zone so if you have
no interest
in that particular landing zone and the
shops that are have been you know
have been cut off you know from the
world and aren't be and aren't able to
get the supplies that they need and
therefore they're all calling out for
help and the price is going through the
roof what they pay to get medical
supplies and all this other stuff
um then you can you know then you can
largely ignore it and so
the the idea is again it's like we're
building a library and what you know big
you know invasion you know you know
fleet invasions you know of a solar
system
smaller things which is you know just a
particular you know pirate gang
assaulting a particular landing zone
will have you know infiltration stuff
it's really again it's like
uh you're you're aiming to get the tools
to allow the designers to basically
express
solutions to all of these you know
dramatically different scenarios
um now it's we've mentioned quantum and
quantum well not several times during
the show for folks who have been
watching and i'm looking at the chat
here that don't know what we're talking
about
there is a nice hour-long about
presentation available on our youtube
page
from citizencon 2949 where tony
introduced the entire concept of quanta
we don't want to
waste our remaining minutes here just
regurgitating what's already been shared
that said it has been more than a year
since we've
since we've heard about it since we've
heard from you uh i know we have that
presentation coming in the next x number
of months
without spoiling that can you give us a
bit of an update on
how things have been progressing whether
you're happy with where where we're at
right now
um yeah it's it's come a long way um
all the you know the typescript logic
has been redone in c sharp for the ai uh
which basically resulted in you know
somewhere in the range of you know three
order of magnitude
increase so we we can basically easily
simulate
several million quanta um you know and
we can do that at you know
at multiples of normal speed and that's
important because
we need to be able to tweak certain
levers let the simulation run for an
hour and then see how
stuff kind of balanced out and what kind
of uh you know what kind of limits
uh we hit on certain things did prices
ever get too out of whack here
was you know did the the offering price
for particular mission ever get you know
completely you know
ridiculous given these parameters that
we'd set up um there's
been we're we're in the final stages now
of starting to
connect quantum to some of the back-end
services so that they're actually
feeding
data from the simulation to the services
the services will have long been
feeding that information then to uh to
you know to the actual game servers and
then basically receiving it back
like uh one of the one of the most uh
recent examples here is
uh just yeah and it's kind of related to
the dynamic event shot modifier stuff
which is
the potential to add items you know add
new items
to a particular shop so right now that
inventory has always historically been
fixed and so
now with the modifier since we can add
something it's the same thing you'll see
in quantum which is shops may
occasionally change
some of their inventory items and so it
turns out that there's a little bit of
work we
need to do on the game server in order
to support that um
there are there there's been
uh a lot of you know a lot of focus on
basically getting you know extracting
you know chunks of information from uh
you know the service beacons that we
demonstrated before we were generating
the events but they weren't actually
making where they were in the back end
uh so that information will be filling
up in other words where
you see calls for assistance calls for
combat assistance for you to come you
know
will in you know in the not too distant
future be dictated
via that quantum simulation um the you
know the
the the price of fuel will be dictated
by what you know how much of a
you know how much of a load there is in
that particular area and all these
things take time because
the the previous iteration we showed of
quantum as you got all these quantity
going around
they didn't uh they didn't have at that
time any concept of
fuel or you know efficiency in terms of
what ship they were flying and how much
fuel it consumed
um they basically got transport you know
for free and so a lot of those type of
things are being wrapped up
we spent uh relatively recently a good
bit of time
um getting quantum the service to
actually
ship to basically be built and ship with
the game so we're not currently
exploiting it
but it's there right alongside you know
you know a litany of all these other
services
so that piece which you know which was a
significant effort
is now in and done and basically what
that means is we've got the
we've got the basic elements of plumbing
to get all this information you know
going back and forth
and what we're focused on right now is
actually you know
is is realizing some of that stuff star
citizen
we've got the plumbing
if we plug tony z into the servers would
they go faster
i'm imagining like remember superman 3
where the where the gal gets
plugged into the servers let's see what
else we got
will some of the dynamic events allow us
to choose sides
if we're more into the outlaw phase the
threat has everybody on one side right
but not but it's not really i mean
you're you're you're encouraged to be on
one side and yet
plenty of players are electing to
basically you know
they're not actually they're not able to
ally you know with the xeno threat
but they're certainly not being you know
friends to
you know to the local security forces so
yeah yes we will
we've actually got you know you know
some of that stuff like in
the ninetails lockdown we're starting to
play with some of those concepts to
where
you can be that you can basically work
on the side of the guys helping to keep
it locked down or you can basically work
on the side of the guys trying to
break that blockade and basically you
know free that free that area
so the the the fact that there isn't a
a way to officially plug in with the
other side in xeno thread isn't
indicative of
some future design direction it's just
that's not what this one not not at all
in fact it's actually quite the opposite
because
as is always the case with star citizen
um and
you you know you you saw you see this
with so many things that we did with
xeno threat right like
with xeno threat we kind of started out
with okay we're gonna have big
you know we have capital ships so any
player with bombers they're set and then
the concern was wait a lot of players
don't have bombers how are they going to
contribute
what if i've got to horn it and so we
introduced the concept of okay we'll
have a lot of support
you know light fighters supporting these
ships and you can win you can basically
make
uh the the make the idris uh you know uh
retreat and therefore tim you know win
that battle simply by taking out all
those light fighters
but and so all of a sudden now it's like
regardless of which
you know whether you've got the the
heavy bomb or whether you've got the
light fighter
you can contribute but that still left
the problem of well what if
you know what if i'm not the kind of
player that wants to do tons and tons of
endless ship combat
what do i get to do in this xeno threat
thing and that's where the thing you
know that's where we
started thinking hey let's have this
whole salvage aspect where the javelins
come in you're basically restocking them
so now someone's got to go
out and basically get the materials and
of course we've got to have a little bit
of fps combat you know on that
but then all of a sudden that forces you
into that fps mode so
we start looking and thinking what if i
actually do like the ship combat
but i you know but i want to be able to
contribute to the restocking and not
be forced into that well you've got
transport ships going by you know going
back and forth
and on occasion you'll be asked to
defend them and if you successfully
defend them
you basically wind up generating as much
restocking benefit as if you were to
fully salvage one of those derelict
ships and so the point i'm making is is
regardless of what exactly you know you
want to do what you find interesting we
try as much as possible
to make sure that there's going to be
you know a sufficient diversity
diversity of interesting things to do
such as you'll have a good time
and so right at the very top of that
list would be sure some a lot of players
are going to on occasion
want to be able to play the part of the
bad guy some other players will want to
you know play the part of the good guy
and you know some players uh
like if if you think about you know
without going into too much detail on
the nine tails you know lockdown
when you're actually trying to deliver
those supplies are you trying to
simply quell to take out all of the
pirates in that area basically remove
the threat
or are you basically just trying to
transport goods in
and basically take advantage of the
sky-high prices that are temporarily
being paid because no one else can get
through that blockade and then
if you're actually if you're one of
those guys trying to transport those
goods through
all of a sudden there's a real need for
you to
hire via service beacon hire other
people to protect you
and so you've got escort potential you
got back you know you can basically be
the guys helping to lock it down you can
be the guy helping to eliminate you know
the threat
there's many different ways to come at
the you know
at this particular situation depending
upon what interests you
and that is ultimately you know what
where we're trying to go
all across the game yeah uh plug-ins for
players in different professions and who
play different ways
for people who just prefer the fps
aspects you know things for them to do
for the people who prefer ship combat
for the people who prefer ship
shipping stuff like that that said there
have been a number of questions
about drilling down to other specific
aspects you just talked about
making sure there's something for almost
everybody in all these things
but on the flip side would we ever
consider because
pvp is quite important for a lot of
folks
you know who play star citizen would we
ever consider a pvp specific
dynamic event or a dynamic event that
has no combat at all
well the the pvp stuff is you know
something you always i mean if you're
gonna have freedom you know some people
are gonna basically
you know want to get in there you know
and muck it up you know for other people
and so the the way that i
would aim to address that type of stuff
is basically
uh yeah within the rules of the system
in other words that that was why and
again we're still in the early stages of
the whole prison thing that that's why
that's why we have a prison concept
which is you can be a bad guy and
if you get caught then you basically go
you go serve your sentence and right now
when i say the early stages i mean like
right now escaping from prison
equates to walking through you know a
hole in the wall and basically assuming
you actually know the escape route then
you know then it's just a matter of time
and that's another thing that you know
we've got you know a few quarter dollars
to basically do a major revision to make
the entire process of escaping prison is
going to be a challenge in and of itself
and there's going to be multiple ways
it's like are you talking about
you know basically uh bribing guards are
you talking about you know coordinating
with other players you talking about
being in the other guy that's simply
trying to avoid the cameras and do the
whole time
thing you know of you know setting up
distractions you know uh you know you
know setting a fire in the utility
closet to basically draw the guards over
so you can go over here in other words
how
many different ways can we support
uh you know such that you know a player
can feel as if they've crafted their own
particular solution to you know to the
problem and as much as possible
you don't try to hard code these things
right you try to basically
create uh you know a number of different
systemic elements
and what will inevitably wind up
happening is players will find
clever ways to exploit them to you know
to you know to
to you know to uh to particular effect
we're actually seeing this right now it
was a you know a bit of a headache in
this morning's meeting when i was
talking about the xeno threat stuff we
were going through
pvp and apparently you know some players
have figured out this super clever way
of
very quickly sharing credits and getting
out of prison etc
and it's always the case right which is
it's an ongoing battle
when you when you when you provide a
bunch of these raw elements
people will find you know unintended
ways of basically accomplishing their
effect
i personally have always loved that
because that was always my favorite
thing
in in games was being able to craft
what i felt was my own unique solution
in other words what i don't want to do
is expend
copious amounts of time trying to figure
out the one
solution that the designer dictated
would solve this particular puzzle i'd
rather give players a bunch of you know
these
you know these these logical elements
and they can string them together in all
sorts of ways and that i kind of
referenced that you know just you know
briefly earlier like with the prison
guard which is
well if if prison guards respond
as you know as they must to you know to
audible events
then if you can do something that you
know that generates a noise over here
then of course they should go to
investigate
and so a clever player would basically
say hey like i can
the same way that they'd go investigate
a noise and all and that would become
a problem for you if you're trying to
infiltrate an area
um can actually become a great means for
you to temporarily distract them so that
you can get through you know
you know a door to escape the prison et
cetera and so
uh all of this stuff i mean it comes
back to the same thing which is
giving players the the the freedom
to basically play the game how they want
and having the system
push back in logical fashion so if we
don't want a lot of player versus player
you know stuff in this area then we
should bring
logical elements of the game more you
know more security
you know larger you know penalties in
that particular area
things of that sort to you know to
discourage it it's still possible
but you know but all of a sudden you
know you you so you i wouldn't aim to
reduce it to zero or you know to make it
impossible because
impossible to me is is never
particularly fun
i'd rather make it so that if you want
to basically
accept you know the the consequences of
your actions then more power to you and
in some places
in some places those consequences will
be you know fairly minimal in other
places
they'll be quite large and you see this
across the law system where we've got 40
different infractions
and some things are viewed as you know a
minor little infraction
you basically pay you know pay a fine
other things actually lock you into
prison and right now like i said
it's fairly easy to escape prison it
won't be in the future that will
actually
become a much more significant challenge
so it's it sounds like uh
the approach that we will generally take
is a
try to plug as many different groups and
peoples and play styles into these
events as possible try to provide
something for
as many play styles as we can including
pvp
yeah yeah okay yeah and then the pvp is
just
it's it's an inch it's a you always have
to be sensitive to it because a small
number of players can always ruin the
experience for a lot of other people and
so you do have to put
you know that's not pvp though yeah but
but again but how are you going to deal
with that and certainly
you know there are some aspects you know
uh to where you take you know
administrative you know action but in
general to me
if you have to take administrative
action it usually signifies that you
failed at something within the game
right it's like
in the real world if i go out and i
wreak havoc uh you know that there will
be very real and obvious consequences
that you you know quickly suffer and it
should be the same thing in a game to
where
you can do it but you better be
extremely you know clever about how you
go about it or
you know or you know or or else the
system's going to respond in you know in
logical fashion
all right well tony that's it we made it
to the end
you got anything else you want to you
want to leave people with any any any
final thoughts before
uh xeno threat our first dynamic event
makes its way to the live servers
sometimes uh no other than just uh if
you haven't watched we talked about the
quantum stuff
um if uh for for people that aren't
familiar with it they don't necessarily
need to go back and watch that thing
since we will be
you know doing a you know a pretty a
relatively comprehensive update
um it won't be as singularly focused on
that because there's several other areas
that i want to cover in at least brief
fashion everything you know
uh virtual ai and you know and a number
of other things um
so it's probably like i said you know a
few months out give or take
um and we're hoping to be able to show
some
concrete examples of how some of this
you know some of this
technology is actually now integrated
into the game
awesome well thank you so much tony uh
if the
folks in the chat had their way you do
this once a month every month for the
rest of your life
uh but i understand that you actually
have a job uh ironically if
you know if we did that then there would
be less to discuss you wouldn't get as
much done
there what there would anyone yeah so
yeah so thank you so much i'll let you
get back to work
