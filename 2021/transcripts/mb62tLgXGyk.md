so ever since i was
like a kid really i was interested in
cars
and that interesting cars went to
building them
and then i ended up kind of racing
competitive esports for a while
and that kind of got me into the game
industry which
allowed me to combine pretty much all my
passions really that i have about
vehicles and
build them in video games that's
basically dream come true for me
i've been a fan of both planes and
spaceships and cars
in equally for years it's definitely
something that i am invested in and i
really want to make it good and
everything
my background is physics and so
spaceship physics are grand vehicle
physics it's all physics to me it's it's
excellent and it's a lot of fun
you know making the ground vehicles
better they give us this ability to have
a more varied experience in gameplay
like they're never obviously gonna match
the maneuverability and
abilities of a spaceship but they serve
a different purpose
with a spaceship you can fly around you
can get an overview of the planet
but if you go down on the ground you get
a much
greater sense of the detail and the
skill the universe
at the moment i've been supporting the
work that bjarni's been doing
on ground vehicles which is really
really exciting the
the physics model entire model that he's
been working on is one of the most
interesting things i've seen in a while
so right now we're working on a more
physically based tire model
it's actually built on empirical data so
like real-world data from
from tires so the tire model uh handles
how the
the wheel contacts to the ground and um
so we simulate that actually with uh
this curve that um that
is calculated from the the slip of the
wheel now
the slip of the wheel is actually
is how how fast the wheel is turning how
fast the engine turns the wheel
relative to the ground that's moving
beneath it
the tire model that we're using right
now works fine but it's a little bit too
arcadey
and we want to explore moving into a
more physical
based one so each of the ground vehicles
all are like wildly different ground
vehicles right
having more flexibility over how
you can tune the vehicles and a more
physically accurate way to tune
the vehicles will result in a more
believable experience that is easier for
us to achieve
and as a result it's kind of pushed us
to
improve the system so the result for the
player is that
you will see more vehicles that are
behaving in the way that you expect
um they sort of interact with the
terrain
much more correctly you can slide them
and also have periods of grip and so on
that is what you expect and it's easier
for us to achieve that so you'll get
that
more often so each of the ground
vehicles
you know all the ground vehicles we've
made so far have have very different
roles
[Music]
uh where can the rock improve grand
fields because it was the first
kind of ground vehicle to have a
specific kind of
purpose and place where it needed to be
because it had to be placed in difficult
places to mine
um so we definitely kind of look back
over the technology we had and
we definitely made some improvements
there it definitely feels
better across the surface and also it's
the first ground vehicle that we
properly tuned the camera for that we
had developed previously for the
spaceships
so we've got camera that communicates
when the vehicle is sliding
when you're flying around the corners in
that vehicle you can really feel the
grip that it has
[Music]
we're also working on the tank at the
moment um this has been
a big driving force behind a lot of the
improvements we're making so we've got
access now to a lot more parameters and
it's the first vehicle to use the track
physics which we have so it's
not steering by wheels turning um it's
steering by
difference in speed between the
different treads
tech that's come with a tank is just
some more fine-tuning options now that
we didn't have before
and that drastically improves the feel
and also the ability of the ground
vehicles to do things as well
we're also working on the new cyclone mt
which is
you know kind of made us look at the
kind of missile experience
that we have with the ground vehicles
and how it drastically changes the needs
of the missiles
and how they aim it's also basically
highlighted the
fact that we also need to massively
change how we communicate the ground
vehicle experience
um you know overall with the ui you know
because we don't have
ui for the ground vehicles right now um
you know to the same standard as the
ships
it's quite fair to say that the um it's
probably my favorite um it's probably
one of my favorite vehicles the cyclone
so adding kind of missiles to
that just adds an element of kind of
funny destruction for me
so as far as going because moving
forward where we go is um
we start with a core thai model
improvement
which will drastically improve
the kind of overall physics that drives
the ground vehicle
they're basically on top of that we've
already done some work on the camera
system but we need to create more of a
bespoke experience with camera so you
know we're looking at improvements the
car camera system
and that all come just from a more
realistic physics base we're definitely
not going to go full simulation here and
require you to have a full steering
wheel set up but we want
the same feelings and emotions to be
expressed with the ground vehicle so
that
it feels right and then a big part of
the ground vehicle experience that we
would definitely want to improve is the
lack of the hood
to be fair to be frank with you um and
also just bring the ground vehicles up
to the same standards in terms of all
the systems then in the future add the
missile operator mode ui as well
so you'll have all the same systems that
the ships do
and then someday we'll have coordinates
of the compass on the hood as well so um
you don't get lost
because i get lost quite a lot on the
planets but that's just because i end up
landing somewhere random and
you know just go for a drive and i just
watch the sunset go down
star citizen is more than just a space
game
it's a means to explore the cosmos and
make your way through the universe
charting a path that's uniquely your own
and wherever that path happens to take
you
you're likely to need a ground vehicle
at some point along the way
but when you're not adventuring maybe
you'll spend your time in your
hab your outpost or your local hospital
let's take a look now at how some of
those are progressing and more
in this week's sprint report starting
things off this week
let's begin with some smaller updates
from the eu pu feature team
who just completed a sprint on bug fixes
and visual updates
to existing systems like the refinery
kiosks
including this new welcome splash screen
and a fix to the close window button
that
well wasn't working before they also
added an auto log out for those people
who go to the library and like to leave
their email open for anyone else to see
they also continue to work on the mining
ui in line with the new sub components
we talked about last week
the new additions allow for the display
of precise benefits from each component
and also work for the previous
consumables as well
so players can better and more
knowledgeably tune their mining
experience
they're also working on animating the
scan bars as part of an overall push
to expose more and more information to
the player
members of the modular content team
recently completed a sprint
on the non-commercial overlays for
refinery decks
coming to alpha 313 what you're seeing
here at the moment
is a pre-lighting pass which always does
a lot to sell the proper mood and
atmosphere of industrial areas like this
what they did here was take some of the
more common traversal areas in several
of the stations
and began ripping out many of the
adverts that were present
exposing more of the layered industrial
guts that were previously hidden to the
player from underneath
also gone are some of the seating areas
plants decor
and other amenities found in the larger
stations and a more utilitarian and
functional space
is left in its wake now this isn't being
applied to
every station but only a few select
smaller ones with refinery decks
in an effort to distinguish them a bit
more from their flashier
more commercialized cousins now it may
be a bit
flat looking at the moment but once the
lighting pass changes are in
it'll begin to bring out the personality
a bit more in the smaller
more industrialized stations
if you remember our segment on the
interaction zoo with calyx from last
year
you may be excited to hear that folks
from the lighting team
have begun to dig into his toy box of
technical knickknacks and play things
to set up a habitation test bed of their
own
starting with splitting all of the
existing lighting
into sectional circuits that can be
controlled or affected by the player
individually
such as a proximity sensor in the foyer
to light and delight the entrance
a master control panel with different
lighting states for the entire hab
localized controls for each distinct
area like the kitchen or the bunk
and then in case you still weren't able
to set exactly the mood you're looking
for control of the individualized prop
lights
like lamps giving players unprecedented
control of how they light their own
space
the next step in this prototyping is to
explore integrating the destructible
and replaceable colored lights from the
interaction zoo
providing even more customization
options for players
going forward let's check in on the
continuing white box progress of
hospitals by stepping into new babbage
once more
and seeing where they're at now this is
the view when you leave the service ward
and enter the lobby
and right off the bat we can see the
ceiling has been altered since the last
we saw it
to reveal even more of the aspire grand
up above
the pharmacy is still on the right but
now on the left
we have new information and security
stations as well
now if we head back into the wards
themselves we can find nice communal
areas like this gorgeous view of the new
babbage skyline
off to the left and right leads to nurse
and doctor and trio stations
and many of the kinds of areas you'd
expect to find in a fully functioning
hospital
now even though this is still in white
box phase you can imagine what it'll
look like with new babbage's trademark
signage helping to distinguish between
the various
recovery rooms surgical theaters
storage areas blood labs and more
and if you play like i do you're gonna
spend a lot of time here
so it's important that it can handle the
load
did i make that same joke last time you
bet i did
it's a test to see if anybody's paying
attention to what's being said here
fidelity immersion bespoke
the hospital will really punch above its
weight class
[Music]
now it wouldn't be a sprint report these
days without a continuing look at the
progress of our colonialism outposts
so here's a look at further whitefox
progress
most of the work this sprint was in
determining all the things whitebox is
normally used for
such as working out how all the various
modules will connect
and function with one another figuring
out how to set up the necessary vis
areas while adapting for the sloped
exterior walls
continuing to work out all the necessary
run time environment probes needed
to allow lighting from the exterior to
creep in through the windows to the
interior
and potentially the other way around as
well
basically it's work preserving the
necessary modularity so that these
outposts can work in multiple
configurations while adapting the
blendtec
to properly allow for spill into each
room without noticeable lines everywhere
folks also want to take another pass at
this bathroom area
which is currently feeling a bit too
much like a spaceship and not what we'd
expect to see in a frontier outpost
they're also working with design to mark
out interactable areas or future spaces
for players
to customize their space further with
equipment or even decorative flare
all their own the social space in the
sender has gone through
several iterations in the last couple
weeks as things sometimes do
it began to balloon in size before it
was decided to bring it back in
to a more intimate setting here we see
one of the various connection collars
that can link to a number of different
modules
including this garage we first showed a
couple weeks ago
the current thinking here is that there
should be an airlock here so that the
garage can be depressurized if necessary
on certain planets or moons as well as a
hatch up above
for the very same reason
ultimately it's just nice to follow
along with the continued progress of
these outposts
that'll first be used in npc settlements
across stanton and pyro
and then eventually be rolled out to
player use after that
finally before we let you go this week
there are sprints
and then there are tiny experiments devs
do from time to time to see what's
possible
and recently someone on the vfx team
tried revisiting our existing
lightning effects ahead of some expected
work on pyro
and then combining that with our new and
upcoming emissive particle lighting
system
to see if they could improve the look of
one of star citizen's
oldest assets the dying star from arena
commander
now this is literally a vfx doodle done
during a meeting
but it's got others excited about the
possibilities not just in improving
existing maps like arena
commander but applications elsewhere
like in gas clouds in the persistent
universe
and at the center of the forthcoming
pyro system which was the inspiration
for arena commander's map to begin with
so what we learned this week well we
learned that there are many ways left to
improve the ground vehicle experience in
star citizen
and that some of those are already
underway right now
that there's a new cyclone variant on
the way and driving improvements for all
vehicles
alongside development of the nova tank
and the recently released grey cat rock
that habs may someday let you light up
your life any way you want
and that those outposts just can't come
soon enough
but they'll be worth the wait for inside
star citizen i'm jared huckabee
see you all next week
