and then we'll we'll do this
hi everybody
welcome to star citizen live game dev
life
of
qa i was about to say life of qua and
i'm like no i'm not gonna do that
and then i talked about not doing it so
i just defacto did it i'm your host
jared huckabee and uh if you've never
seen star citizen live before so where
we take about an hour at the end of our
week when we hang out with a with a
collection of our finest uh developers
and george stadler
and talk about uh our work our
experience our life
uh in development as it were uh on
today's show we are jumping into an
often
misunderstood
often
misrepresented
aspect of game development
quality assurance
so before we get started let's take a
few minutes and get to know who our
players are
we will start with someone who probably
needs no introduction but i'm going to
do it anyway she is the she is the
versus very first original jump point
pilot uh you might remember from the
citizencon 2949 demo uh let's give a big
round of applause for samantha haley
thank you guys it's really nice to see
everybody again virtually um yes so i'm
here uh representing qa today um
and through qa i got to do something
really amazing at that citizencon get to
fly the carrick and in front of
everybody and it was such a wonderful
experience to get to do that so it's
great to be back and and to kind of
engage with the community a bit more
again
now what is it that you actually do for
star citizen
so in terms of my my actual job other
than you know flying the carrick
sometimes um i am the lead of the qa
resource team
and basically what that means is i deal
with everything in terms of training up
our new hires
including our
experienced staff as well i go through
uh training with those guys too
we deal with all kinds of guides and
information and making sure that
everybody is you know
at the tip top of their craft for qa
basically
all right
now
joining us on the show we have several
members of the qatar you guys are all
from the uk studio am i not mistaken all
right so we have members from our our uk
studio here uh let's start with a a new
new and improved george
george who are you and what do you do
for star citizen
hello everyone i'm george h
i am currently the um
qa embedded on the network team i've
been with uh cloud now for probably
about a year worked in a few departments
in qa so i've kind of got like a varied
experience different departments um i
was the senior
for sam a while back and then moved on
to the embedded team or the embedded
network team probably around about a
month ago so i am
you know here to help the network do the
networking things basically
so so all the uh all the 30ks are your
fault
harsh um moving on to jack jack who are
you and what do you do for star citizen
uh i'm jack
so i've been dragged along by my good
friend sam to talk a little bit about
the qa i do i'm part of
the core team on qa so our kind of
bread and butter is we sort of look at
the core gameplay loops so making sure
that the player works making sure that
when you're loading the game new
beverage is still there and we haven't
accidentally deleted it um and the
missions that sort of stuff really all
the basics
all right
and last but certainly not least uh an
oh an old hand here it starts in this
this gentleman and i i i gotta give him
crap for this
he he he he was here at cig around the
same time i started and then he got out
and then recently he came back he came
back george
george zero georgia original who are you
and what do you do for star citizen
i'm i'm george s i am a well i'm a new
qa tester on the gameplay team so
testing new gameplay features as they're
coming in i've just come out of sam's
amazing training as well a week ago so
just had my first
week back in the real world of q of qa
which is interesting to see how things
have developed and changed obviously
before three years ago almost the day i
was in qa and before that i was in
player relations so some of you may
recognize the name from there as well
yeah i think i'm still waiting for you
to answer one of my tickets actually
[Laughter]
just probably all right so
on today's show we're doing things a
little different like now on star
citizen live we usually have uh
designers artists engineers stuff like
this uh as we spoke of uh at the
beginning of last week's uh
inside star citizen because we are in
our quarter three
of the year and because that's the
citizencon
into iae corridor uh everybo everybody
is heads down working on their
presentations and stuff for for that
stuff uh it gives us the opportunity to
stretch our our proverbial and
metaphysical legs a little bit and
explore aspects of star citizen's
development that maybe we otherwise
wouldn't throughout the rest of the year
so
uh just like on isc where we took the
opportunity to delve into the production
life of of steph bedford and we're going
to jump into some other lives here in
the coming weeks there i wanted to take
this opportunity to jump behind the
scenes into a
an aspect of game development that's
near and dear to my heart which is
quality assurance
many of our
finest folks get their careers uh start
their careers rather in quality
assurance it's it's a it's a terrific
way to learn uh almost every aspect of
game development because there's there's
very little that goes into star citizen
or any video game that quality assurance
does not touch in some way shape or form
names you might recognize like ricky
jelly got their start in qa
phil from our audio team got a start in
qa
tyler wicken our director of community
got to start in qa and i'm not going to
go and list the list but it is a
terrific place to learn the industry
to learn
almost every aspect of game development
so with that
i want to turn things over to sam here
for for a little while uh sam you are
the resource lead yeah it is your job to
to
train these train these these these
people up and make sure that they can
jump into what is
what is a very dense and very a thick
game with a lot of tribal knowledge uh
uh where do we start with this process
yeah definitely so i mean when it comes
to star citizen it is absolutely massive
and
when you know you're looking for people
to hire you obviously want to try and
take on people who have a little bit of
qa knowledge to begin with
but recently we have been um
like reaching out beyond people who have
maybe that games experience already
um into
people who have you know a passion for
the project um for example quite a few
of our new starters did actually start
off as players of star citizen for
example i know uh george plays star
citizen as well um george stabler that
is um
so he started off from that
um and it's just really kind of
inspiring to take people through that
process of
knowing nothing about games to
kind of warming them up i guess and
getting them out of the
the myths and the kind of preconceptions
they might have around qa
to the point where you know they're
fully ready to get into the job and
test our massive
kind of universe basically
so
yeah when it comes to those kinds of um
i guess
myths and stuff um a lot of the people
who like i say don't have that game's
background
may kind of have some conceptions about
um
qa testers and what they do and that
kind of thing
so i guess we'll kind of touch on some
of those points um
so for starters yeah so let's job
let's start with the biggest myth buster
in the world qa just plays the game
i mean i would love to get paid to just
play the game that would be absolutely
wonderful
um but sadly it's not maybe quite as
appealing as that i mean there's the
video that goes around in the game
circles where there's the um
girl who comes in and kind of says hey
guys are you done testing that game i
need another one uh designed and they go
yeah just tighten up the graphics on
level three man i can't believe they pay
us to play games and
i guess that is kind of the the opinion
that a lot of people get uh because of
that um
but yes when it comes to actual qa i
think it's more
to do with being kind of like an
information broker for a developer
and just kind of making sure we know
exactly everything about the game uh
keeping a pulse on it as it goes from
the beginning uh for example you know
jack starts off with the most broken
kind of new
interesting stuff on the core team
those guys deal with all that kind of
thing
and then as it goes on to the more
finalized products um
you might see it through you know george
would kind of uh see that through to the
released product basically so as well as
getting to play the game which we we do
um repetitively but we do get to play
the game um
we we kind of are making sure we're
providing good detail to the developers
on on how to reproduce bugs
uh debug information for anything that
comes up
um prioritizing certain checks for
example if new features are coming in we
need to make sure that we are
rinsing those and maybe de-prioritizing
some of the older stuff
so yeah that's kind of a little bit more
about
the qa role do any of you guys have any
points on just playing the game what
what kind of things you do outside take
us through it take us through a typical
day if there is such a thing as a
typical day
describe the daily routine
here
do you want to one of you guys want to
take that one i mean yeah oh
no go oh okay i've landed on this one
and so like sam said i work on the uh
the core team which is kind of like we
check like the core um mechanics of the
game to make sure that when all the new
and exciting stuff comes in uh we
haven't accidentally
introduced a new variable that like
completely ruins the game somehow so i'm
kind of there on
the front lines almost of just making
sure that the game in its base form is
still playable so in core team we
usually
sort of have like a series of checks and
we'll like cycle through them so we'll
spend a couple of weeks making sure the
players working then we'll spend a
couple of weeks making sure that all the
different landing zones like corus and
um new babbage area 18 they're all still
working properly we might check missions
and we'll kind of go through all of
those and once we finish we just kind of
loop back around to the start and start
again
so a usual day for qas um i'll come in
uh the rest of my team have usually
already started because i enjoy a line
um and we'll sort of spin up our own
sort of like microcosm a little tiny
server that we just test with these six
or seven people we've got
and we have a big long list of hundreds
and hundreds of checks that are all
individually very basic so
it might be like you go into port olisar
and it's like are all the textures
correct is the atmosphere correct and
we'll just kind of systematically
go through all those checks for whatever
section of the game we're looking at for
that week
um and anything that's not wrong we'll
sit down write it out and then pass that
information up to the developers and
then it's kind of their job from there
to sort of
fix it now i want to follow up there you
say with the six or seven people that's
not the sum total of everybody in the q
a no
very specifically seven uh eight people
on my team
just looking at the uh core features
again there's lots of different teams
of people looking at other areas of the
game yeah and it's often important to
have multiple people because when you
because over the course of days weeks
months you're looking at the same assets
these same locations over and over again
and it's it's very easy to get
um i don't know if there's there's
probably a word for it but but just just
uh not colorblind but just yeah
snowblind i guess uh just you've looked
at the same thing so many times that
even if something's drastically
different this time it's not always
incredibly apparent because you just
you start to see the previous versions
every time you look at something yeah
okay uh
so
anybody else want to add to the typical
day before we move on to the next
um i'll add a little bit from the
network side as well so kind of similar
to jack as well but obviously because
i'm on the network team i'm just testing
you know network related things and like
persistent tech and stuff and one of the
caveats for me doing this was i have to
pick up the network team and how great
the network team are which you guys are
fantastic so hello if you're watching
clive johnson
yeah hello to clive if you're watching
um so my typical day you know i i'm
usually an early bird so i'm in it like
seven o'clock um if we're continuing
with a task that you know we've been set
beforehand we'll just crack on with that
um you know check things like emails and
messages like normal
and then usually around about 11 30
we'll have like a stand-up where the
team will get together and have like a
video meeting and say you know this is
what we're doing today um or what we've
done for this morning and this is what
we're now doing for the rest of the day
and if anything like major comes up
you know we can point that in a meeting
saying no we're testing this build but
we're having this blocker issue which is
preventing us from doing it so because
we talk to the devs directly you know it
gives us that more of a like a frontline
contact to say you know this is the
issue that's blocking us and then you
know we can go away get any evidence
that we need any videos
logs all that sort of stuff pass it on
and then we can basically continue with
our day um and then usually about four
o'clock i'm
heading off for the day
to address some of the comments that are
in the chat right now uh
as as we've mentioned several times
before in other shows
30ks are a kind of a blanket error it's
for anything that causes a disconnect
between you know the client and the
server and
it is the same
result but it can be caused by
dozens and dozens of different of
different sources so when when
when the very frustrating question
bubbles to the surface why haven't they
fixed the queue in the 30k it's actually
we fixed nearly a hundred of them it's
just that there are more it is a
catch-all it is a when the system cannot
be more specific
this is the error that it gives so it
often has many many many different
causes
um all right so
first
myth busted
qa players just play the game the next
one
uh
when when qa folks find bugs
they immediately get fixed
who wants to tackle this oh i wish oh
wow
and that touches on a bit of the things
that people are saying about in terms of
the 30ks and stuff as you know we
probably uh have
felt your pain um
thoroughly every day you know while
we're trying to test stuff as well
it is definitely a struggle but we like
i say like i mentioned for the last
point we are information brokers um we
deal the information but we don't get to
decide when
a developer has time to you know get in
and actually fix the problem so unless
it's something that is really severe and
a lot of people are seeing quite
consistently um it might be something
that people have to de-prioritize
um
qa do try and raise flags about severe
issues or things that we find
particularly frustrating gameplay issues
or you know particularly ugly art issues
all that kind of thing
but it is at the end of the day down to
the developers to find time to fix that
kind of stuff
um they also have to find time to create
new content and jam all of that in there
and somehow get that released out to you
guys honestly they do
incredible work to manage to get that
stuff done so yes unfortunately some of
the you know more pertinent smaller bugs
um may not get fixed for quite a long
time uh but
we commiserate and do please keep
sending them in to us we love to you
know try and
um
deal with the issues that the community
call out particularly
um and i mean george will have dealt
with some aspect of that with your old
job as well um didn't you with the
player relations stuff yeah yeah so one
of my bits and player relations was i
believe it's become become more of an
actual team now it was one of my jobs uh
was with chris danks back in the day we
used to whether there was a big patch
we'd collate all the major information
from the community like go into chat
look at the issue council everything and
find out what was annoying people most
and send the top 10 over to qa to have a
look through
and get bugged up or linked to bugs
which were already in and make sure
every the developers were actually aware
of the
the community's pet peeves they're the
worst ones affecting the people on the
ptu
you you you used a phrase uh
earlier show the information brokers
that i think is is a fantastic
assumation of of
one of the core tenets of being qa it's
it's a lot of folks will
a lot of the assumptions that we see
publicly are that if a bug makes it to
live and this is in any game no you know
we're talking in general here anything
from cyberpunk to
you know to full release to us who are
in alpha here
the idea that there's the assumption
that if a bug makes it the live it must
not have been seen or it must not have
been noticed or found and whatnot when
the reality is often that
these things have to be prioritized it's
like anything else like we say quite
often even with 700
staff working in five studios around the
world there are only so many things you
can be working on at any given time and
it is often a triage it is often a
triage of figuring out what the most uh
aggressive bugs what the most invasive
bugs are and then
just the ones that you can have
solutions for not everyone has not
everything that you encounter has a
solution that becomes readily apparent
and some things can't be fixed until
other systems come online or other tools
come online and it's you know it's
important you know it's it it's it's
it's it's super invasive and drives you
and everybody else crazy but it's like
the the tool that you need in order to
be able to address it won't be ready in
time so it's it's a it's a terrible
terrible
game of triage uh but one of the things
i want to make sure that we that we uh
uh
uh that we demystify here is that they
do not go out because they are not
discovered i'm sure that happens you
know sometimes occasionally but oh yeah
but uh it is it is it is just usually a
matter of triage it is it is i met you
you guys are you guys are having the
same reactions that the players do which
is like
yeah yeah definitely
we do
like my heart goes out to you guys
because we we feel it too but yeah like
jared says there are occasions where
there are things that slip through the
net um there are things that you know us
as a team
we have about a hundred um qa staff
across all of our studios um and it's
just it's not enough for a game of the
scale when you've got thousands of
people out there playing it so please do
you know keep telling us about your
stuff um
you never know it might be something
that we've missed along the way and we
would love to kind of hear about your
problems
or enough reports can help change the
priority the prior disease exactly
exactly that cannot understate the
importance of the issue council and
folks participation in it
yes absolutely and the new issue council
is absolutely fantastic um so yeah
definitely make the most of that and
use it because those uh player
experience guys are doing wonderful work
with it
all right so uh we're gonna we're gonna
move into uh our next section which is
about qa structure and how it works but
i want to do one more myth before we
before we move on to that
qa
are the enemies of developers
the
the the the antagonistic uh a
relationship between developers in qa
what do you have to say about that
not at all
yeah definitely not
when it comes to um
to devs and mqa obviously we are there
to kind of somewhat ruin their day and
we do come in and
you know sometimes they'll just be
something that they have not expected
that crops up um
but
the vast majority of the time i i think
we have a pretty good connection with
the devs i none of them have called me
names to my face um but yeah we work
very closely
um pretty much from the beginning of
when a
feature is being designed so for example
at the moment
in the run up to 315 we've got the um
healing and inventory changes that are
coming in
um we've been working really closely
with the active future team on that uh
guys like chris parry um
doing absolutely wonderful work and they
help guide us and we help guide them so
you know we we're all kind of striving
towards that same goal of having a good
quality product uh developers also test
their own work so you know it's not just
us that are coming around and saying hey
it's broken if they go through and
launch it up and something's broken they
also don't want that so
yes as much as it is kind of like a
tom and jerry cat and mouse kind of
a comedic relationship in theory um in
reality we do have quite a good bond
with those guys
which is really fun um and honestly qa
gets to touch on so many different areas
of gameplay that we do have like a close
connection with all of the devs say for
example you know artists may never get
the chance to work with a particular
area um just because of the nature of
their job
um so it's really great to kind of have
our tendrils in there and
george being like uh directly in the
network team
obviously if you didn't have a good
relationship with those guys that
wouldn't work so well i mean i'm hoping
this stuff's good
yeah and i started going very
[Laughter]
also we kind of know
potentially because we touch on
everything we potentially know a bit
more about other features than the devs
because they'll be very focused on what
they're doing there one little thing i
mean for example back when i was doing
ui stuff uh before when i was here
before there was an occasion where
literally they they did something and it
it
it impacted another system they hadn't
even considered
but the second we saw it we were aware
and we obviously fed that back so it
gives it so having that relationship
with the teams it gives you via
you've got the ability to give them them
knowledge sometimes they don't
necessarily
have access to because they're so
focused on their one little area that's
a good point it can be very easy for
developers to silo and and and and
tunnel vision down into the thing that
they're working and because the the qa
the qa is embedded and and kind of this
this viscous membrane that sits between
all the different departments and
whatever the the they're usually the
first the many times the first time
somebody goes you might want to check
with this
this team over here because what you're
doing is going to affect uh what they're
doing and stuff it it's really great and
i also when you were telling the story
just
i often
i often feel like the grim reaper
because whenever whenever i approach
this goes back more to when we were all
in the office anything but whenever i
would approach somebody's desk or
whatever that you know there would
always be this oh no jared's coming to
ask me to be in a video or something
jerry's asking me to be in his so so you
know very often i would approach and
then you'd see people like oh this is
the time to get up and use the bathroom
you know and go away and
it just just this is the first time i
realized that qa can sometimes uh
probably have the same effect like when
a qa person is going to say oh
which one of my systems is broken and
not working right now so
i can relate
[Music]
yeah
the embedded thing is i think is a good
transition into our next section which
is about cig structures
so many qa teams in
let's just put it this way
there there's not one way to make a
video game there's not one way to make a
video game every video game developer
out there every studio around the world
does things in their own way and
slightly different from one another
but many many folks
many companies will sequester their cue
their qa they'll be in a different
building altogether or on a different
floor and whatnot we take a different
approach here at cag and we
take the word embedded uh very seriously
we put our qa like right there in with
the teams at the same at the same row of
desks with the designers and the
programmers and everything that are
working on them uh talk to us about the
qa structure yeah absolutely so
like you say we do have those main kind
of qa teams like jack's team like
george's team that are the kind of
main gameplay uh focused qa guys and and
they run through together as like a team
of qa
granted they still do kind of contact um
developers and work with them on that
way
but they're more of a kind of qa team
so
um
we've got those main qa teams
um like those in the uh uk and also in
austin texas we have a few like um
testers who work as part of like main
teams like that
as well as the core and the gameplay
teams we also have a vehicles and fps
team which i led for a short amount of
time it was really fun to to kind of
delve into the ships and the shooters
kind of stuff basically
um and then we also have the tech team
who deal with everything editor-based so
all of the kind of
tools that our developers use that also
need to work um so not just the game
playing aspect of things also the game
making aspect of testing too
um but yes
like george here we have
multiple um embedded testers who
basically
are part of their teams
directly so george is part of the
network team we have people in the ui
team audio team
and basically they get to be
the person who is the point of contact
who knows everything about that
particular area when it comes to qa we
are generalists we try and do our best
to provide info across
the entire game uh but obviously you
know we can't remember everything
there's a lot of stuff um in terms of
logging debug
um i can't even get started on crashes
there's so much with crashes we have a
crash guide that is literally an hour
read on its own um just all different
sections
so yeah it can get quite complex
and having those embedded guys who are
literally there to
know the exact ins and outs of literally
how to develop everything to do with
that particular team is so so useful
for general qa for the developers
themselves uh it is a really really good
kind of symbiotic relationship i guess
that we have going on i mean george do
you want to talk a little bit about your
transition over to embedded
yeah so it was kind of like a weird
culture shock in a way and so before
joining games i've went to like retail
for almost 10 years and did my like
degree and then started in qa
and moved for like a few different
departments so before i was on like live
release so what game play is now so we
you know good test like the features
before they go live um then i moved on
to the core team which jack is on now
and then i moved over to tech and then
then i moved over to the resource team
with sam for a good like couple of
months and then i ended up moving on to
the embedded team um so it's quite weird
of a culture shock because the first
thing that i thought would go into an
embedded team was like you know i need
to make sure everything's good so you
know if i see a texture bug i need to
like bug it up which you know that is
the promise but usually when you're in
embedded thing you just focus on the
stuff that your team does because that's
why you're there um
you know you're running around trying to
fix all of these things like bug all of
these things up and it's like no just
take a minute calm down fix your network
stuff bug your network stuff up and then
relay that to the devs um
and that's the kind of the way the team
works i think the biggest thing is that
when you're like a generalist qa is that
you know you're not really talking to
debs like on a day-to-day basis really
because you're more like relating to
your seniors or your leads
um whereas you know going on to an
embedded team you know you're talking to
you know your lead who's obviously an
engineer developer and plus like your
seniors and the junior programmers and
all that like on a day-to-day basis um
and when sam was saying before you know
it's like a catch-22 so when people say
you know oh you know qa or dennis must
hate qa because you know they're always
finding these bugs you know can't they
just stop so we can do other things but
at the end of the day it goes hand in
hand so you know i'll go to like my lead
or my senior and be like oh you know i'm
not too sure how to use this specific
tool or command or something and it'll
come back at me but oh you know it does
this it means xyz um and kind of the
same vice versa as well so you know if
dev is in game and they're not too short
like a specific thing because you know a
lot of the things in game do change
quite rapidly as well because because
the game is huge and then it comes to
somebody you know i'm not sure how i do
xyz so then we'd go and help them do
what they need to do in order to check
their fixes have taken basically
yeah anybody else
you want to add anything
but i think we kind of
somewhat touched on the the aspects of
it from the uh the day-to-day stuff but
yeah like george says it's kind of the
different dynamics of we have like qa
teams and then we have our embedded guys
um
and then we have like the squadron team
which is kind of a hybrid between
embedded and also being its own kind of
small team of qa
which uh those guys did great work as
well right so so the structure and the
format is malleable depending on the
needs of that particular aspect of game
development
definitely
uh let's talk a little bit about the
the relationship to the rest of the
developers uh you guys are up
you guys are sometimes you guys are
sometimes asked to do more than just
test like like we talked about that at
the top of the show sam you must you
most famously flew the the character in
the uh the jump point demo at citizencon
two years ago uh
what what are these what are these other
aspects of your job besides just testing
and writing up bugs
yeah
so yeah obviously the the most obvious
one i can point to is the stuff like
where we get to be involved in the
citizencon uh playthroughs that kind of
thing is super fun i know george did
some work on the um testing for the
citizencon stuff as well
um but yeah being able to like perform
that live and kind of do that in front
of a crowd is a little bit of a
different skill than my day-to-day kind
of
just me and the two monitors kind of
testing um
very nerve-wracking uh but super fun
um so yeah we we do things like that we
do uh game playing for marketing footage
as well so say for example if they've
got a particular feature they want to
highlight um sometimes we'll get key way
to do particular maneuvers or capture
particular footage and game
um
but yeah live playthroughs and stuff
like i said on the stage or we sometimes
do recorded playthroughs of things as
well uh four citizencon we play
sometimes during review meetings so say
for example they're reviewing a future
for the directors kind of want to see
how a particular
aspect of gameplay is going um in terms
of
in-client how is it actually looking um
will sometimes get involved with those
so that can be a bit nerve-wracking as
well um
but probably doesn't quite match up to
you know sitting on stage with cr there
and todd just there
it cannot be overstated how much you
don't want developers playing their own
game uh
it's just it's we we've showcased it on
a couple the friday live streams in the
past and there's a reason we don't do it
anymore it's a let's just say the skill
set that is required to make a game
and the skill set that is required to
play a game
are are our if it were a venn diagram
there would be two separate circles
which always surprises people that when
they jump into game with the people who
make the game or whatever like why are
they so bad at their own game i'm like
different skill sets folks yeah
difference fully
especially the art kind of based stuff
uh those guys barely got just where they
were
good at playing the game
that transfer over
um yeah let's talk about working
alongside the community i think the last
pillar of cig structure here you've got
how you work with the devs and
and and stuff like this but let's talk
about working alongside the community uh
we famously have our issue council we we
we we take the extra step of deputizing
uh a a a giant chunk of our community in
order to uh help us and inform us and uh
help with regression and stuff like this
uh talk to me about that what's that
like does that make your job easier does
it make your job harder
please say it's easy
it definitely doesn't make it harder now
um
i mean it maybe it gives us a little bit
more work to do but there's always
plenty of work to do with star citizen
so that's totally fine now uh we work
really closely with the player
experience guys um to kind of
investigate those issues that come in
from issue council
like i said those top 10 issues do come
to us we do look into them we do make
sure they're updated on the database so
you can you know rest assured we are
definitely touching your bugs like we do
see them and we do appreciate all of the
kind of info that you can give us about
those particular issues especially if
it's something that's on and off um
sometimes having that stuff from the
issue council is the key to us finding
out exactly where to go and how to you
know provide the right debug um you know
if it's a particular
thing that we didn't think along the way
a step that we were missing um that's
super useful to have
um we also do outside of the issue
account stuff we do take things from the
community from the forums
if there are like feedback things that
we think are probably bugs we do pick up
those as well
um videos um you know for example on
youtube all of our content creators
there and streamers
we do get a lot of that content sent
through to us and kind of say hey uh
have you seen this happen is there a bug
for it help um and we'll usually trawl
through our database for that um so yeah
it's really kind of an interesting
position here at cig especially in
comparison to other qa roles i've done
in the industry where we are fully
tight-knit with the community um
because we are releasing constantly and
it's it's an experience i've just never
had before
when you're working on a project that is
going to be released and kind of shipped
off and
you know nobody else is looking at it it
gives you a whole other perspective um
and you know you're able to do those big
load testing of
thousands of people or you know 50
people to a server every single time um
which we don't often get to do in qa so
that's really really um
kind of
you know an experience i didn't expect
to have when i came to this job i guess
and has been really interesting it is
like having another crew of testers that
could basically help us sweep
everything that we need to do
i mean how have you guys found
interacting with the community um
i mean i know we've kind of touched on
it with george but
it's it's really really useful because i
know back
uh i keep saying back in the day
back in the day
there um
there was an issue we had uh levski
where occasionally everything would go
psychedelic colors and
we saw it
three four times in testing and we
couldn't repro it there's nothing we
could do it just happened
every so often and so we couldn't work
out what was causing it at all
and obviously it then went to the pt
went to the ptu to to be tested and and
actually because it gives you those
extra people throwing it and we could
see what was causing it and things and
passed that on
past that on
and it was it's so useful to have that
information to be able to feedback and
certainly in situations like that with
things which are
ultra low reproduction some chance of us
reproducing them in gen in in standard
testing are
it's just luck whether it's we get it
and we can reproduce the what caused it
or even work it out at the time
so we're talking about
you're right now we're talking about you
know the players the communities and how
they can help with the testing is there
any
i'm looking at the chat here are there
any uh
guidances advices that you can give the
community for when they're filling out
their
issue council reports thanks to to look
out for things to avoid
yeah
so i mean for starters things like video
footage and um screenshots obviously if
you can provide that kind of physical
evidence it makes it a lot easier for us
to kind of maybe
see things that perhaps you don't know
the particular word for um externally so
having those videos are really useful
um
particularly mentioning the types of
ships and the like variant of ship that
you are encountering an issue in can be
really useful to us actually um a lot of
bugs end up being you know specific to
certain manufacturers or certain types
of ships because of the way that they're
set up so if it is a ship's book maybe
going into detail about
the ship that you have whether you've
changed the loadout um for example if
you've changed any of your
settings so keybinds or um
graphics settings that kind of thing
um
really honestly the more info you can
provide
the better basically do you guys have
any other suggestions for things that
people could provide
not really i don't think i've ever seen
an issue council bug and gone oh no
they've given me too much information
please add less tr bugs like the more
you can give me the happier i am because
it gives me like
a much better starting point to try and
reproduce what you're seeing in game if
you've given me loads of information i
can just jump in game get to it straight
away and go like that it
i can still do that if you've given me
less information but it might take me a
bit longer yeah
so yeah the more information the better
really
don't don't think
don't think oh that's been there forever
they will they'll know about it because
we might not it might be something which
has been missed and missed and missed
and if you raise it
we'll then go look and check and we
might even go oh that's gotta be and
it's it's it's been like that for that's
something which has been there for ages
and then we'll go search and we won't
find it so even if you think we must
know
let us know about it
or it could be something that was
de-prioritized and every time it happens
and that can help to
up the prioritization of it so you know
so so just because you see it already
just because you think oh they must
already know about it already does not
stop submit that submit that submit that
it helps in a number of ways
exactly
let's go to our our our our third pillar
today's show here we've talked about you
know general myth busting of q and a
we've talked about the structure of q
and q a q and a of qa and how they work
within cig
sam you are the resource lead yeah your
your unique uh attendants are
are maybe best served for training stuff
we've actually had several people in the
chat to today already talk about you
know can you take us through some of the
training uh some of the resources now
obviously
training for qa we've only got 20
minutes left in the show we're not going
to be able to do the full thing but but
but give us a high level what is what is
what is training for qa involved because
it is often an entry-level uh position
for game development yeah absolutely and
like i say we've been taking on a few
people that are coming from the
community who don't have any experience
or education in games it can help
obviously if you have that kind of
background but even i coming from a
place where i had qa experience learning
star citizen was kind of its own uh
mountain to climb so
it is kind of
um
something that we we thought about in
the qa department and we wanted to kind
of prioritize
making sure that the people coming
through
knew the game knew what they were doing
and were able to kind of get into work
and test the project quickly i guess
so yeah
when it comes to a project like ours
with the longevity of the project it is
super worth it to invest a good amount
of time into fully training our people
from scratch
um
and yeah for just from our guys i mean
um jack
did kind of you had like a bit of
university games and indie background
before coming into qa didn't you yeah so
i did like um some game stuff at
university and i was in like a much
smaller company for people uh before i
got to star citizen
um and i think that does help um but i
would say it's like in no
way required
uh i don't think during training there
was any point where i was like oh i did
it at university so i'm
so much better than everybody else who
hasn't done it everybody was kind of
just there like
oh wow this is a lot of stuff to learn
here
thrown in the deep end and yeah you know
george h coming from retail uh george
hess was literally in the navy before
you came to uh cig so you know it really
you can come to this career
from pretty much anywhere as long as
you've got the passion for it and you
show us that you are willing to learn
then i i love to take new people who are
just you know passionate about star
citizen and i want to test it and make
sure it's good so when it comes to the
actuality of what we do with the
training uh we take all of our new
starters here on an 18-day crash course
through everything um star citizen
um for starters that first uh week is
kind of just game familiarization
obviously we do need to be able to play
the game so for those of us who maybe
haven't played star citizen before but
even those who have um it's good to get
some time to dedicately sit down with
each area kind of go through bit by bit
we start off with some game basics
being able to get your ship fly around
go from place to place then we go
through missions so all of the kind of
contracts that we have in game through
contract manager
mining which now is quite an in-depth
thing um in terms of you know we have
the ship mining ground vehicle mining
fps mining all that kind of different
stuff so we have a full day dedicated to
just kind of
getting those down um then we kind of
touch on our other areas as well like um
arena commander and star marine and
theaters war
so
i mean uh
you know that thing that we are working
on hehe um so yes we do touch on the
many game areas as well to make sure
that everybody's kind of up to date with
all of those
after we do that
[Laughter]
if you were at the citizencon that um i
kind of was on stage for you might have
got the chance to play theaters of war
there actually they had a really cool
setup room for that
yeah it's it's really good stuff and i'm
hoping that you guys can kind of play it
soon
but yes
after we've done all of the game playing
stuff we move on to the technical
aspects of things so that is all of our
test commands and
what we call kind of c-vars so allowing
us to kind of
get all of that debug information go
from place to place much faster um say
for example we have go-to commands that
allow us to zip from planet to planet
in an instant uh which saves us a lot of
time while testing as i'm sure you guys
are aware it takes a while to get from
planets planet naturally
um
how to run our internal builds like jack
was talking about before we do spin up
our own uh separate servers and kind of
run basically what we call development
builds which allow us to get a lot more
debug information development
information that you can't get on the
live servers
our internal editor as well we do touch
over some basics for that even though
most of our testers don't usually um
dabble too much in editor we do kind of
give them a little bit of basics around
how to actually set that up um
[Music]
and then we start to move on to things
like
say for example qa basics
uh writing books uh what kind of
evidence that you need to provide for
certain books and what kind of rules you
need to follow while writing books
searching for books
uh testing
like existing books that kind of thing
and then lastly uh we do crashes which
yeah it does take a little while to kind
of go through all of those um yes
while you guys are well acquainted with
the 30k they do come in many different
flavors um internally and because of
that we kind of have to know how to deal
with each one um
which can take a little while but once
you've kind of got wrapped your head
around the basics um i would say that's
probably one of the most technical and
difficult things that we have to do in
qa so once you've got that down
you're pretty much on your way
how has work from home
changed this process
yeah so i mean since we have started
working from home
literally
all of these guys have kind of come in
during the working from home um time i i
literally have never seen any of these
guys in office which is a crazy thought
to think about now um it's strange
my brain kind of places people in the
office as if they were there the whole
time everything's very flat
yeah
i have no idea what height they are i
just kind of guess um
yeah it's it's been a huge challenge to
kind of
adapt everything to working from home
but honestly through
doing voice chats each day um kind of
just while we're working we'll kind of
use voice chats to each other it kind of
almost feels like being in the office
these days and it's really useful for me
um to be able to like screen share while
i'm walking through particular things i
do miss the aspect of being able to kind
of lean over and help kind of guide
someone directly but you know we we do
our best and
you know the wonders of technology have
kind of allowed us to do a lot i mean
how was it for you guys starting a new
job while working from home
it was actually it's really good it was
really really well done it was a bit
weird on the first day but it was so
it was so it so smooth so
so just basically straight into it it
didn't really feel
any different from starting a job
anywhere else it sounds daft it
which is good
that's good how about you jack
um it's
it's been an interesting experience um
it's it's been very different that there
are times in training um and even like
after you finish your training because
18 days sounds like a lifetime of
training you've barely scratched the
surface um
there are times
when you're new and you're unsure about
things that it is
a little a little bit anxious a little
bit stressful not having a person in the
room with you to kind of like if it all
goes horribly wrong just like jump in
and like fix it for you do have to be
like
a little bit independent and kind of
work with
people kind of talking in your ear like
okay
i know it sounds terrible but it's not
actually that bad we've seen this before
it's fine what you need to do is this
this and this
i think during the training period that
is a consideration but
you kind of you work through it um
and
i hope it's all worked out no one's
fired me yet so i must be doing
something okay
he's doing pretty okay
i guess
jijin in the chat says it weirdly
doesn't feel live to me is the show live
no
i pre-recorded this it's not live yeah
we pre-recorded this in the second three
weeks here on the live chat now just
means that you have no free will and
that you were pre-destined to be here
and chat today and ask this question
with that we've got a couple minutes
left uh let's uh let's let's jump into
some uh of the chat questions um how
much automated regression testing are
you able to implement uh
versus inefficient and messy manual
testing ooh this person doesn't like the
manual testing so my biases show
yes your biases are showing
that that's totally fine i understand
yeah so actually i mean automating uh
testing for a project like this is is
quite challenging to say the least
um
as it stands we are moving slowly
towards being able to kind of um
automate certain test cases we do have a
guy who is embedded automation actually
and he is working slowly towards making
it more available to all of us but we do
have a couple of things that we use
internally already i know george on your
time on the tech team
you might have touched on some of this
stuff with test runner
yeah that's correct so test runner would
you know it would grab a build and you
know run through like basic sanity
checks it doesn't go too in-depth
because obviously when you be obviously
making an internal development building
and run it through test run it can take
a few hours to do that so it goes
through the basic checks and and
obviously when we try and grab a build
it'll give us all the information so you
know this was fine this was fine this
was fine but this was broken but
sometimes we can get around it because
it's not like a core thing that you know
would stop us from testing but there
have been cases you know we tried to
grab builds and you know it would just
break continuously um but that's where
test runner kind of picks that things up
so we can kind of identify that before
we go into game to say you know we need
to do this task but this build is broken
what do we do kind of thing and then
obviously it's usually just the devs
will go and fix it you know asap kick a
new build or we just like usually revert
back and then carry on the testing
yeah exactly it's mostly kind of launch
sanity checks and that kind of thing
yeah basically yeah very basic pass
fails at the moment but we are working
our way towards it and it is something
that we are very interested in so if you
are you know an authority on automated
testing you know please do come in we
would love to hear your opinions
um
what is your most valuable virtue in qa
and why is it patience there's a lot of
leading questions
i think jack can answer this the best to
be honest
you deal with the most crashes on your
team
the stream i work on is notorious for
being uh potentially the least stable
one in the game um
i think
the patience is obviously a big part of
it but i think the thing i've er used
the most since i moved on to the core
team is
my memory remembering things a lot of
issues
tend to maybe disappear and then come
back
and after a while you just kind of like
remember like the really bad ones so
something might appear that's been gone
for like three months and you can just
look and go oh i know exactly what that
is i've seen that before and you'll go
and you'll find and you'll link it back
up and you'll escalate with the devs and
go this has started happening again
what did you do please
please help
the other one i'd say is curiosity quite
a bit because you find which isn't quite
right and you pull the string and then
you find something else and then you
find something else and then you find
something else yes
i think that is a lot of what a lot of
people don't really understand about qa
sometimes is that you know there's one
thing and you think oh you know that's
fine it's an easy fix but then that will
branch off into 100
thousand different things that you know
that needs to be fixed so does that so
does that so does that before this main
thing can be fixed it branches off so
much game dev is so complex it's crazy
yeah
it's a
i really like that i don't think that
can be understated it's
the one thing we can't teach is that
curiosity that inquisitiveness that that
ability to you know not just see
something and go oh i know what that is
that's that and then leave it at that
move on it's looking under the hood and
pulling on that string the proverbial
string as you said and just watching the
entire sweater come coming down and then
knowing that you know the developer that
you're sitting next to the programmer is
like
you're just you're creating more and
more work for this person but it's like
you have to keep pulling you're just
kind of looking at them like i'm like
i'm sorry
i'm sorry
it doesn't work
so sorry
i got
paid for this i guess
uh all right uh we are just about done
uh the last question i see here from the
from the chat says uh what is your what
is your favorite aspect of working in qa
uh i don't want to be too
it's a little too uh
i i don't know it's a saccharine for me
so i want to ask what's your least
favorite aspect of working in qa and
then we'll do the favorite
because there's kind of everybody's got
something they wish were different
um
crashes are the main bug bear especially
you know you're working on a test you
get right to the end and the server's
gone you're like
absolute pain in my life
you're just trying to get something all
set up you've been with somebody else
multiple people you just set up to do
something get something tested and nope
yeah
yeah you you're managing to like kind of
hook up your thing you're about to like
catch the bug that you've been hunting
all day and then
the pop-up a completely unrelated
crash yep yeah completely something else
and you're like no i don't have time for
this that's not the one you wanted
you're not the crash i'm looking for i'm
looking for this one not you
oh yeah every time yeah i guess that
would probably be my least favorite
aspect
when when bugs kind of pop up in in the
search for other books and you just kind
of have to go not now
shh
the things i'll have to look into later
yeah
the good old
sticky note of
unloved books yep now we can now we can
do what's your favorite
oh
i would have to say the amount of things
that we learn we learn so much in qa
whether it's like a kind of like a parts
of like a dev kind of thing and just the
game and just like general how you know
how games are put together i mean i mean
i love learning things so that's what i
love about qa it's just you know being a
sponge of knowledge
for me it's it's there's a lot of
different things but the thing i think i
enjoy the most is stuff it's the people
it's such a a good vibrant group of
people who even when you're having the
horrible crashes you'll be you'll be
able to have a joke and have a laugh and
it's if it wasn't for a good group of
people i don't think you i don't think
you could i could do it so but it's such
a good group people
you're lucky we let you back in
[Laughter]
what about you jack
well should have gone before george
because i was to say the same sort of
thing i think um
especially on the game dev stream which
does
tend to have some minor issues with
stability
you do form a real sense of like
camaraderie with like the people around
you because it's not just you it's
having like a horrible time and you've
been trying to get into game for four
hours and you've not made it past the
main menu yet it's you and seven other
people who are also having a horrible
time and haven't made it past the main
menu yet
kind of oh friends for life forged in
that fire together i feel bad about
knowledge and everyone's like about
people
i do love everyone i work with by the
way that's too late josh you don't like
that please
i i understand george i am
and how about you sam
um yeah i guess as as well as being able
to kind of
do do the same things as those guys i
love learning stuff i love kind of
picking the brains of all the different
developers especially you know the big
brain people like the directors who just
know
so much about how to make everything
cutting edge um
it's difficult um i guess just generally
being able to work to support games is
something that i really kind of enjoy
when i came out of university i did an
animation degree and i
hated animation i came out of it i was
like never again never again in my life
but i knew i still wanted to kind of
support developers and i knew i wanted
to support games development and do that
kind of stuff because that is something
i'm so passionate about i didn't have a
clue what i wanted to do and
just kind of fell into qa by pure chance
um just because it was something that
was entry level and you know everybody
could kind of have a go at and
i ended up staying here um because i
love it so much so yeah i think it is
just something that really is an
interesting career and
um
really kind of
is is
a way to get your fingerprints on a game
um and kind of
put your influence on a game's
development um
you know without having to necessarily
be a creative or something along those
lines
and for those of you who are watching
either live on twitch or on youtube on
the replay if you're interested in
pursuing a career in quality assurance
you can check out the
cloudemperiumgames.com
jobs website we got studio we have six
studios around the world now we got la
we got austin we got manchester we got
darby or derby depending on how you
pronounce it we got frankfurt and we've
got our newest studio in montreal so
lots of opportunities there to join the
team and help make star citizen uh the
best damn
i was going to say space sun but it's so
much more at this point aiming to be so
much more at this point best damn video
game of all
time i'm gonna get crap for that
afterwards all right
sam
jack
george george i'm jared thank you so
much for joining us here on star citizen
live uh tune in for inside star citizen
next week we are taking a look at
hospitals
the new hospital and a new babbage in
oars in general the grim hex one which
is surprisingly cool and of course the
clinics that are coming along and well
as well as exploring
behind the scenes of the gold standard
work going on for the saber the gladius
and the retaliator first so stay tuned
to that and then we'll be back here next
friday with uh something i don't know
yet we'll figure it out uh take care
everybody
godspeed hi guys uh see you in the verse
thanks for watching everyone i've only
been doing this for like seven years i
should figure out how to end a show
sometimes i should figure out how to end
the show
you
