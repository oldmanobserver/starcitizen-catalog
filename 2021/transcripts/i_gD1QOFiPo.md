bringing capital ships into the
universe we knew that they would be a
focal point
for combat we didn't want a solo player
to be able to take
these ships on by themselves you want it
to be a coordinated group effort
and all these weapons coming together
all these new turrets behavior coming
together
and it all works as one unit
[Music]
we visit us out to create an event that
felt
like it came with the gravity of having
the capital ships in the scene
and also create a strategy around these
ships to kind of take them down as well
to achieve that goal of combat we took
the high level and then we had to
work on all the small pieces that add
together there was no one thing that
made fighting capital ships be possible
is a collaborative effort of
lots of little pieces the main thing i
wanted to do when we were
bringing in uh capital ships was ensure
that we didn't make the common mistake
that a lot of games do
and that's when you bring in something
big and new that you make it overpowered
it's about creating the balance of all
these things coming together where
there was several different aspects the
battle scene itself
things like improving the turret
behaviors so
not only did they attack fighters but
they attacked incoming missiles which
are
a huge threat to capital ships
turrets on a capital ship will try and
pick bombers
as their targets over dinky little
fighters because
the fighters aren't going to be nearly
as much of a threat we worked on
countermeasures to make them more
reliable and also
more engaging from both the defenders
point of view of launching them
and from the aggressive point of dealing
with them
we put a lot of effort into making sure
that we balance the weight count and
measured worked they wouldn't
spam them all the time you now have to
fire enough off to generate enough noise
to hide your ship
we needed all the components to work to
kind of bring a um
exina threat alive which was the big
capital ships we had the idris we have
to travel in the idris has
the big railgun underneath that needed
to
have its behavior adjusted so that it
always tried to be
nose on to larger targets and not just
to try and
use this railgun on a mustang it would
only pick it
for the larger ships the
javelin is different it wants to get
within the turret range of its target
whilst the idris is trying to get its
nose onto the target the javelin is
always trying to
keep its side against the larger targets
to deal with them
once we had that scene together it was
okay so how would we make this sound
good how do we make this look good
you know and how do we kind of match
those expectations that players have
with the balance that we implemented
and ended up looking really nice we have
these big capital ships just taking
chunks off each other
the big thing that changes with this is
how many players
are in the scene at the time it could
play drastically different if there's
only five of you or ten of you trying to
take the ship down
but then if some group decides to bring
in 30 players in their team
it will play drastically different it
sort of worked how we expected
we knew players would be trying to
hijack the things and was amazed by how
they
did it we put a few precautions in there
to try and prevent that but guys always
managed to find a way
hearing the players go oh you know i use
this weapon or i came in at this time i
use this ship
at this time and that's how we brought
it down and that's just really exciting
listening to those
streams so you know we are watching
there's definitely areas that we want to
improve on the ai is still
not where we want it to be in terms of
target selection it does a very good job
to a point but it can still get
overwhelmed at times
you know there's times where i was
watching people play and they would do
and
basically it was impossible to shoot the
dress down and i was like no
then and then it was good to figure out
why and then work some changes and then
sometimes it swing the other way where
you've got 30 people in the scene you
know trying to bring this ship down and
it'd
destroy itself in 30 seconds
and this is what's really good about
having a live environment at star
citizen is we get to do it as we go so
we get to
have the players involved and it
massively helps us as developers we can
put this out there on a saturday evening
we get
the players playing this and we'll get
the feedback in
and then we can look in the morning you
know and go
right now so what happened you know
let's have a review of this watching
you know the turrets shoot down
torpedoes watching the torpedoes just
smash into the side of these huge ships
and they just just take it
watching it all play out it's been
fantastic we want to take capital ship
fights further in the future there's
some weapon systems that those ships
aren't
using yet which is their their own
missile and torpedo systems
we want to provide further expanded
combat opportunities for these ships
both in terms of the players doing it
and their
threats back to you
capital ship combat may have brought
many different game systems into
development focus
but one long discussed technology was
essential to ensuring
these massive behemoths wouldn't be
taken down by players
mere moments after they arrived so let's
take a look at how
sdf shields came to be for the idris and
the javelin
before they're rolled out to all
spacecraft in the coming months
there's a lot of work that actually went
into getting us to the point where we
are now in terms of having
impact effects that are defined by the
science distance field
sdf shields were a huge part of the
whole suite needed to bring capital ship
combat
to fruition the mesh shaping tech is
something that i haven't seen in any
other game before
our previous shield technology is
getting quite old now and it had some
limitations
primarily on the setup side you had to
have duplicated data
to detect the hits and then that
displayed to a completely independent
bubble mesh which had no actual
relevance to gameplay is just purely
there for visuals
they're really limited in in terms of if
their wing breaks off
the mesh can't adapt to that with sdfs
they can
a big reason why we needed ustf shields
as well was because we needed to support
the new visual effects on the shields so
we could really communicate to the
player
the firepower and the impact that their
firepower had on the ships
because we changed the weapon balance a
lot of the weapons now
especially the size now sophia's offer
so much more firepower than they've
ever had in starters and that massively
changed the demands of the shields
and what it takes to take them down so
if you're shooting the ship
with a size one weapon you may only see
a small
little energy flare on the surface of
the shield but if you shoot it with a
size 10 cannon the impact may wrap
around
half of the ship in the old system it
was just it would glow blue
it would go blue and then it would go
when the shield was down you had no idea
whether you were
99 of the shield face or you had one
whereas with sdf shields
we've got a lot more flexibility now in
providing reads on that and you will see
that they transition through the colors
as it gets closer to coming down that
gives a huge gameplay
impact we have several
techniques how to displace and and sort
of have the sdf control individual
particles he started to look at using
mesh based particles being able to
actually splat the mesh particles into
the shape of the ship
and then on that mesh we can play
animated textures we had
what we call glue so there was like a
glue option to to essentially make
the that make that projection we could
kind of control where that actually is
offset from the ship and
we settled on the name glue and then we
also have a volumetric component
where it renders a volumetric shape
which ties all of these elements
together for the final effect we knew
quite early on that we were also going
to be able to use scientific skills for
other types of effects so
we needed a safer type of effect and i
thought that atmospheric entry was a
more safe effect
it was the first bit of tech to use the
sdf the
effects are colliding with the sdf and
it allows the fire and flames to
hug the surface of the ship more
realistically
and much tighter there's quite a few
things that we haven't done yet that we
know we want to do
all we've got at the moment is the
actual impact effects what we actually
need to do
in the future is actually have the
powering on and powering off states as
well
the initial release of sdf shields is
just for the idris and javelin and it's
only really for their detection of hits
and the displaying of hits
going forward we plan to roll this
shield tech out to the rest of the ships
and when we have most of the ships in a
pretty good
position we are going to start looking
at fleshing out the
various types of shields the style the
manufacturer
and the race so vanduul may have a
completely different looking shield
than the human shield a lot of the work
that we've done for the shield
stfx will just help us with our effects
in general there's loads of other ways
we can use sdfs there's loads of other
ways that we can use
lots of the individual elements that
came together to make the shield effects
we could just use them generically for
vfx in our game in general and that's
going to just give us that next level of
quality
and flexibility
so what we learned this week well we
learned how the most recent big step in
space combat came to be with the arrival
of capital ships like the idris and
alpha 3.12
that the javelin benefits from many of
those same technologies
during the brand new xenothread event
and that while sdf shields were a huge
part in making both of those things
possible
the next big step forward for combat is
when they come online for every other
spacecraft
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
[Music]
you
