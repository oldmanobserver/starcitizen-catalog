Hello everybody.
Welcome to another episode of Star
Citizen Live Game Dev
level FPS level design.
I used to have it on the I do have it on
the There is right there in the corner.
I should have just read it. I'm your
host Jared Huckaby. If you've never seen
Star Citizen Live before, it's where we
take about an hour at the end of our
week and we hang out with some of our
developers and we
talk shop. Sometimes we do round table
Q&As where we take questions from you
the backers and put them to our
developers. Other times we do our game
dev episodes, which is what we're doing
this week where we we basically explore
somebody's process. We see how they
work. We
we see what it is they actually do and
you can still ask questions during the
process.
We're also They're also usually
accompanied by a couple of their
co-workers who just you know, just poke
them throughout the hour while they're
while they're working and and and make
their life a
living hell for an hour and that's what
we're going to do this week. So, let me
let me let me introduce you to our
guests this week. We've got We got
members of our various level design
teams. We got folks from the landing
zone content team. We got folks from the
modular content teams. So, let's go
around the room and see who we have
today. We will start with our
demonstrator
right here to my left here. Antoine,
tell us who you are and what you do for
Star Citizen.
Hello. Yeah, my name is Antoine.
I've been working for Star Citizen for
two almost three years now. I started on
New Babbage so on landing zone and then
I I worked on Grim Hex as well and
currently I'm working on the homesteads.
Yeah.
Great.
I'm really enjoying showing the
homestead progress on ISC by the way.
Yeah, nice.
It's I It's I It's It's become an ISC
tradition for the last two quarters.
Let's
just continue counterclockwise.
Andreas, who are you and what do you do
for Star Citizen?
Well, my name is Andreas. I am the lead
level designer for Star Citizen
Persistent Universe. So,
been here a few times. Been with the
company for six years plus. So,
most likely the work of the team. I do
get my hands on some white boxing from
time to time like Area 18
which I worked on together with my
esteemed colleague here Manuel.
He was a very fresh
aspiring level designer back in those
days.
He has come very far.
What do you have to say about that,
Manuel?
Good old times actually. Yeah.
So, who are you? What do you do besides
Area 18?
Hey, I'm Manuel. I'm with the company
for almost three years now. Besides Area
18, I did a bit of rest stops. I did the
prison hub and
I'm currently working on Horizon.
Oh yeah, we we we showed you
You were on ISC most recently when we
explored the commercial platform for the
Horizon landing zone.
All right. So,
today's show is about exploring what
level design is, how level design works,
the the ideas and the considerations
that go into level design.
I think there's a lot of It's one of
those nebulous kind of professions where
where people equate level design with
the people who make all the art and then
the people who who who who who who who
create the the finished product of of of
of of of an area of an underground
facility or or space station or whatnot.
Um
But most of you what you do is in white
box and it's it's the early step like
Level design is about laying this
foundation that everybody else then you
know, builds upon. So, we're going to
explore that process. Antoine, I
understand that you are demonstrator
today. So, if you want to go ahead and
start your screen share,
we'll just jump right into it here.
All right. Can you guys see?
Yeah.
Now
Now floating in space, this looks like a
weird space station.
But what is it we're looking at
actually?
So, okay. So,
yeah, I'll I'll take it from the from
the start.
Basically,
what we're doing is the initial process
of of creating a location. So,
first of all, we get a pitch and we have
to create like a
a level design document that goes around
it where we do bit of research and we
detail what the location will be about.
And
from our side, we also have to do some
of
details like this ones well, research
like this one where we
try to just find interesting pictures on
how to create the layout.
It's a bit like what artists do with the
image references, but for us we're
looking at like the navigation and what
cool thing can can happen here and then
and and so on.
So, what I'm going to show today is I
want to take a an underground facility
and I would like to to connect it to one
of the cave that we have
that the new cave that we have like that
one big opening cave that we have and
then trying to make a connection between
those two like you could go down
into the underground facility and then
you have a section that opens up into
your cave and and so on, right?
So, from the modular aspect of it,
it's it's just one section
of it that I'll be creating. I won't
actually connect it to a cave, but it's
just to show you guys like the process
of like, hey, here we go. We start off
with some of the pictures to to explore
what like some of the ideas we could
bring into this location and you know, I
was thinking like here is like this open
space here and we have like maybe some
areas that you can go from the
underground facility to to this thing.
So, I saw like quite like this this
thing here where you can see some part
of the cave, but you still have like the
underground stuff that can open up to
you know, mix to this this in this
image.
So, this is what I've been looking on
the side.
Then usually we would detail all that
stuff
into a level design document. We will
get also the mission guide that would
tell us like what we would precisely be
doing in there, but we yeah, I will let
the other guys explain a bit more about
this when I start. Um
But yeah, so in here what I'm showing
you guys here is um
is an underground facility. So,
I took this because it's it's a
well-known place that everybody you
know, knows about and so it's quite easy
to expand from.
What I'll be doing is
I'll just
show you guys how
this place works in general.
We have like a hub. This is like the
modular
aspect of a location. We In in landing
zones, we create like very bespoke
layout, but in the modular aspect, we
have to think about you know, a hub
section that has multiple like
connectors that are very similar on
which we create these modules that can
snap to it and then we can use the
procedural tool to generate different
type of of areas.
And and so on. Um so, what I'm going to
do is to just like take out one of these
and then I will have a a few set of
white box elements on my side here. And
then I will start to construct
something. So,
as you know, in the universe we have
like bunch of sets that are that have
metrics
which is very important for us
that everything just goes with the right
metrics and and
whoops, I put a little
light over here. No, it's not working.
Um
And all these are like preset things
that we can use to create a location
where we would know that this will be
the right the right metrics the the
right you know, it would be the the
right the right space for us to use
basically.
So,
yeah, I can start and
you guys can speak on top.
Sure. Yeah, I mean just as a small note,
we do have a few more pieces to build
our locations than five that Antoine is
going to show there. So, we have seven.
No, we have quite a few.
Um
Going back to like what Jared said in
the beginning, I think one of the
reasons why people sometimes are a bit
maybe not so aware of what level
designers actually do is that to my
knowledge, depending on which company
you actually work in, a level designer
does slightly different things.
In certain companies, they are more like
scripters. In other companies, they are
more
block out people, right?
So,
in generally here at here at
Cloud Imperium Games, you will say a
level designer is is a person who's part
of the process from the beginning to the
very end, right? He is part part of
the story when like Antoine said, we get
the the kickoff and the narrative. We
put together the level design document
that
is a fairly extensive document that
contains all the information that is
required for
a location to be considered fully
functional.
Um
These documents are usually written by
the level designer and then I review
them and sign them off.
And after that's been signed off, we go
into a white box phase, which is
what we're seeing here. Part of the
level design document is also doing what
Antoine did, which is gathering
reference images and just getting an
idea of what we want to aim for, right?
But then we move into the white box
phase and that is that is the creative
bit, right? There is in general two
parts
to level design. There's the creative
bit bit which is uh
blocking out the location, building it,
and then there's the slightly more
boring stronger tedious bit, which is
the markup and that is
setting up all the volumes, everything
that defines atmosphere in a space and
determines if it has a gravity or
whatever it might be, right? I'm sure
everyone at some point went through a
doorway in Star Citizen and suddenly you
start suffocating for some reason and
that's just some level designer missed
room system and he gets a big slap. So,
but yeah.
Yeah, the same goes also to
uh systems like
the elevators, the trains, restricted
areas, ATC, landing services, like
there's lots of things and that come
come afterwards. Um so
I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of
markup that we do in locations when
taking two of them is the room system
and the transit system and they are
quite
there's quite a few components to them
if you put it that way. So many times
the setup can be done completely correct
from our side and it might break for
some other reason. It could be
you know
object container streaming or whatever
it might be that causes it or it might
be that there is some conflict with the
layers or there's a million things that
can go wrong. So
I think a lot of people who are outside
of kind of level side don't quite
realize the complexity of certain
things. Um No, no, you already said it
was your fault. You can't take it back.
Yeah, but that's because we are noble
and humble.
So um what I'm I'm doing now is um
basically I I have like um the start of
a a corridor that then expands to to the
cave system uh that I want. So to just
represent like these big cave openings
like I I just took like one of these
uh cave um
little brush that that I just found and
um I I kind of want to have this uh
squeezing effect here to just have that
that big reveal of like this cave after
it. So I was just trying to get like the
distance, you know, uh from here. Does
it look like natural? Does it feel
um
that realistic in some sort of way,
right? Like like would that be something
Is it too close? Like this this door
over here, is it too close and so on?
Like um these are things that we have to
take into account as well
and try to build our locations, just try
to make things that make sense and not
crazy things.
Yeah, I mean what Antoine is doing
there, right? It In the In the game we
mostly connectors we have that connects
two rooms together is this kind of
letterbox connector. It's a 12 by 4
meter connector.
Um like you see
that's the bigger opening there. And the
smaller kind of doorway has a 4 by 4
meter one, right?
There is there's a lot of things to to
level sign special when it comes to like
spatial awareness and shapes and forms,
right? Like if you would build
everything on a fairly large scale
you wouldn't necessarily create an
impressive level. You would just make
the player feel small, you know? So you
need this
you need this balance between smaller
spaces and larger spaces, right? If
everything is big then
just feel big, you just feel small,
right? And the same thing thing here,
right? We have these larger openings
that sometimes goes down into more
narrow
um passageway and then it brings the
player forward a little bit and then we
have another opening and a reveal where
you get this like oh thing, you know?
Um
Yeah, that's the difference between like
uh having a bespoke location where you
would actually like have like one thing
sitting in a connector and you have like
more control over like what like how the
layout and and everything in the
structure will be while um in the much
modular and procedural system um you
have to keep in mind that like what kind
of rooms um and how they connect to to
your spaces. So they have like all these
like 12 meter connectors and then um it
could just be an alcove that's like
placed next to it or you want to have
like just a transition piece that uh
leads into like a a bigger room and
sometimes you need to uh bring the
players a bit further out to uh to
provide more more space for uh the the
next rooms cuz like otherwise they they
might
um
bump into the the walls of the of the
hub for example. Um that this is a case
we had a lot in in the
restops actually.
Uh where we had to like bring the people
further out and then so the room has
enough space to expand and then not has
any overlapping or collision issues.
Now, I want to add here real quick that
we're working in white box here. The
purpose of what you're doing is is not
to make something that looks good. It's
to It's to build an experience, to lay
the foundation, the
the the the groundwork for then for
something that then environment artists
would come in and they would see these,
you know, 45° canted uh rock walls and
then they would sculpt something that
was, you know, more natural looking and
stuff. This is to You're trying to build
the first impression of an experience to
convey to, you know, other artists that
are going to come in.
With this um so basically if you're
looking at building a location that has
multiple steps, it has kind of the
initial prototype. If you need to do a
prototype, you maybe you're doing
something new. Maybe the first time
we're doing a cave, we just start with
prototype. You want to prototype the
spaces. We want to prototype the the
sizes of the passageway and any kind of
gameplay element that goes in there like
jumping puzzles.
Um and once we have all the prototypes
that we feel that we require, then we go
over into the white box phase, which is
usually driven by level design. And even
the white box phase itself has kind of
two stages. It has a very rough and
dirty
initial
um
section where you just really try things
out. You just throw things together.
It's things are overlapping and it looks
a bit shite, you know? That's just the
way it is.
But you just want to get the feeling of
what you want to achieve there. And then
you when you have what you kind of want
to achieve with that place, you go in
and kind of clean that up into a clean
white box, which is like a proper white
box where things kind of match up, you
know, where right now he's using
something we call the template tile
sets, which is a tile set
has loads loads of pieces. It has a pink
um material and a gray material. And if
you see something that is pink, that
usually means that there should be
another mesh that goes there to cover
it. So when you're actually in the room
and it's a finished white box, you will
only see gray. You won't see anything
pink, right?
And once we And also part of
the white box kind of stage is of course
the blockout, but it's also the first
pass on the markup placement of the the
AI, usables, any transit. So any
location should be fully playable even
even though it's rough and not polished,
but it should be fully playable in white
box.
And that is a requirement before we
actually reach something we call the
white box sign-off, right?
After the white box sign-off, we go into
gray box and that is where the
environment artists take over and they
look at what we have done.
They start making it very pretty.
They might come to us say like, "Uh
listen, this thing you built here, it is
costing us a lot of problems. Could we
please do something else there?" You
know, we go like, "Yeah" or no,
depending if it's like super crucial,
right?
Usually we reach compromises because
that's the
solution to any type of diplomatic
conflict. Um
And then they
It can also be the other way around,
right? So
the other way around, of course, of
course.
Yeah, if they take over and like build
something and they maybe get like a bit
overboard with that or like maybe it
doesn't turn out that well and then like
we we just like toss feedback back and
forth and then it's like, "Hey, it's
like how how it currently looks, it's
not doesn't work very well for
navigation or like for AI. Uh maybe we
can tweak something here and there." So
um more minor tweaks like not not major
stuff. Yeah.
So at the moment um I've been looking at
like basically from from the inside
here, we would be able to see that that
gigantic cave that opens in the back,
like the the line of sight, right? Um
And so
I I started to kind of like I have a
rough layout. I I I want to have a room
at the end of this and some kind of like
you know, um
whole like walkway on top of the the
cave over here
um that ends up into some some location,
some some kind of room at the end. Uh
but then I realized, hold on, cuz
if we're inside of here, that means
that, you know, it's it's kind of like
loading already everything. So I started
to to grab
this this big rock here and and try to
use it as like a big pillar to kind of
block the view from the inside uh so
that, you know, usually would be like
the trick we would use is maybe a like a
donut uh type of room where you have a
pillar in the middle and you have to go
around and that makes sure that what's
behind you is uh
is not being shown anymore. Um
But I mean for for this for this um
showcase, I think this is fine. All
right, so
you're dealing with two looks like
to me it looks like you're dealing with
two major considerations right now. One,
you you you're trying to build a reveal
for the player so that when they you
know, they they they see it, they see a
a hint, a sense of, "Oh, there's a cave
down there." And then they walk out. As
they walk out, you know, you you tighten
their field of view so that then it can
explode into this, you know, grand like,
"Oh" and have have a moment there for
the player. But you also have to
have performance considerations and when
is this stuff going to stream in? When
is this stuff, you know, when is you
know, this stuff all going to move into
memory and stuff and you don't want to
have to load the entire you know, cave
when they're still so far away.
Yeah, I mean most of the stuff is is
kind of
already loaded, so it's more about the
culling, I would say, but yeah,
absolutely. A lot of
a lot of locations that we have in the
game, you will notice that when when you
move into them, there's a dog leg or
something that just
brings you around the corner. Cuz let's
say that you have a long chain of rooms,
all the doors are lining up and like 20
players just each stand in one doorway
and create this like 2 kilometer tunnel
where you can see down, you know, it's
going to
bring everyone's performance down to
even lower levels, right? So
that would be an unfortunate thing.
That was could also be boring, so can
also create for more interesting ideas
and like
Exactly. I mean, if you look at a combat
space for example, it's
a straight corridor that just goes on
forever. That's not really interesting.
You want to have some bends. You want to
have some nooks and crannies, you know,
to take cover behind, you know, and
create this interesting, you know, you
line up there, you peek around the
corner, and then you move forward, you
know. It's not just a straight
um
yeah.
No one likes to explore this straight
tunnel, right?
Also, for for example, like this this
big
cave I got here, right? Um this is
really just to showcase the PRs, right?
We don't actually not be something we
would put in the game, but
you know, it's to get the point like,
"Oh, I need a big reveal here." Like, to
me, it doesn't really matter what that
big reveal would be at this stage,
but it's just to get the
It's easy to communicate like, "Oh,
that's that's a big thing that I need to
see when I come here." Needs to be
something huge.
Um yeah. I think that always happen if
you start scaling. I take the art and
and scale it so I
I we need it. But it's really just like
as Antoine said, it's
just for us to like give the impression
on on how the space feels and uh
also
show the artist like, "Hey, we imagine
like this is like the big cave, right?"
And and so like um as you all said in
the presence like I just took a bunch of
the art walls and just tried to build
the cave and then like the size how I
imagine it and then the artist goes in
later on and actually like he makes it
like look proper and and scale properly
and then everything like that. For me,
it's just like
uh to give the the space the right
feeling for me to work with and like for
the
playtesting and then it's like
they can come in and then they make they
make it pretty.
And there's a question in chat that's
interesting. When does
We we've seen a lot of a lot of concept
art for various locations.
Uh we we're just showing concept art for
the various hospitals in ISC yesterday.
When does concepting for locations
happen? Does it happen after you've
completed a white box so that the
artists know what general shape and form
that you're working with or does the
concept happen before this?
It depends. Um
you can have like mood concepts that
usually comes before that describes the
mood. For example, let's do like a flexi
planning zone. It could be like
Loreville, and they put down like dusty
plaza,
big high walls, you know, just gives you
a sensation of what the the impression
and feeling of location should be.
And then usually these mood concepts is
something that the level designer takes
and it starts to kind of put together
streets or whatever it might be that
kind of feels like it, right? Mhm. And
when you have like a layout that feels
all right, you have the street, you have
the whatever side alleyways, whatever it
might be,
then that can be sent back to concepts,
and they do an overpaint of that.
Basically, they paint over what Antoine
is doing here. For example, they would
take choose like a nice angle of this,
and they would just take an image and
they would start painting it over with
their amazing skills and making can
basically dressing it
uh with a paintbrush rather than having
an environment artist go in and dress
it, right? And then we get an idea of
what it would actually look like. And
these overpaints then also helps the
environment artist later on to know how
they will dress the location and also
identify what kind of pieces they would
need to build, right?
But that is one of the tricky things
about being a level designer as well is
that
it it looks easy sometimes, but
the ability to create spaces and shapes
that feel
that just feel good, that feels like
they belong together and it's a natural
kind of real environment. It is it is
quite tricky.
Um
Anyone can
download any kind of editor at the
moment and open it and try to put a room
together, and
I bet you on on your first attempt it's
going to be
interesting. I don't know. My first My
first Quake III map was excellent. I
don't know what you're talking about.
Well, not everyone is a legend like
yourself, so.
So,
uh another question from the chat.
Where did you get started with this? Did
Did you Did you start with like building
Legos? Was Was it Legos and then you're
like, "Hey, I'm Yeah, I like building
rooms and halls and connectors." Or or
was there a
a mod tool for a for a certain game?
How do you get into level design?
I I can start. Sure. Um
cuz I guess everybody has a different
background, right, on that?
Um yeah, for me, um I think it's it's
funny to say, but I think Minecraft
helped
really to get the sense of space and
scale and just like what what makes
sense, what feels cool to build, and so
on.
Um but then yeah, I I jumped into like
editors um
to uh
uh to try to build games out of these
editors and and also
you know, other game engine before
getting into the industry.
Uh just just building games and so on,
and I focus on level design. Like
building world and and
just thinking about the special aspect
of things is something that I liked.
So, uh
yeah.
That's for me.
Um on on on my end, um
when when when I was young, I played a
bit always like to play around with
level editors like World of Warcraft for
example.
Um but that was just more more on the
side, but when I was playing games like
the the Gothic or the Risen series, this
is when it actually like started in
getting me like interested in I I really
want to do this for a living because
um for level design, you actually like
you see what you're building
in in the editor in the game
um rather than in game design where you
do more like theoretical stuff and and
do a lot of like write-ups and and
things like that. So, I I it was always
more appealing to me
to
to build something in the editor and
have like freedom and
try to
abuse some of the assets or play around
and just like create a location and also
a bit of scripting and all that stuff.
Clench Eastwood says, "I've played
Minecraft. I'm a level designer."
I've played baseball. I'm not a baseball
player.
No, but then you have to take it, you
know, to the to the next level, too.
That's true. To be a professional is
just a
does does a lot of rules that and and so
on that goes on, right? Yeah. We're just
talking about
definitely helped in developing.
Sorry. Where did you get your start,
Manuel?
What was the thing that made you
want to do this?
Uh
Well, it's just the um
yeah, just all the logic of the special
aspect of it. Um
made it very appealing.
And when I realized I could do that, um
you know, as a job, learning all these
rules that and
that that's when I was like, "Oh, yeah,
I'm doing it."
Um
At the moment here, I'm uh
I think I kind of like have a layout
that I like. I just this room,
uh then
you know, it it it's just uh
I can get from here this like this
little section that tells me, "Hey, you
know, storytelling, we're going to get
into the rocky area."
Um and then there's a it's not just a
straight line. There's
a small path that goes on the side.
Uh goes down a little bit making it a
bit interesting. Then it gets to this
room.
I left like an area over here where
there's a door to kind of like
explain how maybe it just expand on this
side and and that is maybe the way that
you connect back to the cave system, you
know, that that could just be inside of
the big open area of the cave. And and
then you take like the side path and
then you you join like the bottom or I
don't know.
Um yeah.
So,
what I'm going to look at next is uh
probably some some purpose like some
placing down
populate a little bit of the space, um
place it down a bit of covers, and then
try maybe with some AI and see what what
comes up.
Did Did it go mode?
Oh, yeah.
Uh to quickly get back to your question,
Jared.
Um
So, yeah, after I knew what I want to
do,
I actually looked around how like how
can you get into the industry or into
the job, and
uh in Germany, they actually like have
um
schools for that.
Um at the time, it was just like I think
two.
So, I just applied there, and I took a
course in game design level design, and
then
once I was done, I
looked for jobs in the industry, and I
started working for
um
3D browser game, um and did some fantasy
types top-down level design.
Um
Yeah, in between, I also did a bit of
few years of QA, which which was also
quite interesting to see like
how
all the other departments and how
testing and everything works. Mhm. And
There's no better way to learn game
development than working in QA.
Yeah, exactly. It's quite a a different
point of view uh
from that. And yeah.
And at some point, I showed up at
Andreas' door.
And I
blessed him. Yeah. Yes, he said
instantly hired. Do it. Yes. I was last
week or the week before or something,
there was a big thing on social media
about whether QA were game developers.
And I'm like, if you look at the sheer
number of game developers that start
their career in QA, you'd have no
question about whether QA were
developers or not.
my opinion is QA is like
one of the most important departments in
a company. You don't want to release a
game that hasn't gone through QA, trust
me.
I mean,
it's going to be a
terrible ride. Yeah. No, I agree. Just
about imagine the most buggy game that
you ever played in your entire life.
That still went through QA, you know.
Imagine how bad it would be otherwise.
It also gives you like a different
perspective on like test testing your
own stuff and like thinking of of
situations or ways others might not.
Um and I think it like it
quite helps like having this this
experience.
No, it's absolutely impossible to
overstate how important QA is to the
game development process. I I just want
to point out Antoine is here working off
the grid. What's Swedish for that?
Yeah, I am.
What are you doing, Antoine?
I don't know.
this.
Yeah.
So, yeah, working on grid is very
important, guys. Um as you can see
um cuz this defines the metric of the
game.
Um yeah, no, but you see all my walls
are on grid, Andreas.
Mm.
Save this level afterwards mid round
probably.
Next year's review, he's going to bring
he's going to bring up this episode.
You guys had it lucky getting into
industry, though. I mean, with your
schools and stuff, that's pretty fancy.
How did you end up, Andreas?
I mean, my teenage years were before
even the internet, right? So, I mean
we didn't even have we had
computers. I mean, I I started
absolutely with, you know
I remember when I was like seven, I used
to love drawing top-down road networks.
No idea why.
I mean, I had like many A4 pages to all
lining up and just creating huge cities
top-down GTA 1 and 2 style, right?
But it was like this is back in
probably like '91.
'89, '88s, that's that period.
And then of course it came into Legos,
which is the only toy I had when I grew
up. I had nothing but Legos, only Lego.
It's the supreme toy.
The best of toys.
Yeah, I I I took a guess earlier. I'm
like there has to be there has to be
some Lego involved here somewhere. Oh,
yeah. Yeah. And then of course the
classic like going into D&D and
or
our Swedish version of D&D, Drakar och
Demoner, which is quite old.
Um and then being the dungeon master of
that, that was also fun. I always love
creating my own content, right? So. Do
you ever Do you ever still start with a
piece of paper and a pencil
when you're doing these?
Yeah, I do sometimes. I don't know about
these youngsters, but
Yeah, I I actually do that as well. Um
I try to think about like how I want to
build a place and some some layouts and
I I just do some rough sketches on
paper.
And then I try to convert them into
into editor and and see if that actually
like works.
So, I don't know. How is for you,
Antoine?
Uh depend I like to get my ideas done
right away like in 3D um
because I'm thinking about space
sometime I cannot convert it to paper
um big weird one.
Uh but it it depends. Sometimes like I
need a sketch before you know what I
will be building, but
yeah, it
it really depends on what the subject
is. Uh because the concept art can
inspire you sometime more than your own
drawing. So. Yeah, that's true.
That box is 3.183
m high. You're still This is terrible.
Let's
talk about how important metrics are.
Let's talk about metrics.
is metrics key, right? Um
what Antoine is showing here is is it's
not a a great
methodology of level assignment you work
off the grid, right? Like um
So, okay. So, what I'm trying to achieve
here is um to repro
this type of thing, right?
Uh this type of kitchen,
but within here. So, I in the first
place, if I would actually build all
like a whole kitchen on grid, uh it
would take me forever
cuz I'm not a 3D artist.
So, I'd rather have like these quick
things in there and in in you know, I I
I I I I I I I I the the only metric that
I would care about this point is the
1.25, which is the the cover height
um for AI and so on.
And so, uh at this stage
if you know, maybe I want to that this
wall is at least higher than 1.25. So,
if you combine 1.36 plus
0.9 something, then we get
Um but then yeah, I would then go back
in and iterate again and make like a
proper
um you know, as Andreas mentioned
actually Andreas mentioned, we go dirty
first
to get the point across.
have to show people how dirty it
actually is, you know.
We would clean that up later on.
I mean, there there's there's there's a
few metrics that is quite key here,
right? As Antoine mentioned, it's the 1.
um
1.25, which is the
cover height, right? And that is the
crouch cover. When you're crouching,
that is the height that you are
completely covered and you won't get
your head blown off, right?
The second
cover that I'm sorry, the second metric
that is important is the navigation
space, right? So,
yeah, we can do this first.
Yeah, this is the this is the markup
stuff that we're doing when we're
marking up the levels. Every place that
you have covers and stuff, there's is
someone who's manually going in and
placing an
an entity
that's connects to the nav mesh and kind
of
generates the cover for that section,
right? So. These are the things that
tell the AI that there's a place.
Exactly. I mean, Precisely. Yeah.
I was going to show like you see how now
it turns red if it's mine under 1.25 and
that's
that's why like I have to
to follow that that, you know, over
here. We actually should I can turn all
of them. There you go.
And that one is is good enough. This is
a room which even shows me like, okay,
that's like complete um full cover. Uh
cover. This one is like just a cover and
this one is not accepted or half cover.
Yeah.
Yeah, the second metric that is quite
important at this stage is the
navigation, right? So, AI needs 1.25 m
to navigate through a path without major
issues.
So, if you make a path that is 1.25
wide, then one AI can cross it, right?
Ideally, we try to make all our paths
2.5, which is double that, which means
two AI can cross each other without, you
know,
the very polite excuse me, sir. Yep, I'm
sorry.
You first, you know.
That kind of thing. Um
The
it can be tricky sometimes, especially
when you start putting props like boxes
for example in front of doorways like we
have here. That that's we have to go in
and kind of check that the space is
sufficient for AI to actually be able to
navigate.
Um
So, that is a second
metric that is quite important. Cover
and navigation.
Uh this is a few of the things that
Antoine was placing was as we as we
said, it's like this cover cover
entities and that's part of the markup
phase. There's a lot of the other types
of markup that we do.
Um like I said before, like the room
system that actually adds a breathable
atmosphere to the room.
I can show another one here like to be
able to vault
or to go on on top of a ledge.
Um
Also something that we want
we're doing to kind of control make sure
that, you know,
if you're not able to
um
I mean, if you shouldn't jump there,
then we're making sure you're you
cannot.
But we only allow it in some areas.
Yeah, I think we can even
um
determine if it's like should be usable
from both sides, right? And or only from
one side. So.
Yeah, in theory you could not stand like
on on a lower platform and then jump and
then here the the character would pull
up and and
pull himself over the ledge or the the
other way around you could jump down,
but you could also restrict it to like
be only one way.
So, for example, here you see a good
example of like level assignment where
let's imagine this is a combat area. You
have this little section where Antoine
was just in, right? You have boxes that
is
kind of facing towards the door. You
have people can be on the other side.
You have this little ledge on the left
side if you go
over there back into the corner over
there.
This is almost like a little survey
platform that leads down to the door,
you know, where you can overlook the
situation. You can have one person kind
of standing here providing cover while
another person goes in and clears the
room for example.
So, all these little things like this
that when we build stuff, we kind of do
it
on the fly almost because we've done it
so many times, but it's all about
creating a different in elevation, which
is always very interesting without
creating
um needlessly complicated paths.
And on top of that, combining that with
nice fire angles and cover positions.
So,
no matter if you're an attacker or
defender, you would ideally have some
advantage in certain part of the map,
right?
Now Now you're doing going with Chris,
Antoine, really?
I'm doing a four-burner stove. Yeah.
Just in that's important for the other
stuff.
part of level design. Um just another
right turn. This is
He's just showing that he knows how to
do a little bit of art. I mean,
you know, people
I mean, with this you be I mean, with
this we can theoretically just slap on a
material, right? And ship it, right? I
mean, I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
I I I I I I I I
I know an industrial kitchen was your
your your
your visual reference, but
I I got to think that with this
situation here, this is more likely a
drug lab or something being out here at
the end of a
It could be a geology lab, you know, I
mean, they need heat or some burners as
well to study samples of materials and
whatever might be right. Cook the rocks.
Cook the rocks. I don't know anything
about geology.
It's fascinating. Because yeah.
Another thing worth mentioning as well
like what Antoine is building there,
this entire section from here onwards,
that would be a separate module, right?
That would be built as an independent
thing and it can
be attached to
any of the connectors of the hub.
So.
Exactly. That's what what Antoine showed
in the beginning when he pulled out the
hub and you you saw like the four
different modules poking out that
this would be like one of those sections
and then you could like in theory move
it like on on each of the connectors
like on on a north, west, or east side,
for example, and like
um
ideally with with the modular content,
stuff should work in like any way it
it's connected and attached. Where did
your NPC run to? Oh, there is.
Oh, nice nice.
Yeah, I think they were all like uh
in
inside and use that cover inside. Yeah,
he lured he lured you in.
Just want to point out there's a small
gap between one of the boxes on the
higher platform.
Yeah, um I saw that.
That's what happened when you do sloppy
sloppy level design.
Yeah, you can also do that, right? And
uh
Yeah.
And then do something with them. Maybe
cook them in your drug lab.
I don't know.
Maybe.
The future, you know.
Please. Maybe expand our cuisine to
include other species.
That's just a small freeze on my side.
There you go, we're back.
Um yeah, so cover works. The AI is
moving around and so on. So, it's quite
nice. And uh
they are taking cover, so
that works well.
Um
maybe I need to check how far the
navigation is going. So, looks at looks
looks fine.
It's not going here, so maybe the AI is
not using these ones.
We try to rectify that. Wait, you didn't
you didn't do the navigation markup. How
is that just suddenly there?
Because
Yeah, because it it we already had one
with this one, so I kind of like cheated
here, but I will I will actually do one
um so you guys can see.
Yeah, navigation is it's a volume that
we put down and in this case it's just a
giant volume and then the system
generates everything inside the volumes.
It checks all the surfaces and generates
a valid nav mesh. Ideally, of course,
each room would have a more detailed
version.
Like what he's doing now.
But for testing it's just fine to put
down a giant box and
I kind of feel like
I want a ladder that you can climb on
top. Now that I've seen now that I saw
the nav mesh on top of the
on top of the kitchen, I kind of want a
ladder to get up there.
You want a ladder on top here?
Yeah. I'm sure Antoine can build a
little balcony on top there with a
ladder up, can't you, Antoine, for
Jared? Yeah, yeah, I can do that. There
was a question in the chat earlier
uh when you were
putting the bookshelves in there, you
actually like built the bookshelf, you
know, wall wall top top shelf shelf
shelf.
Uh first comment is bookshelves are is
there not a just a white box bookshelf
that you can just go plop there?
That that kind of goes into the
the thing where um
for us, we could just put a box. It's
kind of up to us to communicate that to
the artists like, "Hey, that would be a
storage area."
Um usually what I would do as well is to
have each of these labeled like kind of
like what I did with these
boxes here um
with like maybe color coding and then
just explain that or I would have a a
drawing of a layout
um
that we do in in in Visio or so on where
I would specially like, you know,
specify that, you know, that that's
these are storage area. Now
when the
um
when the concept art comes in, then they
would put that in or even just the
artists they would swap out, but I
thought that for the visual aspect of
it, we could just build a shelf.
Right. And even with even with this,
right? With the we use a software called
the designer designer solid tool, right?
Yeah. It's
we're quite proficient with it. So,
sometimes it takes longer for us to open
a library, find the bookshelf, Right.
and put it into a level than it's just
like drag drag a box, drag two more
boxes, extrude it, you know, it's it's
job's done, right? I mean
it's
it's just the way it is. Yeah, I I I
I I hear you. I get you.
Yeah, so that that you know, it looks
like a bookshelf at this moment because
it's just a couple things, but it could
be a cupboard, it could be a cat it
could be a cabinet, it could be a Yeah,
it's storage box.
When we put down stuff in a location, it
does like what Antoine did next to the
stairs that he put something looks like
a pipe. In the end that might turn into
a support column, you know. The only
thing we have indicated is that we want
to have something there that is a full
height of this size. I most likely it
will be some kind of full cover, you
know.
And then when the artists put it
together, they can really use their
creativity to
put whatever they would like to have in
it, right?
If there is something specific that we
want that we really want to have this
type of art piece there, let's say we
really do want to have a pipe there
because
we want to when there's combat that
someone shoots it and it bursts and gas
comes out, you know, then we will maybe
put a color on it and say like, "Listen,
this has to be a pipe, right?" And then
that's a pipe.
I'm building nonsense.
You're building Jared's balcony.
Exactly. With a little reclining chair.
It's it's just what I'm I said nonsense
because
it like
in reality this doesn't make sense,
right?
This is just for the sake of the show,
right?
I just want to precise it so that You
have an entire facility with a kitchen
outside in the cave. Don't talk to me
about what makes sense.
Yeah.
Precisely.
Vertical tra- traversal is great.
Oh, yeah, but we can we can even expand
more, right? We could have like some
venting system that goes back in here or
something. Um It could be that for
example, that door, let's say this door
that you have leading on the other way,
maybe that's the barracks and this is
actually their kind of common area. They
just have a very nice cave view.
With lots of cave bugs flying in there.
I Oh, I I I get it. Like like this is
like like uh
like like a build out of the underground
facility that hasn't quite been
completely constructed yet.
For example, maybe they're waiting for a
few more modular pieces to kind of put
together and put into the camera.
I do like the adherence of you know, the
safety rail and it's like this
underground facility that's got this
precarious
kitchen outside on this
random platform. They're like, "Nope,
safety first."
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Important.
As we said, it doesn't have to be like a
food kitchen, right? There's
there's many types of kitchens or not
even kitchens, places with storage and
some kind of heat element, right?
A lab of some kind.
Here you go.
See?
Oh, Jared created an interesting
vertical combat space.
Well done, Jared.
Nice.
I've played a video game or two. I have
a free slot on my level design team if
you want to join, just saying.
Yeah,
I I
Never mind, I was going to say something
then. I was
I I I keep a number of options open. Who
knows when my last day ends up here.
Never put all your hand grenades in the
same basket, right?
Um I can um
start on a building markup as well where
um basically we add like room system so
that you can breathe without your
helmet.
Yeah, I think that's a good thing. I
mean, show a bit markup so people know
the less less exciting creative bits of
of level design, right?
Although after the 404, I don't think
John Crew will ever let me on the
vehicle team.
They're overrated anyway.
Yeah, so with with with with the room
system now it's uh since we already have
an existing one
uh
I think Antoine can maybe turn on the
debug where he can actually
see them how it connects. Um
so, for now he's placing
uh
an area box down here. Um can also be a
shape. Whatever we need depends on like
how complex
complex the room is and then uh we
define it by the size
uh up until the walls.
And then we just connect an entity to it
and tell it like, "You are a room
system. You have like oxygen."
And we try to separate it
um in a in a logical way on how the
rooms are um
um are broken up.
Mhm. So, um for for um
for this room, for example, it would go
up until the door.
And then in the door would sit another
connector to a the next room system um
for the platform
and uh
we would put in a connector in between,
so actually the air can like circulate
between like
we can define it by the size of the room
or
doors, for example, come automatically
with with a a room connector in the
proper size and
um it will actually then tell tell the
game like how how the oxygen will
actually like circulate and flow.
Um should we ever get like
uh
according gameplay
related things in
Yes.
I mean, it is important as well as
someone else as well because the size
the the size of the volume actually
determines the amount of air and it is a
correct amount of air, right? That's why
the markup is important. Like if we make
a small room, it will only have if you
make a 4 cubic meter size room, that
room will only have 4 cubic meter of
air, so
that is what you have, you know.
So, that's why all this is important,
but also if you have a very large room
on one side, a very large room on the
other side, and a very tiny door in
between them.
The portal in between the two will
determine the rate of gas transfer
between the two rooms as well. So,
if one room is
a vacuum, the other one is full of
oxygen, you open the door, it's not that
it's just going to instantly equalize.
It's going to leak over at the rate that
is transferred through the portal,
right?
So.
Indeed. And
whenever one of the players notice that
areas without air exists, um
could have been sometimes appeared in
the area 18 hubs, for example, then
there was a broken connector
and all the air leaked out
into the void.
And then
left the room without air.
So, yeah, that's that's things that can
happen sometimes. A connector
just gets offset a bit or like something
was accidentally deleted or something
something just broke.
And then we need to go in and check like
is the is the markup like the box is the
is the right
does it have the right size? Does the
connector still sit?
Um yeah, and we have like lots of debug
options to
to debug that and and see that.
Yeah, in this case, for example, the
room here has a room and the
one he was just in also has a room.
The other bit that is still on the
outside between the two is
technically almost an exterior, right?
So, it wouldn't really have a markup
unless it's inside a cave.
We usually do a bit For For example, a
cave system does have a room system
markup, but it has a port at the
entrance that transfer the gases in and
out, right?
So, we're similar here. So, ideally,
because they don't have airlocks in this
place,
one would assume that there is a
somewhat breathable atmosphere in this
game.
Exactly.
Yes, I just put one over there.
Um and then leave it to the planet.
Um
and space over here.
So, that way you can
up a
set up a transit elevator now.
I But yeah, sure. No, that's takes a bit
more time.
I know.
But yeah, so we've got a
you know, a marked up
area with some AI,
some cover,
uh added to a UGF.
Yep. Very rough. Needs a couple of more
iterations, but uh
good job, Antoine.
Yeah, it seems tough.
You know, it's not perfect, but Well,
it's It's important to remember that in
these hour-long game dev SCLs, there's I
don't think there's a single aspect of
Star Citizen that can be made in an
hour.
So, you know, everybody that comes on to
do this is is is facing a virtually
impossible task, so
Another good thing is that he didn't
create any spaces where you can actually
fall off. So, his his security security
rating is is
a What What What about that?
That's why you you you you can't crawl
into that hole right there. You you
can't go prone. I'm sure you can go
prone and just like squeeze yourself in
like a worm, but
he can plug that between the stairs on
the left side. Show me what happens. Go
prone. There you go. Oh.
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh.
Maybe.
There you go.
Uh Need to Need to plug that hole, man.
You just went to secret level B here.
Um but yeah, as Indus mentioned like,
you know, we can see now um if I take
the hub again,
that that would be maybe a small section
and we basically just created one of one
of these again.
Um
and like what we have here, right? This
would be like
an entire section that we can swap out.
So, I could just take that whole section
and put it somewhere else where there is
like
um the same connector size.
You could then shuffle them around and
like have it like ordered in in a
different different spots.
I mean, at the moment as well, we have
very limited content with our UGFs, so
the plan in the future, of course, is to
revisit and really quite expand them and
turn them into their proper thing.
They're a bit lackluster at the moment.
They're
They have a few years on them. They need
a bit of polish, you know, a bit of
makeup, and they need
some parts actually need to be
completely redone. So, there will be a
one of the components that we'll be
looking at in the future at some point
will be a complete rework of the UGFs
and really
put them out with like a proper amount
of content, not just a hub and three
rooms, right? Because that's that's
underwhelming. The The UGFs did get a
new addition in 3.13, though. Nobody's
discovered them yet.
Dum dum dum.
So, I mean, the patches went out
yesterday, so
but there there is something
new to discover in
I think it's the medium ones. Might be
the large ones.
There's about nine of them. There's
about nine of them that have something
fun to discover.
And And Andreas is like, I have no idea
what he's talking about. I have no idea
what he's talking about, to be honest.
It's It's
I'm just trying to not show my
ignorance. They're in there. No.
I'm not saying what they are cuz I want
people to discover
collectibles of yourself. A A A
fluffy Jared laying around.
It's not actually far from the truth.
Oh, jeez. Okay.
Uh
All right. Uh so so yeah. So, we've got
just a couple minutes. What do we
How do you want to wrap this up?
Is there something you can do in like 3
minutes? What are you doing now? You
going crazy with the doors?
Yeah. I
I thought about expanding this into a
connector about the same size over there
we have over there.
And
then I realized
um that basically we have uh the
shaft over here.
So,
you know, in this case, then uh
yeah, the elevator shaft,
um which is a problem.
So, in this case, for example, if I make
it too big, uh we would have like
bounding boxes checks that would ensure
that nothing would collide
and one into the other uh stuff like
that. So, maybe that new section that I
have here could work over here,
but maybe it wouldn't work where I'm
building it right now.
Yeah, right. That's That's why I
mentioned that sometimes it helps if you
just like have a longer corridor that
like um brings out the whole space a bit
further and then allows for like
more generation options cuz otherwise
the procedural tool would tell you or
like, "Hey, that's like it would
collide, so it wouldn't wouldn't
generate." And then it tries for like
different combinations or different
slots where it could
connect this this new piece to um
yeah.
I mean, one of the kind of design
philosophies that I've been I've been
pushing for as well is that we really
want to get away from this
room corridor room corridor kind of
approach to building, you know, that's
not really what the world looks like,
you know, it's
it's a series of rooms or whatever it
is. It's It's more
it's a bit more structured than that.
So, you would never get that. But at
some points in the game you might use
corridors to
to what this guy's been saying, like to
kind of push some content a bit further
away
because otherwise we will run into
bounding boxes issues with all the items
that lies around it and things will just
never be able to generate, right?
So.
Yep.
Exactly.
But also when I'm Sorry. procedural tool
as well, we have the ability to
procedurally construct corridors. So,
the game when generating can make build
corridors by itself. Sorry, Manuel.
Please go.
No, it's fine.
Uh what I wanted to say is like uh not
necessarily dependent on
uh the procedural stuff, but
um
what what Antoine was like building
before like years like we sometimes
already planned for like future spaces
where things could connect on later on,
but like
uh for the initial release, it would
just like
