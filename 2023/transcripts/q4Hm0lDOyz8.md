meetings hands down the most exciting
element in all of game development now
everyone that has ever made a game will
tell you that it's gathering in a
meeting room and talking about stuff
that's really their very favorite part
of the process yes the best days in Game
Dev are the ones full of meetings and
the best behind the scenes content is
always incredibly meeting focused now
imagine a summit an entire week
dedicated to hashing out the plans for
the next month quarter year and
sometimes Beyond
yes exciting stuff I know
all kidding aside Summits are an
essential element of Game Dev we don't
often get to explore so when we heard
that the core technology Network and
engine teams were coming together to
discuss how best to move from persistent
entity streaming into tackling the
immense server meshing we figured you
might just indulge Us in trying
something a little different this week
so we set up some cameras and grabbed a
few willing participants just minutes
after completing their second day of
summits to get a candid unfiltered look
inside one of the most important Star
Citizen Summits of 2023 and let me tell
you January has been full of them so to
spare you the full effect of five days
of meetings we'll be spreading these out
over the next few weeks while continuing
our look at content being developed for
319 and Beyond so
after just a little Ado we present to
you the server meshing Strike Team
quarter one 2023 development Summit post
meeting review
name pending
do you need me to look into the camera
off the site right okay okay
um
yeah yeah there you go I didn't know
what you know
I can't I can't do this if they're
watching me and go
away
what are you guys doing here
uh well I'm visiting the uks who discuss
server meshing with the rest of the team
we're doing a summit to try and plan for
the next deliveries of pyro and Silver
Machine
so Summits in general especially this
one is really where all the teams
connect because you know with the
pandemic a lot of people have been
working from home so some has become
really important because it allows us to
reconnect together so we meet in one
location uh this time it's in the UK and
we have a representative of every team
so most of the leads and every team it's
the first time that we're meeting as a
team for a lot of us a lot of people
joined the company a lot of people join
those teams and they've never met so far
so it's just great like we have someone
from Korea Montreal have people from all
over you know so it's also a strong
aspect of the senates
this is a great opportunity for us this
is the first time ever we've had the
Strike Team all in one place all at one
time this is our kind of Avengers
assembled moment for Server meshing this
is the time we get three core teams
together to actually work out um the
final nuances of the architecture to
build this system there are many teams
are involved and to get the teams on the
same page yeah we're just building an
emblems in a room talk for one week
aligning all gods that we can just go
out and crank it to court without less
communication than we would have without
them many people already working
together for a long time so it's
communication easier if you know each
other and getting forward to yeah
equating on goals based on that we can
more efficiently execute two or two ago
because especially in a global company
where time zones uh it's kind of hard
sometimes I think about software
developments like oil tanker where it
once put into One Direction but as soon
as you want to change direction it takes
a long time because you need to get
everyone has a slightly different idea
of how stuff works and to get everyone
really understand how stuff should work
on a more detailed level there's a lot
of work and align it once everybody's
put their stuff in we plan it out we
discuss approaches strategies on how
we're going to intertwine our work and
this allows us to be on the same page so
that we can then work together to
achieve a very specific objective and
not just be building technology for fun
the objective of the Summit is to flesh
out the exact road map for Server
meshing based on all of the work we've
been doing before PES so PS is the state
of the simulation that's now persisting
that's great
behind us now we need to actually server
mesh the major goal of this Summit is to
reflect back on what we've done and see
how we can do it better for the next
Milestones on server machine what did we
forget what can we do better how can we
better organize ourselves
um
so we keep moving forward and we don't
do what we've had to do a lot for the
previous delivery which is
think and create as you go and there
will always be a little bit of this in
game development it's normal you need to
have this creativity you need to keep
that but we also need to get a little
bit better at planning and anticipating
some of the challenges the goal of the
me of the Summit is really to flesh out
the steps to get there with the
objective to ship a second solar system
that's really the primary objective what
do you call a jump point for you because
we are talking a lot of the low
technical yeah that's what I want to
know yeah
a secondary goal
is talking about goodbye secondary goal
would be talking about the low technical
groundwork for to enable features like
jump point
[Music]
so this is day two I think of the summit
so we've we've done a first
retrospective of all of the PES work
issues we've encountered problems we've
had things we want to avoid and this so
this is officially the first day of
actually digging into missions I know
the second thing
um day two uh we have drunk so much
coffee day two has been super great in
that we've we've aligned a lot of our
different roadmaps every you know every
team gets to have their own sort of view
on the project and I think today we
really came together as a
this is the critical path that we need
to achieve everything else is gravy but
we have the critical path is really
clearly identified which is a big deal
in the size of this project surf meshing
um
the plan for persistent anti-streaming
and surf mesh they were designed to be
done simultaneously at the same time
this is going back to late 2020
um we couldn't do that it just wasn't
practical in the end so we had to devote
all our attention to doing persistent
entity streaming
um this was in the club like during
lockdown so we did all of this while
we're all working from home uh we're now
in a position uh with the the surf
meshing stuff
um and I kind of lost my train of
thought I was going to say something
really good enough for growing worse
yeah we know what the critical bet is
which is the that's the most important
thing in these technology projects
because they get to be very large and so
sometimes you lose track of what the
actual executive is and our objective is
to get a second solar system online as
fast as possible not just to build
server meshing technology but it's to
get the second solar system online now
we have a rough road map of the
different steps we need to do to get our
second solar system online and so now we
start arguing about the
later steps and the strategies after
that we're tackling a lot of really
difficult problems at the moment server
meshing is one of the toughest problems
to solve in video to game development
and uh we've gone to the point now we're
getting to persistent entity streaming
uh to the point where it's shippable uh
that then kind of opens up lots of
opportunities to be able to get this
this quite impressive system built so
yeah this uh there's good stuff
Happening Here
so the first the first phase is the
separation out of the replication layer
that unlocks the Pyro jump gate stuff
that also unlocks the surf meshing stuff
uh we've been talking about the uh kind
of uh zones and Authority but you're
much better off talking to a proper
engineer about this kind of stuff uh but
yeah we're we're getting a good handle
on this stuff we're getting a good plan
for delivery
technology and now we need to build on
what we built there defining more sub
steps to go out to actually bring power
on the hands of the player this is a
really complicated system and we had to
learn how to do it we there's been a lot
of experimentation there's been a lot of
invention when we had our initial plan
at the beginning of uh 2021 and late
2020. there was a lot of stuff in there
that we knew we had to build but didn't
quite know how to build it when we
actually came to actually build those
interesting systems we had to kind of
re-found problems we found stuff that
was never expected we found limitations
to the technology we found limitations
of what the hardware could do so we very
much had to get our Engineers to invent
our way around the problem so this is
very much a feedback this is a learning
experience to figure out how we need to
build surf meshes the key thing that
we're doing with this is serve meshing
is also tied into the power the delivery
the jump gates to get to pyro
um it's not quite the same problem but
it also kind of is when you actually do
a jump to get to pyro where you have to
transfer Authority from the Stanton dgs
to the Pyro dgs um what we want to do of
course is have multiple dgs persist star
system but we're separating the actual
jump gate stuff from the actual uh surf
meshing stuff so that we get to the
point so we can actually assure pyros
delivery and whilst we worry about the
actual uh server meshing delivery so
we're actually yeah those are now from
our perspective two different problems
so very early on uh we're going to be
tackling uh what what we're calling
separation of the replication layer out
from the dgs so that's the thing which
replicates all our data it allows
communication it's a single source of
Truth in memory for this day of the
entire universe at any given time that's
going to get separated out from the dgs
that currently holds all the fun
simulation stuff that's happening at the
moment uh that will that's a first key
step both to delivering pyro all the
technical back end for the jump Gates
and it's also a kind of first big step
for Server meshing uh yeah so that's
what we're going to be tackling
initially
the design that we're putting in now
we've had for a couple of years and
we've been refining it over that time
and the time we're building building
persistent entity streaming there have
been bits and pieces of surf meshing on
there that we needed to get to get done
uh but we're now in a position now to go
really uh now we've got system entity
streaming down there as a kind of
foundational piece that then opens up
the opportunity to really kind of uh get
this design that we've had that we've
found
um to really buckle down and actually
get it uh dashed out and get the first
version out a static server machine like
this this is a piece of work that's
going to last for quite a long time
there'll be ongoing stuff for quite a
while
moving to the goalie even five six years
ago when Mr object container streaming
where we started to split up the game
into smaller chunks and then moving from
there having stuff only partial load on
the clients having stuff partially load
on the server and then decoupling the
persistent State and the next steps are
through this tablet more into more
logical units to execute the code which
actually server matching this though
gets really a continuation and over time
you the more you understand that's the
problem you're more you know what you
need to do so
um yeah that's why every year kind of
most likely we have a summit once per
year on this topic for the last 10 years
to
refine what we do and yeah what exactly
we need to do after we go to step Neo
that's the critical path to the first
step but after that is is how we get to
the actual end game which is the dynamic
mesh so we all have our views on this
but now it's really we're getting out
into the grave view like how is this
gonna work here's cases we have to deal
with like what if a player dies into a
jump Tunnel right what happens to the
missions right uh what happens to the
persistent state of these tunnels do
they exist do they not exist do they
respond so we talk about necessarily the
gameplay aspect of it like I'm I'm
giving you guys example now but really
the technology aspect of it so do these
zones keep existing how do we reuse them
do we want to reuse them uh what's the
effect on PES right for for this Zone
transition as subsystems so that's been
the highlight of it has been really
about identifying that and then how we
make it dynamic
the best thing which came out of today
is the same which comes again out of
summits it's to get alignment that
everyone gets the same idea into their
mind in a detailed level this is
after day two I think the biggest
question is still how we gonna how we're
gonna operationalize the dynamic mesh
and so uh you know we still have these
big statements like oh we're going to
request additional dgs's and then assign
them now we're gonna have to flesh out
how do we request them how do we know
they're ready how do we assign them how
does that actually work uh is going to
be the key to to the next steps that
will then be built over the coming
months and of course it's not just us as
well as the Strike Team we have uh what
50 or so game teams that are also going
to take this code and then have to adapt
their all their functionality that they
have across uh Star Citizen to use all
this cool technology so yeah this is the
start of server meshing in this curve
form in our case it's cramming a lot of
developers into a room uh closing the
doors getting to drink coffee and
talking a lot it's very much a list of
stuff that we've got to do determine we
basically have a list of stuff that we
need to nail down open questions
miscommunications between teams we need
to get these three key teams all aligned
all pointed in the same direction so
they're all fully understand where it is
they're building we resolve the
technical niggles that we have between
these teams so they really understand
what it is they're making we correct
problems before they happen so we
there's misunderstandings within the
interfaces between the teams that be
quite expensive to fix having a summit
like this allows us to fix these
problems in advance and fix them much
much easily so yeah we need to just uh
this is what gives us the solid plan
that we're going to be working to for
the next year so touchwood we're in a
position now to finally push on and get
the very first version which is static
server mesh in place we're about to find
other problems on this journey but we
can invent OA we know we can invent our
way around these problems so uh yeah we
may occasionally get slowed down but we
don't get uh we're still determined to
deliver this
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that PES is not just the
technical Harbinger we all knew it would
be it was also the critical experience
necessary to review amend and evolve
existing plans for server meshing with
the Lessons Learned along the way that
it has a variety of Technologies
including the long-awaited jump points
that will enable the addition of pyro
and star systems Beyond and that people
really
boy do they really love to just sit down
for an interview just five minutes after
sitting in intense all-day meetings
and let me tell you I owe some people
some dinners now we'll be back with more
traditional ISC features and return
visits to the meshing Strike Team Summit
in the coming weeks and don't forget to
keep your eyes on the robertspace
industries.com website and socials for
information on the pinning release of
alpha 318. it's got Salvage cargo
persistence and more and it seems
there's a new Scorpius
the things you'll learn on Twitter for
inside Star Citizen I'm Jared Huckabee
and we'll see you all here next week
