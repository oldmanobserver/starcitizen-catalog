California love that you're intending to
get and you'd always get some other
version of California Love it's like why
do I have the remix why do I you know
there's a version that focuses more on
Dre a version of focus is more On Tupac
it's like I just want the original that
I grew up with like is that so hard like
you know what I'm talking about yes yeah
I know what you're talking you know what
you're talking about James has no idea
hi everybody welcome to another exciting
edition of Star Citizen LIVE Game Dev
the improved new player experience I'm
your host Jared Huckabee and we're just
talking about the the discography of
Tupac
the joining us on the show this week are
senior members from our Star Citizen
development team we've got uh Star
Citizen live game director Mr Todd Pappy
hello
and uh lead game designer yeah
James K how you doing man
uh welcome to the show uh because this
is always somebody's first show let's do
some quick introductions besides what I
just did Todd who are you what do you do
for Star City uh I'm a game director on
Star Citizen so Tony and I are the code
game directors of it um but I watch over
more the player experience and and
basically what players are doing moment
to moment as well as content going into
the game
and James
um I am the lead content designer
um we focus I would say mostly our
missions but is there's all kinds of
curation going on um so it can be a
location set up Bluetooth mindable
distribution things like that so sandbox
experience as well as missions some
books yeah
so you take the the stuff all the tools
that are created by like mft and whatnot
and then put them together in different
exciting ways and then create that list
of requests like hey I really want to do
this but I don't have the module I need
to do this and it's like that so all
right cool we've had mft on the show a
bunch of times in the last couple months
so it's nice to get on the other side of
that and see how that works
um
Today's Show
is about uh one of the new features that
are coming in 319 uh the improved new
player experience
but before we get into that I want to
talk about
creating things for new players to begin
with
um Star Citizen is a notoriously
deep heavy game to try to try to get
into you know to try to just walk into
off the streets yeah the learning curve
the learning curve is huge it extends
even to our website you're trying to
have the time trying to figure you know
out what what you want to do shout out
to turbulent I'm going to get an email
letter from from Benoit on that uh but
uh they're doing great work uh
we have tried a tutorial before many
years ago
um talk to me about that first effort
well I mean basically obviously that one
was hand scripted from end to end and so
if any new feature came online anything
else that the player needed to learn
came online at that point in time it was
very difficult to separate things and
move them apart and then interject new
aspects of gameplay there so it really
fell to the Wayside you know as as we
were so heavy in development at that
time
um so it upkeeping that thing just
became too big of a task so we we let it
slide and we knew that we were going to
come back to it at a later point in time
it was also outside of the persistent
Universe it was in its own little pocket
Dimension you know based off the old
hanger module background yeah do you
remember what that old flow was
no
no I I I couldn't recite it off the top
of my head
there was gunny yes and there was a
magnificence a score from uh Pedro that
was very
um inspired by a popular uh uh uh aerial
dogfight combat movie that I'm not
legally allowed to acknowledge it was
inspired by and it was and it was it was
an experience you know getting in and
taking off and flying out but again
limited yes
strictly to the flight and takeoff
experience and it existed before the
persistent Universe yeah way before yeah
so so
[Music]
you meant you mentioned this I want to
touch on this before we get deep into
the new thing
developing a tutorial develop while
you're still making the game while
you're still adding stuff to the game
that seems crazy well I I think now
we're so far along like we we know what
our base hero mechanics are from a from
a player perspective we know what our
base mechanics are from a ship
perspective so I think right now is is
one of the best times to be doing it
um but you know in previous games and
everything like that first level and
last level we're always the ones that we
built um just because you understood you
know here's everything I need to teach
and then I can do it at that point in
time
um but since we have such a high
learning curve you know we decided all
right there's certain things in here
that
um we needed done first and uh we felt
once those were completed
um and really that to me was the
contextual controls and contextual hints
um those were the biggest things and and
everything was built around that thought
process and and what we wanted to teach
um and then from there we felt like we
can add on certain things later on and
uh have it be still a cohesive
experience but
um also at the same time uh
drip feed it a little bit better because
right you know I think getting in and
playing it and not having some of those
hints some of those controls that
because you know we use all the keyboard
and plus some
with all of our shift modifications and
everything like it's
um we wanted to make sure that the
players could always remember it oh you
know let's say they went away for two
weeks or three months or whatever and
then they come back to it it's like how
did I do this again so and so forth so
we wanted to kind of always have those
constant reminders there and then that's
really was the Catalyst for us you know
pushing forward on this so what were the
big so moving into that we've now we're
now getting ready to release our first
version of the new player experience it
won't be the last one as you said we'll
continue to iterate on it uh before as
we're starting on this process what were
the high level goals what did we know we
absolutely needed to what would like the
biggest ticket items like we've got to
help people with this we've got to help
people so for for from my standpoint
because I was the one who wrote the
initial doc
um it was really teaching the player
um very very core basic things so like
getting up moving around
um what are the basic controls for this
interactions
um you know eating drinking
um anything that will kill you you know
if you don't do it and then uh once you
start getting into other aspects as far
as what happens when you buy something
and we have a deeper thread there that
we haven't unlocked yet you know as far
as being able to go and use a weapon or
being able to go and try something out
or or being able to try and compare and
and all of those aspects that need to be
taught as well then there's the player
combat side from an FPS and then there's
the ship combat side so like us just
hitting very high level
high level things which was teaching you
you know interaction teaching you how to
um eat and drink teaching you how to
deal with inventory you know it we still
need to teach more on that teaching you
how to walk and Run and Jump and and
then being able to teach you how to get
out of you know the Spaceport and fly
your ship but still trying to Dole that
out and and kind of have some of those
repetitious experiences that sometimes
people need to to do to to actually
learn it properly
so we have a video we're gonna we're
gonna start here in a moment and do some
commentary over it but it's it starts
once you're already in the universe so I
want to start I want to go to even
before that so you've looked so the new
player has you know pledged for the game
they've downloaded the game and they've
started it up uh how do they does the
game automatically put them into the new
player experience does it give them an
option
so on the front end when you first load
boot the game up
um we ask the player do you want to um
do you want to
take part in the new player experience
if they do then we will set their start
location to area rating because that's
where the new player experience takes
place and then we will guide them
through the process just automatically
so as soon as they're in game the
mission is accepted and we will guide
them through as toddler saying all the
basics eating and drinking and we will
guide them through Area 18 onto the tram
over to the Spaceport into their ship
and then flying around so yeah it's uh
we we start right at the beginning cool
so let's go ahead and start our video
here so this starts this video starts
we've gone the the main menu we've
selected the tutorial uh let's go ahead
and put this on screen here so now we
are obviously about to wake up in our uh
where are we
Yep this is your Hub in in area 18. so
you spawn just as you would spawn
normally except in this case there's the
uh there's the tutorial running already
so Moby glass was another thing that we
thought we needed to teach so
um and also the other thing with this
room the idea is that you're locked in
this room like obviously with persistent
Universe there's not too many places
that you can actually lock a player into
space
um you know like a traditional tutorial
would be uh
let let's pause the game let's um you
know make it so that the player has to
push this button for it to continue and
so on and so forth so we have that here
you know in certain areas but once you
walk out of the hab
you're free you know and and trying to
teach that like it's it's it's very
difficult
yeah you don't have that it's like when
you ignore a GPS and it's like it's
telling you to turn right and you don't
turn right and it reroutes right we
don't have that yeah
not yet anyway
um so how did you well rather why did we
decide on our Corp well
um well the the thought process behind
it was
[Music]
um
basically we have two locations that in
order to get to you know our Central or
our shopping area you can walk directly
from uh the Habs to the shopping area
um and then you've got some that you
actually have to get onto the tram to so
um eritin and loreville are the only
ones that you can walk to the shopping
area other ones if you have to new
Babbage and Horizon you have to go to
um the the tram first so
um we wanted to
also just teach the player all right hey
this is clean and simple it it allows
you to go shopping
um and then also with the with cubby
blast this one made sense from an armor
and weapon perspective to to lead the
player there to that point this is my
first time watching this video I'll go
back this looks like like we're teaching
people to drink their Prime
the Prime energy drink here yeah I never
realized how much this bottle looks like
the prime
sorry I was watching WWE lately okay so
we're now outside of our Hab
and where are we being directed and
cleaning my glasses I can't read it
um so right now the players exited the
Hub and we're gonna send them down to
Kobe blast so they can they can get some
experience
um in a shop basically the main thing we
wanted to teach there was you don't talk
to the MPC behind the council are you
doing most games but you interact with
the kiosk so we're red chroming the
player
um down through the uh through the
elevator which will be the first time
that they've used an elevator so we
guide them to the little panel next to
the next to the elevator itself and
teach them to interact with that and
then when they get in should tell them
which Which floor that they need to go
to and as to be honest there's not
really they can't really go wrong at
this point because there is no other
exit than the elevator but you know it's
it's theoretically it's literally their
first time in game so it doesn't do any
harm to put a little little marker over
the elevator panels that hey
um you know on through the landing Zone
um basically the brand new team and and
the environment our team have gone
through and said okay oh yeah if you go
this way then you this is what you get
if you go to the left then you get you
know this other
um you know experience uh or shopping or
so and so forth so it it this is
something that we will roll out to every
major Landing Zone and then we'll also
figure out how we can do it in space
stations just so that you know it's very
very clear for the player to understand
where they can go and what they can do
yeah we're going to see more of this as
this goes on but I'm glad you shouted
Out The Branding team in their work the
signage change in our Corp is huge yeah
uh it's yeah when I first started adding
signs like okay I'll admit I kind of
dismissed it like you know you're going
to add some signs some directional
arrows here and there and seeing the
sheer amount that they've done and and
how effective each one is uh I was like
oh oh yeah okay like this we're coming
up on you know the first big obvious one
a brand new kind of overhead map to Area
18 here
yeah it I mean it took us a while to to
go through and work out obviously
um you know for every major Landing Zone
we want it to feel
uh unique to itself so for example
um you know an airport sign in Germany
is different than an airport signed in
the UK versus it's different in in the
US but it still has something to do with
their airplane you know
um same with food
um you know in Asia would be different
than than uh in Europe so there's
certain
um terminology and certain things that
we look at
um to basically say okay hey this is
this is something that we can carry
through but this will feel special for
our core versus all right when we do
loreville it'll be a different somewhat
different icon pass but it's got to fit
still in this this box so this is the
part where we've already forgotten what
we're here to do and we're rechecking
a shout out to Sam Molina who recorded
this for us earlier in the day
earlier in the week brother yeah Sam I'm
disappointed that you did not give the
person your hair or your beard
um you mentioned the works so we got to
come into cubby blast we got to talk to
the kiosk as opposed to the shopkeeper
that is obviously a that goes back to
the creating tutorials and experiences
for a game that's still in development
obviously we want folks to one day
eventually interact with the shopkeepers
that's what they're there for and stuff
like this but this is a good example of
something that you do an interim version
of this experience now and then you'll
have to continue to update well and and
even with this um so for example like
you go in and buy a weapon like we want
you to be able to go and test the weapon
so that you don't have buyer's remorse
you know all right I'm spending my hard
earned cash on this what am I actually
getting you know does this fit my play
style so it's that to me is is going
forward in the future like this is one
of the big things that was called out in
the original new user experience that
obviously hasn't made it to this one I
did notice that Sam is a dirty cheater
and he started his new account with a
million UEC so Sam expected better of
you
all right so it's it's this tryout I'll
follow up on this you're talking about
like giving cubby blast like a firing
range kind of thing whether it's a
firing range within its actual location
so it's it's like a
um
you know the player actually walks up to
it or via Sim pod or something so the
but the the the idea is for the player
to be able to go and and try out
um different uh
weapons different ships so and so forth
so like
um you know if you're buying a ship item
or or something oh I want to buy this
power plant versus this other power
plant like
you want to be able to go and test it
and see if it fits your playstyle was
there a prompt that told him to go into
his inventory and I missed it no not at
the moment
um some of the feedback we got was that
we should really be um at least telling
players that they might need a helmet
because
well yeah
to bring that up but I was just noticing
in that moment it's like that that
seemed to be Sam possessing some
knowledge already that yeah well you
know that I need to go to my inventory
to do this stuff yeah so right right now
we we encourage the player to buy a
helmet and maybe in a future iteration
um we can sort of incorporate that into
part of the flow
um but yeah Sam's got special knowledge
yeah I I think we've said this before
and I think we're going to reiterate it
a couple times like mining like Salvage
like any other gameplay feature this is
a the new player experience is something
that will continue to evolve and be
iterated on uh maybe not every single
patch but in subsequent patches yeah
you know not just for the new features
that come online but per feedback for
you you know stuff you know that's well
and
during
um a summit you know you know Chris and
myself and other directors we we had a
very long conversation in regards to you
know what will the final
you know nuclear experience look like
and you know the the Bare Bones aspect
that we're building here you know it
might be that we started started a
different place beside your Hab but
we're teaching you the same exact things
we're teaching you you know the very
Basics
um and then from there again we wanted
it to be kind of a a small bite-sized
you know gameplay and then unleash the
player into the world because again we
don't know what you're doing it could be
that that you're going through this
experience just to meet up with some
friends and
you know we don't want to keep you from
that so
um but we want to at least be able to if
the player needs to have their hand held
a little bit we can
we can help them out I want to I want to
shout out The Branding team again I'm
trying to remember
uh the name of the of the of the guy in
charge right now I can't Nick Forte Nick
and and Dominic also did a lot of this
as well another shout out to Nick and
domic just it's I mean this this is the
same hardcore being we our corpse been
around for a while RIT has been around
but I mean it is
it is transformed by these signs I don't
want to oversell it but it really does
look like it is so much better than it
was
well especially when you go to the other
Landing zones so this is something that
we know we need to take you know to the
other Landing zones and and
um basically Dole out throughout the
year and and going forward
so this window that's on the right the
the one that's kind of just
managing our what are those the the
objectives there on the right
I've got well those are friends
was that a new system with with the blue
bar at the top I don't remember seeing
that before
um yeah so previously hence would be
kind of at the bottom in the center
and we've got some tech which kind of
makes them
you know dresses them up a little bit
moves them up and to the right and just
below that we've got the new contact
contextual hint system
I noticed that when you open up the
Mobile Glass we had text on text
that's one of the things we need to fix
yeah we we know that um basically with
the old Moby glass it needs to burn in
hell and then with the the visor um you
know it's it's being worked on and being
adjusted hold on can we can we switch to
Todd's camera please yeah
what you think of it it needs to burn in
hell
very very deep hell
okay
let's go let's go ahead and go no don't
remember
so we're on the tram always a always a
cool experience your first time yeah
less so you're 100 or 200th time but
so we got we got some new tech
um that enables us to figure out when
the player gets on and off any kind of
Transit entity we didn't have that
before
so anytime they get in or outer of an
elevator or on and off tram we can we
can know where they are and what what uh
Transit entity they got off
um I think that's a good example of the
functionality that we got for the new
player experience that we can now use
throughout
throughout any kind of any Mission
activity in in the Pu
well and and I think one of the things
that needs to be talked about is is the
contextual controls and the amount of
work that a lot of the the code team did
you know is going through and adding
these hooks for everything every single
state and making sure that what's being
shown there is is as as appropriate as
possible at that time
um and that was a long experience and it
took a lot of work to go back and forth
between the designers and the team on
that so but basically you know it's it's
something that we felt
um you know was the core of the system
and and basically what's the the new
player experience was was all wrapped
around
and I want to address some of the folks
who are commenting on the frame rate uh
obviously there's a couple factors that
play one this is still a work in
progress build unlike any you know just
like any other this is pre-release
content
um there's a misconception that every
single member of the team has the most
powerful rigs in the universe they don't
uh you know especially you know
designers and content designers and live
designers stuff like that also you know
he's capturing at the same time he's
recording on the same machine and
running his own server and his own
running his own service so this is you
know it's it's one of those things we we
make do with what we got in order to
make the show possible but uh yeah your
experience will vary
playing on your own and not doing all
these other things so I I think this
needs to be talked about and if you want
to explain a little bit more Jameson
about the Partnerships yeah
um so for the new player experience
um we've basically gifted the player a
rented Pisces the reason we do that is
so they have a suitable ship to learning
we don't sort of completely lock them
out from any any purchase purchased
ships they get unlocked at the end of
the new player experience but for the
for the very first flight and if you
want to the the flights uh subsequent to
that the player's got a nice ship it's
easy to fly it's very small
so it's uh it's it's kind of suitable
for the very first experience
yeah
it's got a little sink preview of our
console there
all right so is there is there Hangar
three uh it's always saying or three
it's always it's really it's always
well it's whenever
um because I would go over to James's
desk and he'd he'd be getting it ready
um and so when I was doing reviews on it
and everything like that it's always
hanger three
I don't know why but but for this one
well he's running his own private server
there's no other player so correct but
but no matter what it's always hanger
three so if I was doing it in James's
desk even if we were we tried out
different ships in in the beginning it
was always hanger three but on live
servers it'll be whatever right yeah
and uh people like they don't know why
no that's what it's part of what happens
when you build a systemic Universe it's
You're Building all these individual
systems well it's I mean Hangar One and
Two could be like the oversized hangers
I I don't know how this one is exactly
you know set up so it might be that
those are the extra large hangers that
are sort of how do you have name that
every single game developer doesn't know
the work and content of every single
other game developer yes it's also I I
don't know how some of these stuff how I
know how it's hooked up from a technical
standpoint I don't know what order they
hooked it up in
right
just as long as it works and it is duct
taped together you know
I got it got it go to camera one
abusing opinions of Todd Pappy do not
represent those of cloud and frame games
Robert Space Industries or subsidiaries
right back
we really need that disclaimer reclaimer
Tom
you didn't hear this but there was this
utterly dejected British sorry
all right so we're now in our Hangar
we've now jumped into our Pisces
yeah with this to me there's still some
work that needs to be done like uh
when you request you know um
uh basically to take off like to me
there should be class ends and warnings
and other lights spinning you know going
off
um and the vo for it to be for you to
take off safely should be at the end
once the doors are actually open versus
at the beginning you know so there's
still some Polish there that needs to
happen and not every hanger is the top
loading hanger correct we've got
vertical as well as horizontal yeah so I
mean if you didn't if this were your
first time you didn't know there were
there was a doorway up would you even
look up yeah well this this is why we
teach them to hold the ZK down and just
look around before they actually take
off because
yeah for Todd it's always hanging three
but for the public it could be anything
so it could be front door in which case
you see it fine but if not if you've got
a top loading hanger then yeah you need
to know to look up so something to add
to the yeah we added that yeah so what
is he doing in the console right here
well it's lods oh yeah it's gone a lot
well to somebody who doesn't know what
he's doing uh it's basically we have um
things off in the distance that will
show uh designer or
um
kind of arted boxes
um so it basically helps us run a
consistent frame rate so he was just
going through and turning that stuff off
so it actually gave a decent looking
Skyline represents what the player would
see yeah exactly
all right so we're leaving Area 18 where
are we going
um so at the moment the players so
they've left their Hangar and we're
giving them just a basic flight around
area 18.
um it's it's night time at the moment so
you don't get to see very much but the
idea is that you get an idea of how to
fly your ship because this is the first
time that the player's been in their
ship so the path is pretty straight you
can see objective markers appearing
giving them new new places to go to so
we keep them pretty much in line so
they're not appearing off to the side
and you're having to sort of swerve your
way around
but we're also popping up hints that
give them basic controls so so you know
at the start you'll say hey you need to
raise your landing gear and this is your
throttle and how to adjust your speed
and just just various base basic hints
like that just so they get an idea of
how to fly this looks so good at night
time is there a way to always make sure
a new player gets the night time our
Corp experience no
well basically because whenever we do
the testing it's always spinning up a
new server right so I would always get
to beginning point and it's completely
dark completely black and
um so it's it's difficult to see so we
still need to work you know through some
issues for folks in the chat our clouds
obviously again this is this is a
internal build uh it's only got the
stuff we need to show the feature on
like we saw with the LOD stuff it
doesn't have all the bells and whistles
you would normally see on live
um somebody in the chat was literally I
guess I guess I guess in the recording
he just noticed the clouds were up
um one of the folks in chat mentioned
that on some localized keyboards uh z
and y are flipped correct uh does that
does that change the input no no
well it's sorry it should be that
um
yeah because it like with the German
keyboards z and y are flipped but it
should just be that's the the placement
of where it's actually at on the
keyboards it will be why it should be a
y instead of Z instead of Z and the text
will reflect that yes it should okay
it doesn't then please let us know and
we'll fix it
so okay I mean for this again like we
were just thinking what are some of the
basic things that we need to do so like
James said you know raising landing gear
teaching them basic controls as far as
you know speeding up slowing down
um and then then the next thing that was
big that we needed to teach him was was
QT and right and how to actually QT so
um blue Minx and the chat was asking why
is he just flying around why isn't he
just Q team there we're literally
teaching the process yeah so and um
again for this
I mean Sam Sam's going through and
trying to make it look pretty and and
um versus you know as an average player
you're going to be looking at it from
your cockpit you're going to be trying
to speed through it I think or or do a
speed run for it
um and
usually our reviews take 30 minutes and
maybe 10 of those are calling out notes
and talking about you know
um any sort of blockers or anything like
that so I think James and I can get
through this in what 15 minutes if that
probably yeah so
um it's usually a pretty quick
experience
so for for example like here you know
right now you have a whole bunch of QT
markers associated with this like again
one of the things that we were trying to
do was strip away all of these or or
have it be that you didn't have enough
fuel to to fly over there so then he
would have to come here refuel and then
you know things are open to uh the
player
um there's other aspects in regards to
the amount of missions that are shown to
the player and and everything yeah
yeah we we were conscious that once the
player finishes the tutorial
um of these sort of
um the missions that would be available
immediately afterwards and while we
couldn't get to all of them we've
hopefully well we've cut down the number
and we've hopefully cut down some of the
more difficult ones for new players
um so they should be they should have a
more suitable selection than they would
do previously let's say well and also so
if we talk about this let's say let's
say you are a new new player or you've
maybe you've played this one patch okay
if we do any sort of resets or wipes or
anything like that the idea would be
after you finish the new player
experience that gets you to the same
Baseline that everybody else starts the
game if they don't choose the new player
experience that is and they just started
and everything's reset it gets everybody
at the same Baseline and so again for
our missions we want to make sure that
they they Branch out it's not like
you've got you get you know 40 choices
in the very beginning you'll have three
and then you do have one and then now
that opens up two more and now you have
five available so like it's it it's
slowly Doling those things out and it's
pretty standard you know logging
features behind a long team of them I
see the key bindings on screen is that
part of the that is the contextual
control aspects that we were talking
about and also the um and part of the
contextual hands so
um because there's certain things that
we wanted to teach or reinforce to the
player
all the time
[Music]
again you know if you haven't played the
game in a while or
um or you're coming back Fresh then
basically this this allows us to
gently remind you
now uh some somebody in the chat brings
up a good question is this all within a
green zone or will or because what what
happens to group to groupers who decide
to because all the new players are going
along the same path here it basically
becomes a chow line to Grievers it does
unfortunately it does
so it's right now this is what we have
and we will continue to make it better
but we will roll this out to different
Landing zones
um obviously from there we'll also look
at feedback on you know if if people are
clubbing the baby seals over and over
and over again then we will
Institute other things to block that but
again we without I mean we had talked
about putting it on a unique uh planet
that nobody could get to nobody could QT
to and it's it's it's its own space like
we had thought about that and where
but that wasn't that's not our game yeah
you know and
um so we had those those conversations
and and talked about it
um but it just didn't feel right so uh
this is what we have and and so we need
to build and tune for a game
um and
obviously I I think you know the new
player experience at loreville versus a
new player experience at at Horizon will
be a little bit different but you know
we're just trying to teach you the main
Concepts
is the intention to develop a new player
experience for the multiple Landing
zones yes the intention is to take it to
those multiple Landing zones
but uh
I mean it's no secret that our next star
system is is pyro can you can you see a
version of the new player experience
that exists in pyro right now yeah that
I mean that that's a little bit more
difficult and I think that's something
that that James and Dan and
um Kristoff and I will need to sit down
and you know really really go through
um and and and talk about because like
right now in Empire like
should just be a guy that hands you a
pistol and says good luck yeah and like
have you enjoyed your new player
experience yeah yeah if you choose to
start in Pyro
so I turned away what are we doing now
um it well basically it teaches you to
store your ship oh and then James can go
into more details on that
yeah
um so when the player lands
um they they get out their shape and
you're sort of
um asked to ask to store it and as soon
as you stole your ship you've Landed It
by Genie points you've
learned all kinds of stuff and uh the uh
yeah that's that's the ending point
so yeah there we go
short and sweet yeah is this hydration
at 37 is that what it says yeah so it
allows you to go through and read about
any of the things that we that we teach
the player so you can you can refer back
to it and obviously for uh you know in
case you missed something or or want to
read up you know more information on on
that then this allows you to to do that
yeah one one thing we do throughout the
new player experience is to point
players towards the journal because the
journal is uh is a really good source of
information not just during the new
player experience but throughout it will
teach you about law and crime stats and
all that kind of stuff so pointing plays
to that early on gives them a tool which
they can use throughout their time with
Star Citizen and then as the new movie
glass comes online that ideally that
will free you to do all manner of
additional things to tell people yeah
like
uh the the thing the thing that
got me the whole time is the text on the
text is not being able to reposition the
windows and stuff like that that's
yeah I like Todd said because this is
the version of what we have right now
where we build we build on top of that
we build on top of that as new features
come on we add those in that is the
nature of star citizens development
yeah and I mean
basically s42 is building you know new
mobile glass framework we'll take that
framework and and adjust it you know
from a visual standpoint but then
continue to build on that for the
persistent Universe needs and so it's
it's basically we just need to wait you
know but we felt like
um the new player experience and and
what we were able to develop right now
was good enough you know obviously
there's still some bugs that we need to
work through but it was good enough to
to introduce and make sure that you know
we can actually uh lower the learning
curve that that basically new players
run into all the time
so that was a look at what's coming in
319 we talked about maybe you know
adding a a prompt to tell you to put
your helmet on before you you go out
will that make 319 is or is that going
to have to be another I don't think
that'll make 2019
um but it's possibility for a for a
future uh patch yeah okay
um until then we'll have to rely on our
wonderful community and the guides and
whatnot well and I think the other thing
that needs to be stated there is is in
the on the front end there's a actual
button there that will take you it's a
hyperlink that will take you out and
it'll take you to the guide you know on
um on the Robert Space Industries uh
website and and you'll be able to
request a guide if you want thank you
um so that so that's 319 that's it's
currently available on open PTU right
now uh any any star system backer can
can copy their account over the PTU and
test it now it's coming when 319
releases hopefully sometime in the next
week
uh it's as close as I'll get to a date
um
let's talk a little bit about the future
uh where do we we've said we've
mentioned a couple things are already
but but summarize where do we want to
take this in the future what do we
already know is on the menu that
whenever we can get to it when features
and time and everything Collide to make
it happen uh well we can do it real
quick I think um taking it to the
different Landing zones
um taking certain uh feedback that we
that we acquire
um that we need to basically flesh out
more
um and adjust that and then long term it
would be thinking about okay do we need
to do short little Mission training for
combat whether that be FPS or ship do we
need to do it for Eva do we need to do
it for missile lock so and so forth so
like everything that's you know or do we
need to do it for mining or salvaging or
any of our gameplay Loops
um and do we do these small little
Snippets of of missions that you can
load up and you can kind of rinse and
repeat those over and over again like
like a combat Mission and then a yeah a
deliver a cargo delivery Mission kind of
thing I mean it could be even smaller
than that like okay I want to
practice missile lock okay so all right
how you know spawn the scenario
you know even probably via senpod like
I'm sitting there and I can practice
okay this is how I do missile lock or I
want to shoot down a missile okay you've
got a missile coming in shoot that down
or shoot down three of them in x amount
of time so just ways for you to uh
Harden your skills and and work on very
specific scenarios that might not
opportune might not spawn themselves
unless it's in battle or something like
that so
um we're we're almost done it's it's a
shorter show this week than normal
um we all got places to go I do want to
ask you
the first version of the tutorial the
old gunny thing that was instance it was
it was essentially Arena Commander you
could say it was a simulation kind of
thing
this is obviously not this is in the Pu
was there a consideration of of making
the new player experience a simulation
you do it and then you step out of the
Sim pod and you're just safe and
completely isolated that whole time and
nobody can mess you up or why did we why
was it important that we put you in the
Pu from the moment you start so yes we
talked about it and
um that was one of the one of the
initial pitches that I did was that it
was Sim pod only and then you know after
you get out of it then now you're in a
safe area obviously there's certain
aspects you know like
um getting out of the hangar and
crashing your ship and then going to the
medical center and then so and so forth
like there were certain things there
that
um were not new user friendly
um and so but at the same time we were
we are at MMO you know and we want to
make sure that we don't isolate the
players um from their friends or from
other things that's uh you know they
could experience on their their Journey
on on the new player experience right so
so there's a certain amount of
I don't think it's a secret there's a
certain amount of chaos that comes with
the persistent universe and we're not
totally a hundred percent against chaos
you know no we like that we like that
emergent nature the the how other
players affect things exactly I I think
if if we teach them you know hey this is
what it you know works like in a in a
vacuum
you know then it's it's it's not it's
not us you know and so
um the the most vacuum aspects that we
did was all right we we said all right
this is the halves now it might be that
you know in the future you're on a ship
going to you know whatever uh major
Landing zone is going to be your home
you know and then at that point in time
you get off and and uh we still teach
you how to get to your halves or or away
from your Hab and so it there's certain
things that we know that we need to
train it's just going to be how do we go
about it and and do it but I think a lot
of the work that James and Sam and and
the rest of the team have done
um you know on creating this uh is
basically laying the foundation for
anything that we do in the future
cool well that's about it Todd James is
there is there something else I haven't
touched is there some aspect of this
that we want to make sure folks
understand before
Before I Let You Go
um I I guess for me it's been more
a labor of love I I did the initial
pitch of this
two years ago
so yeah like for for me this is this is
something that I've been wanting to see
for quite a while and now that's not the
same because people are going to grab
onto that that's not to say that this
took two years of continuous work it is
there's this has to go into the schedule
and into the resources yeah and there's
certain fundamental things that we
wanted in place first before we would do
it so
um it's just that's you know there's
other higher priorities or there's other
things but this this allowed us to you
know align you know everything comes in
in line and we understand that okay
certain features you know on and because
for example like the Henson the training
like that was on the actor team but they
had other priorities that they needed to
do and so this allowed us to to go
through and and get it
um done but like you know the initial
thought process of it and the initial
document that I wrote was yeah about two
years ago I I imagine because there's a
there's a
misapprehension that
all aspects of a game are worked on
continuously at the same time in
conjunction and stuff like this it's
it's they hear oh you're working on this
whatever it is in one month and it means
well it's been eight months it's weird
about they've been working on it for
eight months and that's not true teams
get pulled off there are dependencies
that come up we need new tech to be
developed before we can continue our
work there's any number of reasons for
people to part the project new people
join the project with new ideas and we
rethink you know oh well that's a better
idea than what we were doing it's like
this is all there's there's no end of
the reasons why development Bobs and
weaves and so that's why I always say
the only constant game development has
changed but I just I wanted to yeah no I
mean from from James's standpoint I
think you started on this wood
three four months ago yeah late last
year so you know and and
like he he was the one that did the
initial Mission and then calling out to
mft and saying hey we need this we need
this we need this and then you know it'd
be myself and and
um Phil and Jonathan from production
standpoint going around chasing up
people saying okay we need this feature
when is this coming online
um you know there was there was some new
tech that had to be created for like
mission that starts you know
um basically when the player initiates
into the world like there there were
certain fundamental things that were not
there and then there were definitely
some gotcha moments when we're going
through and we're like oh we missed this
you know oh we need this or you know and
with a lot of these things um for the
most part the way that we do our our
feedback you know or or our play tests
we do a lot of those via um
uh
you've seen seen PTU you know and seen
the evocati playing and
um it's
that's so it's the hardcore of the
hardcore but we knew for this feature
like the people wouldn't be doing that
or needing that so
um
you know so we did internal play tests
and we watched them yes a lot yeah yeah
some some real gotcha moments on James
certainly why some just just things that
surprised you well I'm looking at one
right now yeah
episode of Star Citizen live
and light improve new player experience
thank you to Todd and James for taking
time out of the end of your your week uh
uh uh thank you to Todd's uh uh uh
Offspring we're in our studio audience
uh we're forced to hang around hang out
and and see us do this uh they just
turned bright red and I love it we
didn't we don't have a camera on them
um join us back here next week uh uh
inside Star Citizen you can probably
guess what it's about I didn't see if I
was allowed to say it early so I'm not
going to say it but I mean if you watch
the very end of this week's ISC you can
probably guess what next week's ISC is
all about and then there is no uh Star
Citizen live uh next week because I'll
be on a plane to Belgium for uh Beacon
the Belgian community's annual
convention uh so you can see me over
there I'm sure there's probably a live
stream or something I'll pop up on so
for Todd and for James and for me thanks
for watching uh take care keep an eye
out on all things 319 on the
robertspaceans.com website and of course
our Star Citizen socials on Twitter and
Instagram and Tick Tock which is blowing
up apparently uh and uh yeah
I thought I had an ending for this and I
don't
bye everybody
