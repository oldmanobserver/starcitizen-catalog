foreign
to another episode of inside Star
Citizen our weekly look at the behind
the scenes development of what my mother
calls that video game Jared's making
whenever she explains it to her friends
it's quarter three and if you've been
following this show in any of its
incarnations for a while now you know
that the road to Citizen Khan is a very
interesting one for our weekly video
content as we skillfully avoid all the
Hot Topics being saved for the big now
two-day event and use that challenge as
an opportunity to explore aspects of our
development that might otherwise never
get a chance to shine it's an
opportunity this quarter to look at how
rastar is being used to remaster
existing ugfs in Alpha 320. uh to
explore racing a little bit and a new
ship that readers of jump Point magazine
in our social media channels probably
already know is on its way an update to
Claudius and how it's being used to
create even more immersive environments
heading your way and then a spin around
the whole bfx department to see what
they're up to Yes Virginia it's true
there will be fire we can do all this
and more as we navigate our journey to
the big two days in October but up this
week and my reason for sitting here at
my desk dumping just a little bit of scl
into our ISC is to talk to Torsten and
Jacob from the eupu feature team about
the prototyping process how they test
design and programming implementations
at the earliest stages and how it
relates to munching an important
component of Salvage and my nightly
routine just 20 minutes before I go to
sleep
person Jacob how you doing people doing
good
I am fine thank you
all right so we are here talking about
uh prototyping process
um before we get into it uh give me the
top level just the just the the like the
LinkedIn version answer what is a
prototype and why do we do it a
prototype basically can have several
facets in game development and for us
particular it is always about gameplay
and in this particular case it is about
the technical
the technical problems that we might
face and we might have to solve so for
that we always use prototypes and uh
play testing those prototypes is a
crucial part in game development where
it is mainly used to prove theories
whether theory is either gameplay is fun
does it technically work
and this is basically what what the the
purpose of a prototype is anything you
want to add Jacob from from more of a
Dev perspective uh we tend to take what
the designer's vision is for uh gameplay
and then we've got to figure out how can
we achieve that in the game and just as
often that's not crystal clear from the
start so we have to try a few things and
see what technical hurdles might be
ahead of us that we're going to have to
consider for the full development so
what we're going to do on this week's
show the first of our quarter three
shows where things are a little bit
different we are going to look at a
feature at the absolutely earliest stage
this is earlier than we've ever shown
any feature ever the Prototype phase uh
what we're about to show you is not
going to look good it's not going to
look pretty uh it's going to be weird
Poppy and buggy so we're just warning
you ahead before you take the footage
and put it in your YouTube videos uh
what is the Prototype that we're gonna
look at right now Jacob we're going to
be looking at the prototype for uh
monitoring the next tier of Salvage the
idea being we need some way to take
apart a larger ship and break it into
little pieces so that you can then pick
it up in your Salvage trips gain some
material from that and you'll be able to
sell that later but we're going to be
looking at just the breaking a ship
apart phase which is what we're
prototyping here right so I got it
queued up here let's take a look at this
here so obviously this is a vulture
approaching a Gladius
yep
um so with the Prototype we've added in
a new monitoring mode sub mode to
salvage so all of that whole scraping
uis disappeared and we're going down to
just what we need for this prototype
which is the ability to break a
partnership which at the moment is going
to look exactly the same as if you blew
it up with your guns but in future that
would look rather different what's
happening right here I see the bar
filling up on the left okay with the
ship yeah so this is the placeholder for
the actual gameplay that would happen
here the design will have some actual
gameplay for what you have to do as a
player to break the trip apart but we
put in that little placeholder which is
just essentially a timer a progress bar
based on how big the target is and that
is actually on on purpose because
the question that we are asking in this
prototype are more technical
that means that we don't have we
shouldn't focus on the gameplay aspect
so we should keep the gameplay as
minimal or as simple as possible and
then so that we can fully focus on the
technical bits of of the Prototype okay
so we saw it we saw it broken into some
you know what look like normal debris
but now we got to break it into smaller
munchable steps we'll go back to the
video here so breaking it into normal
debris is stuffy that you've seen before
but when we have this bigger part it
doesn't come apart into more pieces
naturally so in this prototype we are uh
just deleting the thing and replacing it
with loads of tiny little placeholder
pieces to act as the monster
Department's debris uh what you're also
seeing is a prototype for how you will
get those pieces into your cargo which
is a little suction feels it grabs those
little pieces drags them towards the
grinder in the mouth of the vulture and
from there they're converted into cargo
there's a little pieces that we saw are
obviously not arted and everything I
want to remind people again we've
literally never shown anything in a
prototype Facebook Facebook so forgive
me for reiterating this two or three
more times before we're done here this
is designer art just small pieces to
represent the kind of the mass and the
size of of stuff that we might be using
it's even worse it's colder art yes
indeed this is this is the programmer
equivalent of a white box test uh where
I'm not even qualified to make white
boxes so I just rip off other assets
that I found in the engine and just slap
them together so that's what this is and
obviously without being a prototype
there's no VFX there's no explosions
there's no beams there's none of the
things that would mask this transition
that would normally happen you know so
that you don't see the the pieces just
uh just pop in you know like like
they're currently doing
yes
um all right so that was done on your
local machine uh just you know you on
your workstation doing an a local
version of of the the universe here uh
the next phase as I understand it is to
test it in pu conditions and we're going
to go ahead and start this video because
this video is going to go for a little
bit tell me what we're doing here yeah
so I'll tell you what we're doing and
then we can discuss later why we're
doing that exactly
um what we're doing right here is uh I
want to test a worst case performance
conditions so I'm chucking in some
console commands to load up or stream in
uh several different Landing zones at
the same time uh because otherwise me is
just one player on the server I wouldn't
really be loading that much I wouldn't
be stressing the server so I'm gonna
stress it quite a lot by loading up as
many Landing zones as I can think of off
the top of my head basically until I see
that server FPS count go appreciably
lower
[Music]
um and then only once I've done that am
I going to step into the actual gameplay
test I also noticed you've upgraded from
a Gladius 2 and 890 jump yes because
when I think worst case for breaking a
big thing into small things I want the
biggest possible thing which is going to
require lots and lots of small things so
yeah 890 jump is a good candidate for
that okay so
what are you typing here oh yeah uh I'm
yeah just typing in some comments for
the uh other recipients of this video
because this was uh an internal video
for you know reviewing stuff do you have
to use console commands to leave notes
for people
or otherwise uh but it's the most
convenient so all right so we've got so
we've got the server simulating pu
conditions all the all the landing zones
are are loaded at once instead of you
know streaming in and out like they
would normally would so it's actually
worse than you would see on a normal pu
in date and we're going to see that
immediately that uh this breaking the
trip apart uh that we saw work so nicely
in the editor well I've really annoyed
the server here because all of these
pieces uh yeah popping in in a not so
great way and I make a bit of a
sarcastic comment about it in the uh in
the console
um but uh yeah it's important to create
these conditions you know to test these
things not just in ideal conditions not
just the ideal Universe of your own
computer or even the Pu when it's like
first loads and nobody's in and
everything's great no indeed what I'm
testing here is worse than we would hope
it ever to be we don't want it to ever
be this bad but we gotta test it because
might be I'd say now beams we're going
shooting out starting to break apart
yeah there'd be extra gameplay here
that'd be fair thanks whatever but in
the editor version we saw pretty much as
soon as the the big piece disappeared
all those tiny little bits turned up
well it's not going to go that way in in
this situation we're going to be waiting
quite some time for all those little
pieces to turn up gotcha and so while
we're waiting for this uh pieces to to
turn up here
um let's talk about what we learned from
uh what we've learned from these tests
so far
um obviously there's some form and stuff
but there's also some gameplay
implications from what we've seen uh
touristy you want to talk us through it
well I can talk about some parts that we
learned from right so it's so the best
thing that you can learn from a
prototype is actually everything that
goes bad because this is the stuff that
you can then iterate on and make the the
gameplay or the the technical stuff even
better so
um from the gameplay perspective so I
will just talk about the gameplay stuff
and Jacob can talk about what we learned
from technical perspective there is
from the gameplay we learned that what
about big ships so how for example now
you saw the vulture trying to attach to
the 890 jump that is a bit of a wonky
situation and it doesn't feel right so
what what about vultures actually
munching bigger ships so how can we make
that an interesting gameplay then you
saw in the first video what happens when
uh the the ship transitions into the
smaller bits so the masking is is a huge
topic that we have to solve so that it
feels right and you don't notice that
one element pops away and another
element Pops in so we definitely have to
mask that then uh what you might have
seen in the first part is the conversion
of materials I don't know if you paid
attention to the filler station bar that
basically fills the SEO crates on the
back side of the wheelchair but that
feel drastically faster than it would
normally do with Hull scraping that
means that
it would be more painful for you to
munch because you have to stand up from
your seat more often go down to the
filler station remove the boxes so this
is definitely an issue that we then have
to solve because we really don't want to
have this gameplay to be
more tedious than it's
has to be so we have to find a solution
how we can make it more like a
yeah much nicer for for the player to
actually remove those crates there
then uh the navigation around the pieces
is also something that we notice isn't
that fun so we will probably utilize the
tractor beams there because we are
anyway working on them but maybe that
makes it much easier for players instead
of flying around and getting the pieces
between the fork of the wheelchair and
then having it disintegrate but instead
you pulling the pieces in with the
tractor beam
another Fork of the wheelchair is very
limiting in terms of what pieces will
fit so this is also something we learned
and a big thing is uh what which already
is standing out is how can we make it
fun and unique for the reclaimer so we
just we're looking at the Prototype at
the vulture and the big question that
our team was asking in the end of that
prototype was like
okay how can we facilitate the claw and
the unique neatness visuals or the
uniqueness in general of the reclaimer
to actually facilitate that gameplay and
have it stand out and be meaningful and
fun all right so a lot of a lot of
gameplay a lot of gameplay implications
from just that little prototype uh Jacob
what would you what was your takeaways
uh from the from the tech perspective
I'm looking at things like the
performance and also uh just
um
what am I going to have to account for
to achieve the designer's vision here
I know that we're going to want things
like the time that it takes to destroy
something to be somewhat proportional
for its size and mass but from the
initial prototype I could already see
that uh a bigger piece taking longer it
already takes you know a few seconds
with the Gladius if we're going to scale
that up and scale up the time as well
proportionally to a to a big Target
we're going to have to think about what
equation are we going to use for scaling
that so that it doesn't take you ages uh
to like sitting there for minutes to to
break something apart I got to think
about how I'm going to hook in the
visual effects and the audio whatever
what dependencies am I going to need to
make well get involved speaking of you
know judging time uh The Entity system
is taking a little bit of time to spawn
all the spawn and debris we've been
talking uh this is still going at the
moment
obviously there's going to have to be
some optimization work there with the
entity system this is a kind of
what we've got with with PES is that uh
it's not quite as quick to create
entities as before we had PS
um and you we have all sorts of great
stuff that comes with PES so this is
just a small limitation that we have to
learn to work around uh but it tells us
that gameplay ideas that we had before
PS might need some adaptation in order
to work efficiently uh in the the post
PES world
so yeah so speaking of which let's go
back to the video I think we're about to
get the entity spawns now
and he's saying this yeah
any moment now yeah there we go there we
go and then play a bit of a flicker as
they come in but they're finally here so
yeah this this tells us well
in this worst case scenario uh this
performance is obviously unacceptable uh
we're going to have to do something
about this so we are thinking about uh
how can we change our approach how can
we optimize what we've got discussions
in various different directions but this
is a key takeaway from this prototype
because if it had gone differently if if
we tried this and the piece is turned up
in just a few seconds or so then we'd
have known that this approach on the
whole was probably acceptable and with a
little bit of optimization it would work
but that's not what happened the stuff
took minutes to arrive and that means we
have to do some more serious rethinking
about how we're going to approach this
the vision and the the basically the
acceptance criteria or directors Define
they they they are still untouched right
so those are still to be fulfilled
and even the overall Vision that we as
the team defined for how that gameplay
should play out those those will be like
those are already set in stone because
we all agreed on those
but how the actual gameplay then plays
and feels this is still affected by uh
by the Prototype a prototype like this
is really perfect for for stepping in
early and making sure that every every
tick box on our acceptance criterias has
met and uh we can make a better gameplay
out of it I I think we all have a a a
real uh desire and responsibility
towards you know testing these things as
often and as early and under as much
duress as possible uh to as we work to
stabilize the Pu and make it a more
enjoyable experience going forward so I
torson uh Jacob thank you thank you for
hanging out with us today thank you very
much bye bye
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
so what do we learned this week well we
learned that prototyping doesn't really
look like much of anything but it's an
essential step towards proving out
design and performance before all the
artists and other devs go in to do their
thing that it's just as important to
prove out good ideas and good paths to
take as it is to encourage developers to
seek out another way towards success and
that it's important to continue refining
not just the features and content being
made but the very way that we test those
things earlier and earlier and under a
scale of duress for inside Star Citizen
I'm Jared Huckabee thank you for letting
us share the process of game development
with you and we'll see you all here next
week
