so what happened since the last time we
talked about Sage so the last time we
talked about it it was about the
prototypes that we were doing with uh
the entities Spawn from the entire piece
so the thousand and thousands of
entities we had to reconsider our
approach quite a lot because it was
Apparent from the Prototype that several
aspects of it weren't really going to
work the way we wanted to with the demo
failing or basically showing us the
limits of our engine which was the
entity count uh by showcasing that it
takes a really long time to spawn all
the entities that would fit the size of
an 890 jump we also had to reconsider
some things because we wanted to get
this in players hands as soon as
possible so that means making a few
adjustments to the scope we're asked to
come up with a solution by end of this
year which is structural
Savage
structural Salvage is breaking apart
various ships in order to break down the
pieces into construction material which
then you can sell so it's just removing
stuff from the persistent database so
one of the challenges of developing a
live game like Star Citizen is that we
have to constantly be weighing up trying
to perfect a feature which could take
years or trying to get something
playable in players hands so that we can
start getting feedback from it and
learning from it and figuring out how it
fits in with the rest of the game so it
was very important for us that we get
some version of it out this year it's
not the full version yet but it's a good
first step that allows us to test the
feature and close the ships that we
already have that are the vulture and
the
reclaimer the new vulture gameplay
Builds on what we already have the idea
is that you'll approach a wreck we want
to encourage you to use the hard
scraping first so you don't lose the
armc in the process Which is higher
value per seu than construction
materials so the vulture is equipped
with a resonance field which allows you
to charge up energy on the
target assuming that it's still in one
piece if you've not already blown it up
with guns or missiles or something
you'll have to fracture it first a
fracture field is built up between the
arms but it's also projected outwards
which will break it down into various
parts we want to make sure that the
residence field wasn't going to create
opportunities for griefing so uh we've
taken the precautions a step further
from Hull scraping which requires that
the targets Shields are off to
structural Salvage requiring that the
ship's power is entirely off so it'll be
quite hard to use that offensively
unless you find a way to disable the
target's power plant and then you switch
to the disintegration mode which then
disintegrates those parts and draws them
into your Salvage ship as construction
material then into the The Grind and
then into the internal storage and from
there you can then move it out through
the fill station into the Cyd the
internal storage is one of the great
additions we've made here what that is
is basically a temporary storage between
you Gathering the material and you
putting the material into cargo boxes
you have more space inside of your ship
so when you now go back to the filler
stations instead of the material just
being stored in the filler station you
now draw from this pool of internal
storage that is slightly bigger than uh
the actual cargo capacity of the V and
the reclaimer so you can basically fill
up your ship first while it is still
filling while it is partly full or when
it is full you have someone else or
yourself go down to the filler station
and basically convert everything or all
the resources that you have inside the
the internal storage into the cargo
boxes the boxes come out automatically
so they deplete the internal storage and
you will be able to move those boxes
around on the cargo grid which does
really help with the player experience
of the vulture a lot of people were
saying was problematic cuz there was a
lot of getting up from the seat going
back and then going back to the pilot
seat again so uh this is an improvement
there once you've essentially got all of
the stuff out of the filler stations
you'll be able to fly them somewhere and
sell
them the reclaimer game play is very
similar to that of the vulture except
that it's all done by the claw operator
who is the co-pilot seat you may notice
that the claw of the reclaimer will look
different I think the art team did a
really good job
[Music]
there so we got the request to start
looking at the structural Salvage
feature support you know the feature
team reach out to us and explain to us
what they want to do and and how it was
all going to work and obviously that
means that from our point of view
there's a few things we needed to do
it's always had this kind of great big
claw on underneath it you know under
slung under the cab and now is the time
that we were going to look at it and
kind of make that nice kind of feature
of the ship actually function now we
have the game play defined and redesign
or revisualization
[Music]
when you were sat in the the operator
seat and because of that we tried a few
different options out with the claw kind
of like facing forward originally and
then we kind of had it facing up we
wanted to have the hand of the claws
actually upward facing so that we have
it easier accessible by the tractor beam
Gunners on the reclaimer so they can
feed into the the hand but we realize
with the updated position that is more
forward facing it makes more sense
because we hadly navigate that the the
hand is below it and with the tractor
beam it still work works you will no
doubt have noticed that we're no longer
calling this feature Ming and that's
because we just didn't have the
bandwidth to support an actual physical
munching action of The Claw on the
original it was like claw that would rip
things apart now the feature isn't
working like that so now it acts as the
field emitter for the resonance and
disintegration Fields you can still
start with h scraping and we highly
encourage you to to actually do that so
that you get the the armc which we will
increase in value so it will be worth
your time to actually do the extra step
and Claw will activate the resonance
field of fracture field of the claw and
the claw operator then needs to
communicate with the pilot to bring the
color into the position of the Target
that you want to fracture once the
target is in the fracture field of the
claw the claw operator will press a
button a timer will run down and the
ship that is affected by it will break
into pieces currently you're not able to
move the claw around but the remote
turrets do have tractor beams on them
not only you can hold the objects or
rotate the objects with the tractor V
you can now also pull the objects into
the resonance field or into the
disintegration field the idea is that
you use the tractor beams to grab any
drifting pieces and move them into the
field and the next step then is actually
converting those pieces that you just
created into the resources that you want
to gather and for that the claw operator
will switch into the disintegration mode
again you press a button the ship is
basically heated up and then converted
into a material we needed a way of
getting collecting all that material and
that's where we decided to take some
inspiration from what we did on the the
vulture between these kind of big
admitters we were still sucking in all
this material and that material was then
being processed and ground up and kind
of sent down to the main ship itself and
then directly moved into the internal
storage of the reclaimer the filler
stations in the reclaimer have been
changed as well because the reclaimer is
such a big ship and having it just one
Su containers for like 360 seu of space
was laborious to that uh we also allow
you to uh create bigger boxes now on the
reclaimer so it's not only the one suu
boxes that you currently have but it's
one two we don't have four but we have
eight and 16 which then you can go about
stacking to your hearts content we
really wanted to reduce the amount of
back and forth that you have to do and
we think it's a it's a good
solution one of the distinctions with
the reclaimer though is that it can
break apart basically any size Target
whereas the vulture is limited to only
up to a certain size of ship So
currently anything above I think it's
the star runner can't be fractured by
the vulture which is something you would
need the reclaimer to fracture if you
can find one of these big wrecks
obviously there's a lot of material to
be gained from this which means
obviously more seu to be sold at the end
which is vastly more profit we like to
think that it would be more profitable
to do this than the vulture but
obviously the vulture is still very much
convenient if you're a single player
goes around doing single player Salvage
we're still very interested in enhancing
the destruction side of structural
Salvage more similar to what was
originally conceptualized with munching
but we're going to have to wait for
mstom to be more fully realized before
we can start experimenting with
that so we've done a few things to
improve the quality of life of Salvage
in general first of all the vulture has
some interesting features that you can
control each of its little Salvage arms
independently so that you can hold on to
a target with a tractor beam some of the
elements that you will have have in
front of you the sum of all the the the
pieces that you will have in front of
you will be too much for your cargo hold
so what you shouldn't do in that time is
actually trigger the disintegration
because every material inside that field
will be disintegrated or material will
be lost that way this is where the
tractor beams come in place because you
can move out those objects that would
make your internal storage over SP so
you you get this nice little gameplay of
yeah I I actually pick what I want to
grab we also already in slight update to
the crafting that we have in there so
now that we have two materials we
adjusted the the crafting costs in the
in the filler station so they are now
more realistic so they are not
punishingly expensive anymore for the
future it will be even more meaningful
because then like the material
composition will be different so it's
not only construction materials but it's
specific to the parts that you have
there but that is for the far future so
it's not for now one of the the most
prominent quality of features is the
changes to the filler station on both
the vulture and the reclaimer they now
have the option to set the filler
station to Auto eject mode where it will
just repeatedly eject the last selected
crate which lets you rapidly unload the
internal storage into cargo boxes as
long as you're quick enough at putting
them on the cargo grid releasing
structural survage in 322 will give
players an opportunity to play it and
start giving us feedback on how we can
continue to build on it for the
future Salvage like its industrial
profession cousins Mining and cargo is
an iteratively developed feature that
gets its next evolution in the upcoming
Alpha 322 and if we've learned anything
this week it's that the path is almost
never a straight line I'm serious torson
has been on Spectrum all week providing
even newer details than what was
available when we filmed you're going to
want to check that out for inside Star
Citizen I'm Jared hucke thanks for
letting us share the process of game
develop with you we'll see you all here
next
