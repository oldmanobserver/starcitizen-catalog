hi everybody welcome to another episode
of Star Citizen live
game death
Mission maker
I don't know what was wrong with the
Cadence there I just
how you doing I'm good I'm good uh
uh I'm Jared I'm your humble uh sidekick
this week uh with the in-depth shows we
usually kind of turn over the driving
force to one of our developers who takes
you through a bit of their process over
the next hour uh this week we have
um
and what do you do I make missions well
I'm a lead there's a lead designer now
so not as much missions anymore but I
still make missions
what he said uh we are going to attempt
something that
every single person told me was probably
a bad idea including me we are going to
attempt
to make a mission
from scratch
using the mission verb star words data
Forge Robo Hesse all the cool tools that
are used and see if we can't make a
mission and even get inside and play it
for a little bit within the span of an
hour
can it be done
I think so
finally I'll be able to prove the
community wrong because everyone says I
can't make missions
we'll find out
right so at this point in the show I'm
going to turn it over to who are you
again oh my God Elliott Mobile Elliott
Malby and uh he's going to take you
through a little bit of the the rough
flow uh introduce you to the idea of it
so Elliot that's your camera right there
let's go to that camera
so sit back a little bit frame there you
go there you go good framing so tell
them what we're doing today so uh today
we're going to be going through uh a
mission so we we have a sort of a rough
rough pitch outline for it so I am going
to be making a prototype uh experience
of the mission where we can play it see
how it feels see how it plays and then
iterate on it improve it and then decide
if we if we want to like
wait for more things to come in to make
it even better or if we think it's a
good enough experience to put it out and
then improve on it as time passes by so
that's pretty much it so walk us through
what's the rough flow what are we aiming
to do okay right so the roof flow is
we're doing a subdue and Recovery
Mission which is uh I go to a location I
uh knock the AI out and then I have to
go and deliver them that is the very
roughest flow of it Bob's your uncle
simple right
no okay
um so is there any more to explain
before we start let me jump into the
process
um
yeah so there's a couple of things that
I'm going to try to do
um so as people might know I don't like
hand-holding
um so for there's certain things we do
currently in status and for example when
you get to the Loki
when you get to the location we uh
we would Mark the ship and then when the
AI spawns we then Mark the AI for you to
get listen right it's warm I've got like
a 20 pound like staring at me
so we we then Mark the AI for you to
take out now I'm going to try and remove
those aspects so I want to leverage the
scanning gameplay so you actually have
to ping scan whatever to find the
shipping once it has been detected by
your ship I'll mark it then and then
when you get into the ship I won't Mark
the AI directly I will wait until either
they see you or you are within a certain
range of them um this is kind of like an
imperfect solution because it's either I
mark them so you always know where they
are and you B-Line straight to their
location I do this
but the perfect solution would be say
FPS scanning
um but we don't have that yet so it's
kind of like playing with the mission
and it's trying to understand what the
end goal of the mission is going to be
like
um while we finished it all right so
let's start so let's start the screen
share uh every good Mission starts with
uh helpful encouragement from Luke
Presley yes we have Luke so we're
already ahead uh introduce us to our
tools what are we using to call okay so
what the main and biggest tool that a
designer uses is Robo Hesse this is a
tool that takes all of our perforce
streams and loads like loads them all
here so it's very quick for us to click
and go through them so if I was to click
this it shows other perforce streams and
I can just jump between them and I can
click open my tool here open my tool
here open my tool there I can do things
like I can get a new build I can have
certain change certain files I care
about for sync so for example like
latest subsumption will just pull my
subsumption files ocean levels will just
pull the latest object containers and
levels which obviously helps to speed up
testing and gameplay and then there's
the things here to boot the game and
things like that this tool was made by
amazing Jake mule well not ours anymore
and uh me me Ben Dorsey and Andrew Hesse
helped to design it and it has saved so
many hours not just on mft's side it is
a lot of the people in the company use
it so
so I'd use this to boot on my tools and
the tools I need are things like
subsumption which is our logic based
editor which I'll full screen in a
minute uh star words this thing which is
how we build strings for the game and
last but not least
data Forge and this is how we build
oh my God like everything in the game
this is where you build entities it's
where you build missions it's where you
build everything pretty much everything
that's not a mission now uh you skipped
over the Star Wars it's been a long time
since we've talked about Star Wars you
say strings this is text strings lock ID
is the code so it's uh it's text that we
put in and we sort of we put in the game
but it's it's in this sort of tool here
so people can localize it for other
languages
um but it's always like linked to one
one place it's quite common in in the
games industry to have this sort of
stuff but this is a really cool
interface they've built for us to use it
now cool all right so first things first
um so I've talked about the rough flow
um so I need to think of a story now I
have been mulling over a story for a
while so what I'm going to do is I'm
going to create a folder for my story to
go into
um and this is going to be called sub
deal sub deal I can't spell by the way
and recover
boom
and then when it responds already there
we go beautiful hey
my PC is not a good PC okay
um so I've opened up the folder for
subdue and recover and then here I'm
going to make a bunch of strings so
I need to make a story
so
uh the story usually consists of
um
three three initial strings which would
be the title the description and then
the from string I don't need to use the
from string because I'm going to use a
mission Giver that already exists I'm
going to use Ruto I'm sure many of you
know router
and so what I'm going to do is I'm going
to make so the lock ID is how we link it
so the English text is the text and the
lock ID is how we sort of link it uh to
this so I'm going to do subdu SUB oh my
God subdue and recover
underscore title and what I'm going to
do to save myself time is I'm going to
copy that so I don't have to retype it
new description
so uh the title is going to be which
I've again I've already thought of the
story this was this was I planned the
story ready for this because I thought
it was good the title is going to be
called a personal request
and the description which I'll open into
a big window so everyone can see it
is this ruto's asking for help his jump
town operation has recently come under
attack and we've been struggling to get
the maze to where he needs it to be a
certain pirate arguably the worst has
been causing havoc and stopping his
operatives from extracting it for that
for Ruto
he wants you to hunt and bring them down
bring them back to him alive he wants to
punish them and recoup his losses
emotionally and let's see if they can
still say all good ships have a name
after he's finished with them so you're
going to go to the location you're going
to bring back void dude and bring him
back alive and if you complete this root
oil exposes other hit list for you to
bring in people like detox old man Jody
Morgan Blasphemous and Xperia so they're
all going to be haunted next up
so
this is the starry string sorry I'm
laughing my own jokes
always
there's my story string now after this I
have to create a bunch of other strings
to do with the actual Mission so this is
going to be a bit of typing uh or yeah
actually I can take it from my document
where I plan some of this
so
so we've got the title we've got the
description so we're going to go through
little bits of it so
I'm gonna go just kind of go through
so we have in in missions you have like
a long objective a short objective you
have a hood and you have a marker
um they
all have separate strings because we
might want to adapt them in different
ways to display different things for the
player so what I've done here is I've
put um
so I've done the subdue and delivered
I'm doing the locate part of it so this
is before you've you've found them this
is finding them this is the HUD section
now so what this is is on the top of
play screen it will say locate
and right now on the screen you'll see a
weekly line and it says Mission and
brackets Target name it looks very weird
but what this is is that is a token and
what a token is is that allows us to
dynamically pull in data from the live
game so this is how we're able to do
things like
um
generate a name randomly as we go along
and have it fill in so this would read
locate void dude or it could say locate
books or it could say locate gabs it
could it could say locate Jared like
it could pull whatever from our random
system
um so I'm filling these out these are
the long and shorts so the long is the
long is what you see in your Moby glass
when you pull up your arm the short is
what appears when we flash those
notifications up to you
um cool
this one
that I'm doing here is an objective
setup now this one is specifically for
How I build the mission because if I'm
thinking about the mission in a theory
kind of way and this is how when we
build missions we think like this for
other designers sakes so I go okay well
the missions are subdue and deliver so
what is it I've got to go there we've
got to enter the location the AI is
going to be spawned once I've knocked
them out I take them to a location oh
that's a delivery module that's the
delivery modular system
uh so this is a part of the delivery
modular system that allows me to take
the target's name inject it onto the
target so this will basically say when
you've knocked void dude out it will say
deliver void due to wherever
cool
um next up we have the uh oh so uh the
way that I'm thinking about this is I
want to show something cool and new that
you guys might not have seen there is a
designer on our team called Nick erko
who has been working on uh [ __ ] having
ships like the 890 jump but all have ai
on so we could do things missions of the
future where you just have to go and
eliminate a certain person on a ship or
you've got to go into the ship for some
reason we want combat in there so I'm
going to be using that so I want to name
the ship
uh so I'm gonna name the ship all good
ships which is just because that's what
void dude says
next up I need to make a few mushrooms
so I'm just going to spam that bun a
little bit
uh locating subdue right so then these
are the next parts so this is the the
subdue part of the mission so this is
the player has to
um
this is the general part of the mission
sorry this is like the header objective
that's going to be go there and take
them out
again it uses the tokens
I'm gonna just drag and drop some of the
other ones in there
some of this I probably won't be I feel
like I should never had dead Ed but some
of it's going to be because I'm
literally when I'm building this I'm
just starting my desk with my headphones
on quietly
very quietly
cool
I've already got the time nice so uh I
think that might be all the strings I
was requiring so I'm going to carry on
filling these out
so this is again just expanding the
story this is locate uh and the and
subdue come on Elliot that's meant to be
locate and subdue I can't spell uh all
right English the target name and
deliver their body to the mission
destination that's going to dynamically
pull in where we send the player
and we've got the marker
so that is again that's the marker that
will be
on I don't know wherever I choose to use
it it could be on the ship it could be
on the AI once you've found it yeah
and then
so that's the moment okay the target
marker so this one is definitely going
to be on the air because I've got a
Target marker and then Target ship last
of all uh that is the
marker I believe on the ship that I need
yeah I don't want that empty string Okay
cool so that's pretty much all the
strings so the last thing I need to do
is make sure that I can see the strings
we have these labels to where we can
stay where you can see them
um
so I'm going to set them to PU
and I'd save that and that is my that's
my strings done and ready to go so I'm
gonna I'm gonna get rid of that now and
what does the string get you
uh it gets us when we're building the
mission it allows it to see a flow of
objectives and see if we're giving
enough information if we're not giving
enough information uh it lets us check
that the the sort of the dynamic
information that we pass into these
strings actually works
do things like that yeah basically all
the text that's going to show up on
screen for people whether it's a Moby
glass or their advisor yeah okay
just hydrating one second okay
next up I am gonna build the missions uh
well not the missions the modules so
these are pieces of logic uh that will
tie together to make the mission now
because we try to think modularly I have
to think about how I'm gonna do this so
because I want to show you the ship
thing
um an occupied ship we don't have
anything to spawn them yet so I'm gonna
build one so I'm gonna build it but it's
going to be a module and put it in the
module folder and that's because it has
other use outside of the mission it's
it's it isn't a mission on its own it is
purely a piece of logic that fulfills a
function for us so I'm going to call it
Arc you pied ship
spawner
so then what happens here is I can go
from my pony call and says can Jared
look any more unprofessional
is that a challenge
I can try
keep going
um
right free in it okay okay so when
you've made a mission you are given in
it and in it is
um the initialization of the module and
the unana is the uninitialization of the
module that's basically I've started
I've
shut down yes
but we need to inject one more onto here
so I'm going to make a
Tree in it
a pre in it is the pre-initialization
stage this
um this is where for example
I would uh so when socks came in uh
Surfside object container streaming it
meant that nothing in the world existed
which changed how we built logic because
previously everything was streamed in uh
so we used to know where everything was
you could build the complete opposite
end of the thing to a pencil and I knew
the pencil was there now I don't know
anything exists so I have to tell you to
go there so I know it exists
um but that means I have to tell my
module not to just start up because
without pre in it it'll just boot up as
soon as you accept it and I don't want
that I want it to boot up when certain
conditions are fulfilled
um
so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a
input variable so this is going to be
passed into the module by myself or a
designer and the input is going to be of
type Mission data Century this is this
replicant replicant this represents our
sorry I'm thinking Mom type in there we
go this represents like our locations in
the world that's the sort of data form
we have so I'm gonna throw on a set
Module location
so this note allows us to tell the pre
in it not to fire
until the mission location that I pass
in has told it each loaded so the
mission location has a
an like it's assigned to an object
container so when that object container
is going to have loaded
this will then go hey it's all ready for
you and I can move forward with it
um I'm not going to say to go someplace
it doesn't exist yet exactly
so what I'm next going to do is I'm
going to get that Mission locations
object container
and I'm going to make a so the
difference between these two panels This
is
um I use the word Global but it's it's
it the they like restrict the scope in
which you can see variables so this one
is the global so the all these variables
here for the everything in this column
this these variables can be accessed by
any of these like Scopes here whereas
this is restricted only to the pre in it
these are my local variables
um so I use these because
I will clog up my Global variables if I
didn't I don't want them there it's more
efficient for me to make these ones that
kind of just get like yeated once the
whole thing's turned off or has stopped
running in this case so I'm going to
make a local reference to the location
object container
and then I'm gonna and then I'm gonna
get the object's position
um because
what what uh what I'm gonna have the
designer do is I'm gonna have the
designer pass me in the ship that they
want to spawn occupied
oh pardon me and then I'm gonna spawn
spawn it so I need to know the position
so I can sort of anchor that as the
route of where I'm gonna spawn the AI in
these sort of area
so I need to find a local positions it's
gonna be location pause
pause what's called l
cool uh underscore L is only so like if
I'm if you're not looking here I can
tell where the variable scope is set so
I can like quickly know if it's used
outside of here or not
uh request
response around position
um so this so when I open this this is
our quick task selector we also have
all of this you can go through and
select but I just happen to know the
names of the nodes because I use them on
a daily basis
uh right okay so next up I need to make
the data
that the designer is going to pass to me
or I'm gonna pass to me futureelli is
going to pass but also designers when
they use this
of type spawn description a spawn
description is um
imagine it like a recipe book it's a
recipe book before you bake the cake and
put it in the oven it's like all the
information that it's going to use to
build the cake
that's terrible I'm sorry
uh you're doing so good I know I listen
um you know what it's weird as well
because I'm a lead so I have to train
people you guys this is what my team get
enough to build missions with so
cool so occupied ships to spawn so this
is gonna be that cookbook I've given
um I'm gonna keep saying it you can all
deal with it um and I'm gonna then then
we have the sort of next thing sorry the
the next inputs are the position so
that's going to be the root point of
where we spawn and then I have a range
and a spread range is it takes the point
and then it sort of smooth like makes a
circle at a certain range that's safe
and then spawns it so mid is like
5K and I think point is like directly on
it and what it does is it starts at that
range so if I specify mid it will start
from 5K out of that Circle and start
searching for a safe location so it
doesn't spawn into collisions and
players can't get it and bloody blah
blah I'm going to set it to close so
it's uh and this way it doesn't always
spawn in the exact same spot every
single time because that would be
incredibly repetitive yes it allows us
to definitely
get that sort of element of it feeling
somewhat fresh every time you go there
because if you know where everything is
the mission becomes easy
next up I need to make a spawn request
variable so I'm going to call this
occupied ship underscore Sr so a spawn
request or this so the the blue the blue
input these blue things are inputs and
the gray thing is an output so this is
going to take this data in and then it's
kind of giving me a receipt and it's
going
um will
contact you about your receipt whenever
we've done whatever you've asked us to
my sorry that's terrible that's even
worse
um but basically allows us to get these
this information back
here so I can I can tell sort of if
certain things have been fulfilled so
for example I'm going to make a on chips
Bond and I'm gonna also tidy this up
because we don't build stuff like that
because it looks horrible uh callbacks
gonna put it in this folder thank you
cool and then next up I'm gonna build
the um so now the ship spawned so I'm
like okay cool the ship has spawned uh
that's great now I need to actually
spawn the air spill on the AI on it so
what I'm gonna do is I want to check to
see if this is the initial spawn of the
ship which is this thing
um
and then if it is the initial spawn of
the ship I want to do a lot of sell but
I don't want to do it every time because
we get this call back whenever the ships
are streamed back in so if you go away
from it the stream ship streams out uh
when you come back we need to retell the
like
say say it's like a bounty so you've got
your target Ai and he's got a bunch of
mates we have to retell his mates to
defend their mate or else they forget
um so that's what we have this callback
for it's very useful for that sort of
stuff next up I'm going to send an event
to a mission instance and the mission
instance is going to be the parents
I find it the parents Mission this is
basically because I know this module is
going to be called by another module it
means that I need to communicate back to
that module to tell it when I've done
things
um so for example I'm gonna jump and get
this modular event so we build a bunch
of events that um if we if we identify
that we're sending
um a lot of events and they're always in
the same sort of format we'll just use a
modular event it's the same as modular
Mission it's just for a modular event
um and I'm gonna pass in the spawn ship
so the spawn ship these are things
returned to me so when that callback is
fired so hey the ship spawned it will
return to me these uh variables filled
in so it will give me identifier tags
these are tags are placed on the uh the
ship so I can identify what is the
industrial spawn bowling discussed that
the pilot of this ship and the ship
itself that has been spawned so next I'm
gonna make sure that I send back
that information because future Elliot
might need it and also the design might
need it
cool next up I need to find objects in
the ship so the ship spawned and now I
need to spawn AI on the ship so that
means that I need to search the ship for
a spawn closet manager this is uh the so
we do a lot of searching via tags
because it's very efficient and it's not
expensive to search
uh so I'm going to make a tag search
here for the spawn closet
spot come on spawn classes of course
being where NPC ships or Fighters or
whatnot pop into the universe behind a
curtain where they can't be seen usually
yeah and this one this one specifically
is for uh so the ship is gonna have ai
on it so this one's gonna grab the ones
that are on the ship directly and then
tell them to spawn
um so the spawn closet system even
though it's called spawn closet we don't
have to use it like a closet with a door
we can also use it for what we call
Initial spawns which is when the
location is first loaded in and the
player isn't there we can populate the
mountain about because
like if you get to a location and you
was to beat the streaming and you just
see them all walking out of doors you're
gonna be like well hold on so you've
just come out because I'm here so it
makes me feel more alive if we can have
them already out and trying to find
their usables and sometimes the curtain
is just getting them there before the
player yeah exactly
next up I'm gonna
return the found objects which is going
to be the um
uh ships
manages
[Applause]
oh my God how much time do I have left I
have my um
you're doing good sweetie I mean
are you a winning son no I'm like barely
through the first half you're gonna have
to make this a two-part
cool uh I'm trying to be fast now uh
next up is the loop until this is
basically because there's going to be
more than one spawn Closet in here
um I need to go through each of the
spawn closet managers and make sure that
I um
I I send the request to them so another
variable that I need to create for our
designers is an input variable again of
type spawn descriptions
called NPC uh
NPCs
to
populate ships
I sometimes you just call it what it is
you know there's this too in in when I
was when I was in school they taught me
two of the hardest things in computer
science was cash invalidation and naming
conventions
and naming conventions is the number one
yeah it's the number one
um current score yeah we'll do we'll do
part two next week
I haven't asked Elliot but I'll
volunteering for it there we go don't
worry about it we'll do it thanks we'll
finish up next week we've never done a
two-part NCL it's a good one uh
any sponsorship yeah so so then I'm
going to take the current spawn
description that I've popped so popping
is like a Pez dispenser I've pulled it
out of the Pez machine and I'm gonna use
it I'm gonna eat it now
so what popping's like yeah
just like a peasant yeah Japan spent
that's how I describe it
have a lot of popping Pez dispensers
when you were a kid yeah did you not
popping
yeah because you pull the thing down it
pops out they did not pop up no was it
not much oh it's so precious out you
have like some automatic fire Pez
dispensers well what do they say tomato
tomato
I don't know what you guys called it I'm
English I'm British right so it's
tomato
yeah
anyway
um so I'm gonna take the
uh the ship spawn closet manager that uh
we have here
and I am going to then take the
current spawn description that I've
taken out and then I'm going to make a
another look variable because I'm going
to make multiple spawn requests here
request
it's called l
[Music]
uh so I'm gonna make multiple spawn
requests so what I need to do is uh
merge them all into one because they can
only the information can
like this node will over overwrite every
time that input so I have to make it
local so then I can make the more call
back on one so I don't have to make like
a thousand callbacks
[Music]
foreign
request
this one is going to be called something
like NPCs
um
keep buying
ships guys
yeah cool so that's the sport that's the
spawn request for the NPCs
let me check all this is right so I pop
them yep I then take the managers
and then I pass it in cool right nice
nice
so this this will spawn it so next up I
need to make sure that I know when the
NPCs are here so I'm going to right
click and get another call back and it's
going to be on the spawn closet spawn
which is this
and essentially all this one's gonna do
is send event to Mission instance
like that
and it's going to send the modular
request again of AI spawned because this
time it's spawning a
[Music]
an actual NPC like uh yeah so I'm going
to send that straight back to the um the
thing then from there that is that's the
ship the occupied ship spawner I believe
done so that should spawn ship and spawn
all the AI on it for me so the next
thing I need to do is now actually build
the mission I've not been building the
mission for the past 30 minutes
foreign
no no it's it's
there's a there's a thing people often
wonder you continue to wear all that
there's a thing people often wonder why
we do a show on this or do a show on
that and the number one criteria that I
have personally being in year nine as I
am here is I ask myself would anyone
else do this would BioWare do this as a
piece of promotional material would
would Activision or or anyone else and
if the answer is no I'm instantly
intrigued by it which is one of the
things I love about one of the many
things I love about star citizens I
think one of the like the when I see
them ever make one they have a highly
polished like GUI for their tools and
you know they all work flawlessly and
it's like we build our tools for what we
need now they don't have to look pretty
they just have to kind of they don't
actually look like the thing that
they're showing either it's always been
a it's always a manufacturer thing what
I liked about what I liked about this
this idea of of having you do this is to
show we you know we did that we've been
talking about the the mission manager
and the verbs and all this stuff for
years now and I wanted to show that you
haven't done any you're not programming
here the the this the the the work to
this point
has been about building a CIS building a
modular system that runs through flow
graph that runs through all these you
know neat tools like Robo Hasty and
anything to automate a lot of the
programming work so that then we can
democratize the process of mission
creation to dozens and dozens of other
developers so designers who are
typically not programmers nope can come
in and just focus on being creative once
they once they get the the handle the
understanding of of a select few verbs
they understand the syntax necessary
this goes into this this goes into this
you know there's a learning curve I'm
not going to sit here and say it's not a
learning curve we're demonstrating the
learning curve here but this is how we
scale yeah this is how we go from well
you know if it only took if it took you
four years to make X number of missions
how are you going to make how are you
going to populate you know another star
system with all these missions now
you're going to populate you know 10
star systems while he's missing this is
how we do it the the the game
development is exponent Central it's a
lot of the early years are is is in you
know building this framework this this
groundwork this Foundation any more
synonyms I can think of uh this thing
under the thing
where it allows you to then iterate
faster and more efficiently as you go
forward and that's one of the reasons
we've been telling the story of the
mission manager anything over in this
assumption over the this last year
because it having been here for as long
as I have it's exciting I'm starting to
feel like we're there I'm starting to
feel like we're at that point now where
where development can begin to scale up
and we can start making things faster
than you know we have at any period in
the past
you know barring things like
you know uh long-term persistence I
think you know pulling that Foundation
out from under us and having to start
over but
so I've been talking through this we
haven't explained this whole part what
are we looking at right here uh it
doesn't matter it doesn't concern them
it doesn't concern them
no I am not talking about spaceships
Kenny what's a spaceship I don't know
never heard of it uh we I've currently
survived I've gone in I've started
building this you didn't actually drink
out of your water oh just open the lid
this is my life uh yeah so I've I've
started building the main mission so
what I've done here is once again I've
created a pre in it because the pre in
it will stop this from properly like
running until the player gets to the
location because there's certain things
that I need to find when you get there
uh so making sure that
making sure that you don't
that normally loads is pretty vital to
the mission actually working uh what I'm
doing here is again that's just set that
up this is the module I just made this
is the occupied ship spawner
um and I'm passing in the location it
needs to care about the ships I want it
to spawn and the NPCs to populate and
now I'm so everything you spent the
first 20 minutes doing yeah is in that
box right there is now in that box and
this is how other designers build
modular missions is I build a lot of
these and then they just do that and
plug plug everything in and then my
stuff just
kind of just does a lot of heavy lifting
for them so they don't have to worry
uh I'll worry about it so so do you I
can't spell subdue so you know I know
you're the one who tries to college
today yeah I know but it's like you say
it makes sense to be called that it
doesn't mean I can spell it
subdue tag it okay cool so this is going
to create an objective that the player
can see
then I'm gonna actually Mark some things
to the play knows where to go
and I'm going to use the location
obviously I put here so it's actually
just on the location so what I'm doing
is I'm going on to my Star Wars tool and
I'm grabbing the strings that we that we
that way you didn't do any of this is me
that I've made uh
that I've made here there we go and I'm
putting in so I'm gonna I'm gonna so
then we have some sort of extra options
on some of these like nodes so I'm gonna
display the distance here to make sure
you know just how far you're going and
it's not just a marker though in space
um
yep so I'm gonna do that and then I'm
gonna do a set subjective this oh my God
type display disk
I can't spell what do you mean Jared has
been coding this whole time I'm checking
his work
it's called the buddy system
all the rubber duck there's this thing
in programming where
um if you can't figure your logic out
you talk to a rubber dusk duck on your
desk and vocalizing out loud it'll help
you solve your problem
so you remember rubber duck I call that
David
you know what mine's called David as
well
you've made me let me try to follow
David
uh objectively okay so next up to the
objective display is a fancy word for
saying hood uh so this is what's going
to display on your hood there you go and
I am going to also make it managed per
player so I don't always want to show
the hood I might want to control it next
up I'm going to create a oh my God a
sub-objective
so a sub-objective is going to parent to
the objective I've just made boom
and this one's going to be
called locate probably objective
or Target ship location it's got OB
J cool
this one is going to be hidden from you
because I don't want you to see it until
you get to the location
and I'm going to take the long string
that we built that we built stop they
didn't do anything earlier I did
short
so locate shot among and then I need to
make another mission objective display
but I'm lazy so I'm not going to retake
the node and I'm just going to take this
one from above
and I'm going to get the hood for locate
and do that with it however this one I
need to not respect its inherited
visibility what that means is that
because this is parented to this and
this is uh
this is not hidden but this one is this
display would likely not show unless
both of these were visible so I'm going
to tell it not to respect its parents
and just go off the rails and do what I
tell it to
uh cool
uh next stop
just play four players cool and next up
I'm going to show are the objective
display for one of these for the players
because I want them to see this one
so this is going to be the target ship
location because again I'm managing it
per player but I'm also telling it not
to respect by default it's going to be
off so I need to tell it to be on for
All Mission players and we have things
called Magic variables uh and that just
means that I type them in and as long as
I spell it right uh code links it up
which I spelled it wrong instantly it's
Mission players
how many how many bugs do you think are
attributed just to typos
when it's me quite a review
I do it all the time I'm really bad at
it
but we tried it we try to when we
identify this somewhere that you can
type stuff in we try to fix it because
we know it's not a good way of of like
handling this sort of stuff
uh cool right
nice so that is
that's that's the um
that's that's the first part sorry
that's the first part
that's the second first part that's the
second first part next up I need to get
a reference to the action area where I'm
going to spawn them so I'm gonna do a uh
well first I need to filter the action
area
uh set
come on let's set action area filter
pull pull
this uh this node so action area filter
exists for a reason
and it's because an action area is a
volume in anywhere that will detect when
things have overlapped with it um
and the issue that we used to have and
again this is it was like hey there's a
problem here and then sort of fixing it
the issue we used to have is that um we
could detect everything when I was
building Siege of horizon I used to
crash because my action area detected a
sprig of mint that was on the
bartender's drink and to my action area
um so this filter thing I've requested
quite heavily and we got it so that I
can make sure that mint doesn't enter my
action area and break my game
um
so I'm gonna filter for anything that's
human controlled which means that I
control it you control it if you who is
watching is a human
get some Epson chat for sprig of mint
um Mission area so now I need to get the
mission location action area so I
filtered it so I have to filter it
before I get it or else the filter
doesn't apply so I've filtered it and
now I've got got it so it's gonna
um get it we've now got all the [ __ ]
arrows
no
um
yeah so that will now filter down my
action area which now means I get to
make how much force you might have got
20 minutes left my god
um all right we'll come back next week
good afternoon yeah
um so now I need to
wonderful thing about scl
said it never ends there's always
another Friday
it's always another Friday I have to
fill Elliot
I have to make missions which one of us
in the worst boat
yours your videos work they go out
South burn those are rare
I
want to say something so badly
okay uh
uh right so I'm making the action area
call back for on entered and iron exit
for again human controlled things which
is good but I still need to do a form of
filtering so
um
on exit I'm going to tell the player to
come back to the area however I'm going
to I don't want to tell them to come
back if the target's already been found
because if the target's found they might
as well just always have that marker
because they're always going to know
that information
um so I need to make a entity tracker
which where I will use a valid callback
to know if the target's in here so this
is going to be called
um
Target
cup
isn't tracker empty so this is me
checking to see if the target has been
put in this variable
and then I'm going to check to see if
the person who's come in here is a
mission player so um
if it is empty and the entered exited
person the person who's left
then I'm gonna add them back to an
objective marker so I'm going to add
them back the extra density to the
subdue Target marker so that will be the
marker that's like in the search area
who then when they come back in the area
actually so I don't have to retype I'm
just going to copy these two notes
so when they come back in the area I'm
going to make sure that the the target
once again is valid and then I'm gonna
do a bunch cleanup so remove
objective marker
move object where's my node remove I bet
it's remove player from yeah it is cool
uh so this is gonna remove because
because they might have I mean even if
they've exited to come back I always
need to make sure that this doesn't
exist on them this marker so I'm going
to remove it I'm also then going to show
objective display for players
this is going to turn HUD on so I'm
going to put the subdue one on for the
entered entity so the person no I'm
going to turn this one off because this
is the one that's already on their
screen yes yes yes yes
uh G Kenny says Jared can you do a nice
ASC about uh issue Council uh we did
it was super popular
everybody was really happy with it
and and and the comments were really
positive
foreign
objective
um the one that's the locate because
you're in the area now so you need to
find them again this is only if the
target hasn't already been found unless
you want that attack track so I am going
to check the Target location and do that
for the incident to see true true if
you're there by far and that's all cool
so this is gonna play against it the
market to go there goes away the hood
that was there goes away and it comes up
with locate and then it will
show the objective in the mobile glass
as well so you'll see a locate locate
void dude and then kill him
next up is an event so this event is one
that's going to be that I've sent so if
you remember I talked about those
modular events in my other module that's
I'm gonna register here and listen for
it because you have to listen to them or
else they can just get sent into the
void and you never hear them
uh oh my whatever I put the modular
they're all over modular events Marshall
events where's Mission modules Mission
modules module emissions my God my
naming thing is horrible modular events
uh AI spawn aiming conventions
they have undone so many aspects of many
many games over the years
I like I would I would wager that
most
many I don't know the most but a not
insignificant number of AAA games have
had naming convention revamps during the
course of their during the course of
their development just this okay we got
it we got to fix this like we were
naming it it worked when the game was
this big and now the game's this big and
we've gotta we've got a we've got to
completely redo the the structure and
then some technical director leaves and
somebody else comes in and goes oh this
naming convention is garbage and they
have to go through and they redo it
again
naming conventions are
I have many traumas in my life yeah
naming conventions are one of them you
want to know the what I mean apart from
naming professional worst thing I've
done is not linked a node like that and
then booted the game and then like
waited for its boot got in and then been
like I didn't link my nodes yes that's
even worse now I wanna I wanna stress
that the reason that is so bad like oh
well that doesn't seem so bad it's
because in its raw state in the Raw
state where you know you're not on the
you know the big servers anything it
takes about 20 to 30 minutes to boot a
local version of the server and client
so when you have done this part and then
you go to boot your local to see to see
if it's working to the point and you
realize you've wasted that 20 to 30
minutes you were waiting
because of a single line missing
that's why that's so tragic yeah and the
worst part is if you pull like your lead
coder over because it isn't working
you've not noticed that line maybe
because you like zoomed all the way out
and the lines are like tiny and you're
showing it over a bit logic he's like
well you didn't you didn't we'll start
over then you screw Zoom all the way in
and he's like ah and you're like ah
thanks Dave one little tiny line one
little control One Mono quarter inch
audio cable
um so next up
I am going to set up
um the object the objective marker
that's on the ship however because of
the whole thing where I want it to be
scanned for I'm gonna make this
objective Market exist but don't know
but like not truly exist because I give
it a null item it means that you won't
see it in game
um until I tell it to show and I'm going
to tell it to show
after uh after you found it so this is
again going back to the modules we build
I'm going to place another one down here
uh that is called find object battery
radar another one we've built which
basically you pass in the ship that you
care about so the AI spawned you pass in
the objective that has the marker on it
because it will turn it on for you and I
just leave this to true so what this
will do is it will detect every way you
can find a ship via Radar Now everywhere
you can find a ship via a radar is
passive scan which is it just pops up on
your little radar on your ship there's
something called blob and then there's
actual actual scanning
um cool
so uh
[Music]
show objective
so then okay cool right nice so next
thing I I'm doing here is I am just
making sure that the objective is is
definitely existing for the mission
place
um in case there's been any way you can
sort of get around it which is that so
uh what what you saw missed here was I
am checking the AI spond and I'm
checking to see if it has a tag of ship
because then I know that the thing has
spawned is a ship because if you
remember when I built the module I used
the modular AI spawn for both the ship
and the NPCs so um
so that's why I've done that so I can
filter it because then I know if it's
not a ship and the only other thing it
could be is the is an actual like NPC AI
That's on board it
so I'm going to build another separate
entity tracker here which is going to do
a um
like a global sort of collect so this is
going to be um
all occupiers
so this is going to track all of them
and then I'm going to do something
called compare
um
a compared bullion and I'm going to
check for a bullying that I'm going to
make which is kind of going into that
like how do all the designers use this
how are they going to pass all this
information I've got 10 minutes left
um how are they going to track all this
information oh
thank you don't worry about the 10
minutes
um yeah how are they going to track all
this information like how are they going
to pass it in how they're going to tell
me what they want
um
and this is this is sort of pre-prepping
for what I know in my mind I'm going to
give them to wise so I'm going to do a
thing where I detect if they've given me
a Target tag which means they've they've
said this specific AI I want to be the
target
um compared to say grab random
um
it's different when you have to talk
through the entire thing isn't it yeah
yeah it's a lot quicker when I don't
have to tell anyone what I'm doing
um
but this is fun right we're all having
fun no I'm I'm very happy I'm very happy
this is exactly what I had hoped that
stream would be that you're doing a good
job hey
uh so the next thing I'm doing is I'm
checking that thing that I give the
designers power to so I checked to see
if an identifier tag which is what a
designer can set has the tag of targets
then I know that they've specifically
given me a Target which is this stuff so
what's going to happen is every AI that
spawns is going to pass through here and
it's going to constantly go through and
if this has been set to true it's gonna
check every single one of them is this
got the identifier tag of Target and
then if it has
and then if it has that's where I can
sorry one second that's where I can go
through and make sure that I pass the
correct
AI into the mission
so uh Adams is to not proximity tracker
it's gone I've lost my node
you know what I haven't lost this right
there
friendship is still the best ship in
Star Citizen
hear that John crew
it's friendship you know I got murdered
by dark law on live he just murdered me
and I checked his stream and he was just
sat there like this
like it was the easiest thing ever and
he killed an entire Sig Dev team and
just like then what like walked away
third floor is pretty good though
player or morally no what player okay
not morally because then we popped in
his channels like you know you just
killed me and I'm I'm not gonna try a
Scottish accent or whatever but he was
like I didn't know
dark law you're a jerk
and you can clip that and use it on your
stream
cool
right uh so I'm going to set an object
so I've I've added the target which the
air spawn to the Target list and now I'm
going to make a variable uh to also
store the target as an object and Target
oh
voila
and then I am likely going to also
convert I think the target to
no yeah I'll do that yeah
yeah yeah cool yeah yeah sorry I'm
trying to think through what I'm doing
so
next up knocked out so
if and because it's subdue it means that
I need to track if they've been it's not
without some dude
uh I'm gonna make a call back on the
entity tracker and that's because right
now the only way to subdue somebody is
to knock them out we don't have that
exactly the additional Bounty Hunter
stuff put them in stasis or put
handcuffs on them stuff like that yeah
so one of the challenges of making
missions for a game that's still in
active development is you know you make
them for the tools and features that are
available now
yes we will yeah
it's uh sometimes it's like you're
shoehorning things in and sometimes you
most of the time it's you're always just
trying to get that feeling for what it's
going to end up like because you want it
to you want it to play as close as it
can
and then fix up when it comes to later
um so
uh so admission so what I'm doing here
is that you've knocked the target out so
void dude had a tag it on him to tell
you to go knock him out uh so now I need
to remove that marker because the
delivery marker is going to take over
and um
tell you to go deliver the guy right you
don't want to still have a fine boy do
Marker exactly and they're knocked out
in your ship uh and then what I'm doing
here is I'm adding the mission as the
owner of void dude because uh we have we
have a lot of cleanup things in our game
so obviously
clean [ __ ] out the world that doesn't
need to exist
um and when you kill an AI it does that
and if you was to leave the area the AI
should be cleaned up
um but because this is a mission
critical item we don't want void to be
cleaned up we want him to stay
uh so next up again another module the
this is one of the delivery modules that
I think was about
20 minutes into that run I did on the
ISC about 20 minutes into the version
they saw true and the version I had to
sit through was like 45.
what can I say I like what I do
you know it's it's
despite what's his name whoever was I
don't remember now you know uh
these shows the the reason I can sit
back the reason I can I can literally
kick back and put my feet up
my VHS shoes and why not is because
Elliot is one of those people
that I trust implicitly he's proven
himself
time and time again he knows his stuff
uh not not spelling but this isn't this
isn't a spelling bee here
um and I don't have to hold his hand I
don't have to guide him through the
conversation through anything else I can
just sit here and I can let him steer
the ship which is nice every once in a
while hey y'all
I just say nice things about people it
happens
I could feel the heat radiating from
over there just saying nice things Jared
said didn't say nice things
so uh what I've done here I've just
filled in some of the nodes that I need
to fill in on the delivery uh module
that I'm going to call and I'm doing a
thing called stop proximity tracker
because I want when you go to the ship
the issue is well the issue that I see
which is that whole imperfect situation
that exists is you'll know where they
are roughly so you can kind of guess
what floor to go to and that makes for a
makes for the experience that I don't
want you to have I don't want you to
know and go straight to them because
that's boring I want it to be somewhat
of a challenge for you because you've
got brains right you can think for
yourself so find them use your eyes
wait the views and opinions of La Maltby
do not represent those of cloud Imperium
games or what what
uh
I'm just a designer a games designer I
clicked controllers uh Jared just said
all the other developers are incompetent
no
I said being able to
communicate effectively on a live TV
show without your head exploding from
anxiety and brain detritus it's not a
skill that every human being in the
world has
I barely have it
there was such and go there for a little
while
towards the beginning like there's
there's a moment about like seven
minutes in we're at Eva it happens is
that why you held my heart yes so now
you know how nervous because you felt
the sweat I felt it I felt this way
[Applause]
so uh what I've just done quickly here
is I've made a modular so that we have
this event called the modular Mission
objective event and this is basically
have has this module I've built
completed its core objective so in this
case this is going to be the delivery
objective calling back telling me it's
done so I'm gonna check just to make
sure the players completed it and then
after that I'm going to complete the
mission because you've done your work
there that's it right
uh
[Music]
uh complete nice good easy real easy one
next up uh we have the ship so uh the
ship spawned we have a ship I've
converted it to a ship reference purely
so I can get this call back which is on
object centered this allows me to know
when you the player has entered uh the
ship and then from here I can do that do
the thing where I take all your markers
away
and um
like let you use your eyes to go and
hunt for them however I'll give you that
hand of the proximity tracker
um
to sort of guide you through
it's a place to remove
entered person nice and I'm going to
remove you from the target ship location
set mission
objective display so now I'm gonna put
on an objective display which is telling
you to
subdue uh void dude uh yep so I need to
find my string for it give me two
seconds which is this boom so this is
going to say like locate and subdue
um Target name which would then
dynamically resolve to avoid dude
take my Scented Markers away
when I was in grade school we had a we
had a
we had a pencil machine you put a
quarter in you turn it and give you two
pencils and the pencil smelled and they
smelled like different things like fruit
smells you had to pay for pencils
it's a different time it's capitalism I
was just when pencils was just invented
chalkboards before right
I'm a bit old but not that old you won't
be seeing me on the next SEO no
yeah come back and finish this you come
back finish this then we gotta play it
and see how well you did oh God
somebody remembers the smelly pencils
right it's not just me
uh let's see
all right well actually
we're at about five o'clock so where's a
good place to wrap this up I literally
after I finish this now done all right
so what did we just do where are we at
now so I've you're on so when you get to
the ship now I am going to take away the
markers I'm gonna put a hood display
that says uh please find
um
to subdue him and then I'm going to
start a proximity tracker the proximity
tracker is just how close am I to them
so when you within 10 meters I'll mark
them
um and this can be played with so like
if 10 minutes isn't right I'll open to
15 so on and so forth
um and then there's a bunch of next
steps after this but we're nearly there
yeah so what so what we'll do what are
you doing next Friday
Akin uh hopefully hopefully from
Manchester I'm off home for uh for a few
days but we'll have to work that out all
right so let's we'll see if we do next
Friday whatever bring it back and then
play the mission because I really like
to get in there and and see this work
yep yeah yeah same all right meet you
over that camera
hi everybody so that's been Star Citizen
LIVE Game Dev Mission maker uh I'm not
the mission maker he's the mission maker
that was Elliot a good job man it's
we've been doing Game Dev shows for six
years or so now we've never actually you
know it's impossible to make anything
for Star Citizen in an hour yeah uh but
I think it's always important to
demonstrate process to show uh
especially this the big victory of of
this system is that it has opened the
process of making missions to people
other than programmers you know there's
this there's this perception there's
this mentality that you have to be a
programmer in order to make games yeah
you don't no certain aspects of it sure
yes but you know part of the game
development is making these tools making
making subsumption making Robo Hesse
making you know making Star Wars so that
uh just you know other people who can
unders who can follow instructions and
can and can learn syntax yeah uh
understand you know it can build these
things and that's how we scale up to the
uh to the big immersive Precision
Universe yeah yeah uh
before we go
we're gonna raid somebody uh we haven't
rated anybody in a while uh CLX which is
a maker of custom PCS are actually
um in the process if I'm not mistaken
they should be live now are are
currently building a PC for atmo Esports
which is you know one of the Esports
organizations in the in the Star Citizen
Universe uh they're going to be on with
our own uh Jake uh let me check the name
Jake Bradley who is apparently somebody
who works here he is on that stream
um say hi say hi to Jake
um hi Jake and uh yeah take care
everybody we'll see you here next week
bye
