## Transcript

in looking at the way that our teams are
structured especially after the Montreal
merger with turbulence we decided to
combine
uspu as well as Montreal pu into napu
napu stands for North American
persistent Universe Napo is the
recruitment of three different cities in
order to kind of create a super team
that gives them a lot of coding
Firepower as well as design firepowered
napu is really a collection of people
from Austin from LA from Montreal we're
all just getting together to try to make
some
amazing new features for Star Citizen pu
so that includes physicalized cargo
in-game shops and newer features that
we're looking into such as exploration
we're working mostly currently cargo and
things regarding that we recently
finished work on the hall sea an APU was
formed in order to work on larger
feature sets for Star Citizen so that
those features have the time and
resources required to deliver them at
the Quality level that we want to see in
Apu includes several Engineers
production and QA we have six different
programmers actually we have a few that
are in LA and then we have a few more in
Austin right now that includes James
Mitch Kevin myself as well as Preston on
production and and Alicia in QA
did I say everyone we have two Matthew
and Emma that are here in Montreal yes I
think I got them all so at this point a
lot of what we're working on is still in
the design phase I would say in the
technical design and planning phase but
yeah there's a lot of tdd like technical
design document going on preparing the
the feature and all the parts there's a
lot of work in that area
the North American persistent Universe
team are currently at the Forefront to
the next major evolution of cargo Hangar
and related inventory systems and as
their work begins to enter the Pu over
the next three to six to nine months and
beyond all building to what we hope will
collectively become a true cargo career
we here at ISC well we didn't want to
wait to begin telling the story as much
like the engineering and Resource
Management systems of the eupu team this
work promises to be utterly
transformative to the overall Star
Citizen experience
so these next two shows while they're
going to be a bit different than normal
that's because we're not going to have
anything to Dazzle your eyeballs with
just yet yes the ISC gameplay capture
team as great as they are well we're
going to let them take a break this week
as we let members of the napu team take
you through the design and intention of
their current work in a two-part special
we're calling design brief cargo career
foreign

Apu and the foreseeable future is going
to include features such as freight
elevators and instance hangers as well
as persistent hangers bright elevators
are one of the biggest changes to Cargo
that we've seen in the entire history of
the game they bring the feature from
being something that's somewhat magical
to something that's physical it adds
friction but also a gameplay experience
around hauling Cargo in our game this
one addition I think is going to change
not just cargo but also the way that we
interact with everything else in the
game inventory player items purchases
ship items it's a fundamental change to
how players are going to deal with the
world
freight elevators are going to be
implemented as an access point inside of
player hangers where the player can
interface with cargo to get it ready to
put it on their ship and you'll use a
kiosk to interact with the freight
platform in order to call things up from
your inventory or to put things into
your inventory the way that the freight
elevators are going to be implemented is
actually using the same technology as we
use for the cargo grids and the ships
players will be using their tractor
beams in order to detach things from the
platform and then haul it onto their
ship and vice versa they'll be using the
tractor beams in order to detach things
from the cargo grids and put them onto
the freight platform I think that this
is going to make the whole experience
feel a lot more tactile and organic as
well as there's a lot of fun and
interesting gameplay around just how you
stack things how you sequence them take
a group of people decide how you're
actually going to load things together
it's like that time that you go and move
with a U-Haul and your friends you got
to figure out where to put the couch but
in game it's going to be figuring out
where do we take that big box where do
we put the the ship items where do we
put the guns and try to sequence it in a
way that's both optimal as well as I
think fun we don't just want to have the
feature you know exist and avoid really
what we want to try and do is work with
the whole scope of the game to support
cargo so this is something for outposts
for ugf where we want to look at how do
we really take advantage of cargo in
these spaces however it does mean that
the Outpost will also support the same
manual loading process that the hangers
and those other locations use so not
only are you participating in cargo you
know in a hangar in a station but out in
the verse as well at an outpost
and while freight elevators will be
available throughout locations in the
Precision Universe much of the work
involved in manually loading and
unloading your vehicles will always
involve your hangers which presented the
team with some unique challenges to
address and overcome starting with the
next iteration of instanced hangers
instanced hangers solve a particular
problem how do we have people spinning
an extended period of time in their
Hangar loading cargo now that we've
added these Freight platforms but also
allow the locations to have traffic
coming in and out of the landing zones
what we're doing here is decoupling the
access to a hanger from the occupancy
and all that really means is that we can
dynamically create these hangers at
runtime and they're kind of set aside
for players to spend time inside of
without getting too much into it right
you're going to have a personal space
we're just looking at ways that a lot
more players can do this simultaneously
we don't want to have a big choke point
of everybody trying to load their ships
and unload and all trying to do that in
the same space so we have instance
hangers as a way to to put you in an
area where you can feel comfortable you
can take the time that you want to load
your or unload your cargo and you know
really engage in that system the way
that you choose and so you can actually
have your personal space to deal with
cargo inside a hanger and depending on
your ship you know they'll be different
different situations and different
locations for that but the thing with
this one is that when you leave things
gonna basically go away once you want to
leave you'll just make a request to ATC
and the hangar will move into place
we'll open up the doors and you'll be
able to leave and then the same thing
when Landing you make a request to ATC
the system will allocate the space for
you open the hanger and you can land for
the players it will seem seamless but
underneath the hood the system itself is
going to be maintaining a representation
of where all the players are what
requirements are needed without having a
bottleneck for players who are actually
just trying to play the game otherwise
and then we have persistent hangers
persistent hangers are kind of an
evolution of instant hangers and really
what it is is our first step towards
Real Player ownership in the game Beyond
ships the cool things that you will be
able to put your stuff in it come back
to it and it's still going to be there
it's just whatever the player wants to
keep inside their hanger that's their
home they can just leave them lie around
they can arrange them however they want
be it weapons or cargo or dead corpses
or whatever very very long term I have
no clue of any dates or anything but
you'll be able to customize it and
upgrade it so it becomes bigger you can
have bigger ships in them and maybe at
some point even having them like at
distant location you could buy a second
one for now it's going to really be on
your own location it's persistent to you
and your character and you can invite
friends to your Hangar you can load up
your ship and you can take the hall from
your mission you know out of your ship
and distribute it to your buddies so
Persistence of hangers is really
important this is going to be developed
more in the future and we're going to
use the same technology that we're using
to build this for other things in the
game such as player abs and it's a real
I think exciting way for the players to
feel like they have a more permanent
place in the game that they can call
their own
I
I can't help but notice the ISC gameplay
capture team snuck some conceptual
visualization in there after all what
can I say they love what they do
and of course I'd be remiss if I didn't
say that everything you're hearing about
today is the current intention of the
design team at the time that we filmed
this now as with all things you see and
hear about on any ISE it's always a work
in progress and May and often will
continue to evolve as development
progresses and concepts are tested
now so far in our design brief cargo
career we've talked about how you'll
move and store your boxes so let's find
out more about what happens inside those
boxes going forward
[Music]
with 320 we introduced a new packing
system that allows us to use a larger
set of box sizes right now that includes
one Su 2 4 8 16 24 and 32. however with
this new version of cargo coming out
subsequently we're gonna be adding the
ability to have what we call inventory
container boxes inventory actually plays
a big part of cargo as well when you
look at the sheer scope of number of
boxes and you know a number of weapons
and armor and FPS entities that we have
in our game we really want to make sure
that not only is Cargo physicalized but
that inventory has a proper location in
place as well if you go to Port Tressler
and you hit I you'll bring up the player
inventory screen and you'll see that
okay I have my access to Port Tressler
inventory no matter where I am standing
in this station that's going to go away
this is very important because what it
means is it gives the players a way to
transfer in a very clean and effective
way all of the loose items that you
collect during game play
a big change that's coming up is going
to be having properties for those boxes
so that could be something like a box
that's fragile
or a box that could be Radioactive
or that needs to be kept cool
the other thing we're looking at with
cargo and cargo boxes is the ability to
store large items in your cargo boxes
this could be anything from a ship
weapon uh to even smaller Vehicles like
gray cats that way when you're going
with your friends you're going to do a
long haul across the verse you can have
these larger boxes filled to the brim
with as many ship weapons as your ship
is going to carry anything that you
think you want to take with you and hold
on to now you can put them in an
inventory container box snap them into
the cargo grid and haul it into your
ship additionally you'll be able to take
those to the freight Platforms in order
to put them into your inventories
so it gives a kind of universal way to
haul things around in the game as well
as a way for players to be able to
Pirate player inventories now
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
now that you have these Goods that are
locked up together in these inventory
containers it just takes a tractor beam
in order to carry them off so it gives a
lot of gameplay possibilities for us to
have with these loose items
a lot of these things will tie into
missions and where you decide to place
them on your ship so we're really trying
to make sure with cargo it's not just a
wide system but that we're actually
adding these kind of elements to help
further gameplay missions and purpose
[Music]
you guys had the week
on talking
it's intense and none of this stuff is
ready to show yet
you want a week off
so weird anyway
no no weird stuff for cargo grid
back to the spaceship
[Music]
we have some additional changes that
we're going to be making to the cargo
grids that allow them to have any sized
item attached into them at the moment we
have effectively one kinds of items that
attach to the cargo grids those are the
cargo boxes and they all have a similar
size step on the dimension what I just
mean by that is they're all what we call
one seu length multiples on each side
we're going to have it to where anything
can attach to the cargo grid as long as
it's a physical item in the game
anything that you can grab with that
tractor beam that can reasonably snap
into a place will be able to snap into
place and this is a requirement just to
satisfying the inventory changes that
we're making now that you won't have
this kind of magical access but it also
I think broadens the horizons about what
your cargo grid and all of your ships
can be used for I think it'll also open
up a lot of fun gameplay around just
figuring out how to arrange change all
these things in a way that works well
so yeah that's part one of our talk
about design brief cargo career next
week we'll be back with changes to
vehicles and location inventory larger
cargo item support kiosk changes the
item bank and even unique item recovery
so come on back and get the full scope
of things next week
and is testing and fixing continues on
Alpha 320 over on the PTU with the
latest additions to Arena commander and
the Precision Universe heading your way
you can check out the

launcher for details on when that
releases for inside Star Citizen I'm
Jared Huckabee thanks for letting us
share the process of game development
with you and for indulging Us in these
mostly visual free design brief shows
and we'll see you all here for part two
next week
