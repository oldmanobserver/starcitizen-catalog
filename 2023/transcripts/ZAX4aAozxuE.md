it's been a long time since I've been in
front of a camera so this is a new
experience for me fresh one but yeah I'm
enjoying it this is going to do better
you are great
Graham he's an old town he knows what
he's doing
[Music]
he didn't notice you there
[Music]
So today we're talking about resonance
within the Claudius tool what's Claudius
oh it's a question okay Claudius is our
new audio tool that brings together all
the different audio functions into one
place so the sound designers can access
everything they need without going
through needless code requests all the
time my favorite thing about Claudius is
the fact that I won't have to jump into
so many different tools and programs to
get in-game and get the sound sounding
the way that I want them to and the way
that I Envision them in my head we did a
whole thing on a citizen car a few years
ago you should go watch it I'll just win
a much more natural on that camera when
I'm not looking
one of the ways in which we're looking
to improve the audio experience of Star
Citizen is to find ways to better meet
the players expectations of what is
being heard in the game world we already
create the sounds that you would expect
for objects and interactions in the game
and glue them together with Reverb and
effects but we can always go further our
latest piece of tech within the Claudius
editor is resonance which allows us to
take a game event that is either loud or
particularly high sound pressure and
make other elements of the game respond
in much the same way as you would expect
in the real world
resonance put simply is the sensitivity
of objects to vibration and in terms of
our Tech it's the sound that they make
as a result we're aiming to fill a gap
that currently exists with certain
things not dynamically responding at
least in an audible sense to player
import and events transpiring in world
we want to add another layer to the
soundscape that just sprinkles a little
more life into it and makes it just that
little bit more real you're there you're
experiencing it our new tech allows us
to quickly create resonances around
points in the world in response to game
events that can then be reflected by the
objects and geometry around those points
we can add a resonance driver node in
Claudius and set the size of its sphere
of influence and also how long it takes
Decay to nothing
we can then add resonator nodes to any
audio object that we see fit when the
resonator is caught in the sphere of
influence of the driver during gameplay
we use the resulting output to decide
how loudly the object should resonate
what we're saying is we're taking game
events in the world and we're trying to
make the world around you respond in a
much more realistic way to what you're
doing so if you're firing a weapon next
to a window you'd expect it to go or
something like that you know a master
panel sheet panel that kind of thing we
can also set frequencies for both the
driver and the resonator and make them
respond only if the driver hits the
resonant frequency of the resonator
so basically at the frequency of a
driver is changing it might hit a
certain frequency that excites an object
much more than it does at other
frequencies even with a simple example
there's already a greater sense of cause
and effect the props around you feel
connected to your actions and you feel
more immersed as a result
foreign
this being implemented via Claudius in a
straightforward visual logic based
scripting way means that getting your
sounds in-game and working is just that
much quicker
there are so many interweaving systems
that play on the engine side that it
usually can prove a challenge to get the
desired outcome just from the resonator
and resonance knowns alone we can manage
quick tweaks to dial in the exact kind
of sounds we want to and we're having it
happen live and in context as we go
claudius's design philosophy is to put
workflow first and with this in mind the
resonance Tech makes it easy to take a
location or ship and populate it with
the kind of responses you hear happening
around you in real life
the potential here is large so having a
tool that makes it easy becomes
incredibly important the underlying Tech
is designed to give the designers
everything they need to implement we're
not relying on repeated code support
requests to get this kind of dynamism in
for our sounds
no one knows what you need to achieve
the result you're aiming for in your
head better than yourself and that can
take time and iteration but here we have
all the tools to do that by ourselves so
now we can take a location look around
it and think about what we'd expect to
hear when for example a weapon is fired
and quickly add the mark up to the game
to make it do what we expect here we can
see a few candidates metal Locker doors
a waste bin
empty cans some windows
containers
by adding audio components to these
objects or adding audio entities to the
world markup we can easily create their
resonant responses
adding these resonances brings variety
and realism to the soundscape
thank you
so we're no longer just hearing weapons
and Reverb we're now hearing the objects
and materials around the player too we
can use the tech to support visual
physical movements or even to imply them
using audio alone we can listen to the
resonances in isolation to understand
what's being added here
thank you this system is hooked into our
propagation Tech which allows sounds to
respect paths through rooms and doorways
to reach the listener normally the
player but in this case rather than
ensuring that what you hear respects the
propagation paths within the world we
use the system to decide whether for
example a resonance driver in one room
should excite a resonator in another so
basically if someone fires a weapon
within a room the objects in that room
will vibrate differently to any objects
that are outside that room as with all
Tech we have things to consider from a
design perspective there isn't going to
be a one-size-fits-all system take for
example Uranus ship you might want to
let the players experience a huge impact
from the missile is it given you'd
expect the ship in its internal contents
to resonate when that happens and this
is perfect for that but what about
continuous resonances in a ship we may
want to use the system much more
sparingly in these cases in order to
avoid fatigue and focus more on the
transient resonances as they convey more
important information to the player much
like a computer the system needs rules
to govern its output so design needs to
inform the system how it should be
behaving resonance can become more of an
event to convey excitement and useful
information
it should serve the experience and could
help make scenes pop from an audio
perspective
while we have the option of using
propagation to ensure that resonances
don't travel through walls or geometry
we can see that there are cases where we
may want it to do just that a ship
receiving an impact from a huge missile
would have vibrations resonating through
its structure which in turn would
resonate its contents by vibrating the
ship and the objects around the player
the impact becomes much more visceral
and feels like a direct threat to the
player rather than an event that just
happened to some other part of the ship
the player's experience of the impact
can then be more reflective of the
Damage Done to their ship
[Music]
foreign
so this is cool because if you have a
huge impact of hitting your ship yeah if
you're in the cockpit you can see the
impact you can really feel it there but
if you're down in the guts of the ship
in an engineering role or something like
that and impacts are happening on the
ship you're maybe not going to feel it
so much so what this system does is it
brings the whole experience of the ship
being hit to wherever you are
resonance also sits nicely alongside our
physical audio system which handles the
audio for the physicalization of props
and objects in the world you can already
hear audible actions in the game such as
objects being thrown rolled handled or
impacted this adds another layer to that
physicality though with resonance it
doesn't need to be beholden to the
physics of an object
Claudius and its underlying engine Sig
audio have been designed with rapid
feature developments at their core
now that a lot of the hard work under
the hood has been done we're able to
quickly develop penetrate on features
such as resonance that allow us to
improve the experience of Star Citizen
and enhance immersion to create a living
breathing world as with all Claudius
features this is available to any object
in any context so its use doesn't even
have to be limited to what we've shown
here for example we could use the blast
radius of an explosion to drive a
player's earringing effect using the
same system or we could affect mixed
changes within the radius of an event
such as a large explosion ducking the
other sounds around it to make even more
room for impact the tools are developed
with creative freedom in mind and
ultimately encourage experimentation so
usually the graphics and the visuals get
all the headlines but to us the audio is
equally if not more important and we
hope that you'll feel the same when all
this work comes online
how'd I do good
thank you
so what do we learn this week well we
learned that Claudius and it's
procedural audio tools allow for the
systemic propagation of sounds and ships
stations and space above and beyond and
that reverberations don't just mean the
events around you sounding and feeling
as they should they can also lead to
Tactical and gameplay implications for
combat wear and tear and much much more
now don't forget the ship Showdown is
heading into the top 16 in just the next
few days and of course the mission
Spotlight is still underway and then of
course we're only nine weeks away nine
weeks away
nine weeks away from citizencon 2953 the
now two-day event at the Los Angeles
Convention Center and tickets are still
available for inside Star Citizen I'm
Jared Huckabee thanks for letting us
share the process of game development
with you and we'll see you all here next
week
