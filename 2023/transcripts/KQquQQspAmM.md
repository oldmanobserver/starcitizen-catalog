## Transcript

hi everybody welcome to another episode
of uh which which show is this Star
Citizen live uh I'm your host Jared
hucke we're back uh we've been off for
for a couple weeks uh last week was the
um UK Manchester office Christmas party
um where where everybody was gathered to
answer uh trivia questions Pub qu style
and drink um a not in significant amount
of alcohol um just want to say that as
far as the the pub quiz contest more
than 50 teams it's a big office uh and
yours truly uh came in third not my best
not not not my best outing but well well
so much Beyond uh what Dave and his team
did uh what place did you get in Dave it
was in it yeah there was a four in it uh
at the front so that just uh I want say
Aaron if you're watching and I know you
are um reading the place of every single
team for like 15 minutes was amazing and
just watching Dave's team sit there
waiting for them to hear their team's
name and it just never came for like 15
minutes it was it was amazing a master
stroke Aaron and I loved it um and then
before that uh we were at bar citizen
Dublin uh which was fantastic great a
chance to meet the the folks out there
and then before that bar C Us in Milan
uh a a tremendous um just uh yes so
we're back we're back for our last show
of the year uh and joining us uh on this
week's show um that's was one heck of an
intro um not a good one just in length
uh we have members from our esteemed AI
teams uh joining us on the show this
week we have uh well let's let you
introduce yourselves Fran tell everybody
who you are and what you do hi I'm
Franchesco Ruchi and I'm the director in
cig
and and what studio are you in I'm in
the Frankfurt office how is it over
there it's pretty good I mean everybody
comes over you know they really love it
they love the studio I think you know
Andrew I'm not sure have you ever been
here or youo you being it's a nice
Studio we have a nice view you know
Frankfurt it's uh it's lovely you guys
cold but do you guys have your holiday
party what is it did you guys have your
holiday party oh yeah same day as the UK
Studio we had like we gathered here in
the studio it was quite nice we you know
we made a Christmas tree together you
know so I put like a very nice
decoration on top of the tree during the
evening yeah and uh yeah it was chill
was really nice uh Andrew the the camera
was switching over to you for some
reason uh so you go next who are you and
what do you do Andrew hi I'm Andrew
Davis I'm lead of the AI feature team
and I'm based in Manchester and I'm very
jealous of your third place team ranking
in the Christmas quiz is because our
team also came third we came bottom
third bottom three I think we were
literally the third from the bottom and
I feel robbed because I know we did
really well on some questions and uh I
think I think it was we were harshly
marked by one of the other teams so I
was very proud of our team name as well
I was um which was proper boss because
we've been working on some boss fights
on the AI so uh and it's also a um SC
saying which I I love because
Liverpool's near you uh all right and
then finally last but not least Diego
tell everybody who you are and what you
do so I'm the AI programmer focusing on
the fly combat and I'm also based in
Manchester and for the quiz we didn't do
too well well I didn't do too well
because he was all about British culture
questions and I didn't know much about
it but I got Ferrera rer so that's good
what hey hey I mean come on I'm I'm
American I'm I'm a proud of the American
educ ation system somehow I made it
through what was your team name uh
vehicle
Renegades that see that's why you guys
struggled uh our team was quiz Roberts's
win commander and that's why we excelled
as well as we did both shout out to the
studio experience team the first place
team uh was the studio experience team
the the the folks who basically make it
possible for us to work uh uh it make
the office a wonderful place to be uh
their team came in first um so
congratulations everybody they have a
little cup that they now have to carry
around and we'll take our chance at
winning it next year all right so that
was a very very long intro uh we're
going to jump into it so this week's
show we have a number of different
formats for this show here on this
week's show it's one of our ask the devs
things so so now that we're done with
the part where I just chat and talk to
them uh we're now putting your questions
directly to our developers so we put up
a thread up on Spectrum where we
collected your questions let you vote on
the ones you want to see answered most
uh and then Fran Diego and Andrew went
through uh collectively and pulled uh
the questions that they felt they could
answer uh best and most accurately at
this point in our development uh so
we're going to jump into those
additionally if you're watching live on
Twitch you can submit questions live by
prefacing the question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets that's going to help me to
pull it out from all the other detritus
uh that goes on in twitch chat
um you you know who you are
V all right so jumping into the question
right now he's a good he's a good person
I don't know why I picked on him it's
just thing I do uh so first question uh
you had to know this was going to come
this is one of those perennial uh AI
questions that come in there uh server
FPS everybody knows that AI performance
is directly and and and inextricably
linked in many ways to server FPS uh
this question is simply What minimum
server FPS is required for the AI to
function as intended
I mean maybe I can I can start there I
think obviously as we said several times
yes it is it is very correlated the uh
the server FPS server performance
without AI uh functions right now uh
just because basically imagine like you
you are playing a game at that FPS is
like the type of refresh rate of the
knowledge of the eye or the decision
making that day do right so if we play
at three frame per second then obviously
for the eyes kind of about SL show right
and in addition to that what I think
sometimes we don't always make clear is
that we don't want to bug down when when
the server is is low in in performance
we obviously don't want to do more
calculation try to get up because that
would make it even more slow right so we
have a lot of our systems are are spread
over a certain amount of frame
calculation for example but finder is a
very expensive you know uh calculation
that usually I does and obviously we
don't want to do one full path
calculation for every single I every
frame that would just you know be too
much so usually binder on games is made
as time lies what we say so you know it
goes through a request and goes through
multiple frames to return you something
so the less the frames the longer it
also takes to do some of the stuff right
so this
why and just also to be clear not all
the issues that you guys see is live
sometimes always ready to FPS
performance some are some are not yeah
sometimes your work just sucks exactly
right sometimes you have just bugs as
well on our side and you we we work hard
to fix those so obviously the one that
are uh right now usually the engine
works pretty bad under five frame per
second we have other issues with
admission uh system and stuff like this
when it goes under five frame per second
uh we don't see very big problems where
is around well I think obviously more
than 10 would be you know the ideal
let's say to have something decent uh
over eight nine frame per second usually
the I can can function decently uh
between five and you know and eight it's
start to struggle a bit because again
all those requests just pile up a bit
more right so the it's not just about
the frame rate but it's also because
this creates this kind of
slow response to other systems right for
example rast of perception or uh
environment analysis uh again path
finding once once again so basically we
are working towards changing a little
bit of some of these patterns so that we
can support better fps in the new in the
New Year especially we're going to focus
on some of those improvements so that we
are going to be less reliant on on uh
extremely good server performance but
obviously I think there's there are two
par initiatives in the engine right or
in the company that is one is trying to
figure out how to make this faster
overall right because it's not just than
high issue if the server goes at five FR
per second this is going to cause
multiple issues on lots of systems right
the guy sees problems with the elevators
or problem with spawning that takes much
longer because obviously even spawning
takes longer if the frame rate is very
low and there is like too much work
happening in the background um so
basically we have these two initiative
right like one that is like making sure
the server goes as fast as possible and
the other one is making sure that our
systems can cope with as best as
possible with low frame rate having
different ideas and it's not necessarily
uh important to share them more right
now but U this is more what i is but on
additional note I think some stuff that
me entry especially I've been working on
in the last weeks was also to fix some
of those bags that are basically giving
you this impression of not responding
but doesn't mean necessar they're really
not responding right so myself I know I
was looking at one B with entry you know
we fix two three
situations like this where maybe the
behavior gets into this kind of strange
Loop what was and I think you know most
of you guys are fighting with FPS have
seen those that is like you're fighting
with some and then some of the I might
just look at you and not shoot at you
but they would aim at you in some
situations right one that I fixed maybe
Andre you can share the one that you
fixed but for example one that I was
looking at was this uh situation where
we we were updating not correctly our
attention Target so they were thinking
they were searching for somebody they
killed somebody they thought that that
their attention T that moment was dead
but then they were targeting you so they
thought that you were dead and they were
starting to investigate and and those
are type of things that we fix all the
time right and we want to make it better
uh
overall so I don't know Andre just yeah
one of ones I was looking at recently
was that um we have certain reaction
animations that play um before they
attack you and uh we had this uh in the
scripting language we were we were it
was receiving a Val and waiting for that
value to go up but because of the
specific requirements of the multiplayer
system when you're online that the there
could be a a lot number of frames before
um it next checks this this value this
alertness level value and it was going
up and not then recognizing it had gone
up so it was forever waiting for this
value not to go up and uh that was
causing sometimes these characters to
just get stuck in a state where they
were and we like oh I'm going to respond
no um nothing's gone nothing's changed
um so that was that was that took a
while to to track down because I think
we we're kind of narrowing down more and
more cases where like smaller and
smaller issues um that we don't see
regularly and that's a really good thing
that we we kind of able to focus more in
on those little bugs that that happen
like oh these sometimes it was one in 10
now it's one in 100 W it's it it's
smaller and smaller but but we're
improving the gam playay each time yeah
and bringing up all the improvements
we've done for squid as well into bu
also allows us to stress test those
Behavior a bit in slightly different
environment right with more targets more
scenarios where you have I know defend
Mission with you know friendly
characters that you need to not you know
to to save while the enemies around and
so on and so on so I think like
obviously uh we also find Sometimes some
of those um different scenarios you know
that that we can stress us more yeah um
no it's it's cool and and when I make a
joke about sometimes their work sucks be
sure to switch back to my camera so they
can see that I'm joking because
otherwise it just sound like a
jerk no no but I think it is kind of
interesting sometimes your work does
suck I know all those
things
um hope you kind of what you like you
know gave like a nice overview of this
no it's
yes honestly it was a better answer than
than than uh I I originally expected
from the question because you went into
different use cases and no it's great
you you covered you covered like three
there were while you were going I was
thinking of like three different
follow-ups and then you just hit the
follow-up and I'm like oh okay I don't
have to do that it's one of the reasons
I love having you on the show Fran um
you very much uh let's talk
about as far as like the big AI topics
that people have that you know obviously
there's there's always the the server
frame rate one because we we've done
enough of these shows that people know
how linked it is the other one is is
also AI blades uh uh B basically you
know we're building a massively
multiplayer online Universe here and not
everybody can always bring their friends
uh where they want to be uh as these
ships get bigger and they have more
turrets and stuff like this the idea of
inserting AI blades into the computer as
like a into the ship as a component so
that turrets can be automated and stuff
has been one of those oldest uh uh
dreams we've had uh about these larger m
multi Cru ships
um what if any progress do we have on
that is has there been any progress on
AI blades um what can you tell us at
this
point um I can say this one
yeah I I think um the technology is
already there because I know a lot of
people um you know they they make the
question is it a concept is it already
working we've got the technology there
we're currently using that in game at
the moment for some Capital ships and
even for um the uh turrets that you see
in the bunkers or outside the stations
um we essentially have these AI module
that communicates with uh various items
in the game like the fly controller and
um they can pass inputs to it same with
the tets in terms of bringing it to the
players I think Franchesco you probably
can answer that better I mean yeah I
think we have even some atcs actually
using the IM module uh in Star season
since quite a while I think because
basically I think the idea is that we
have this like as everything in the
spaceships uh world right where you have
items attached to other items we do have
the special item that Wei module that is
kind of uh a plate what you know what
what the lore is a plate yeah basically
you can't execute exactly logic right
they can run specific Logic for um for
the operation that you needs to perform
and I think right now basically I think
yes we we're gonna we're going to wrap
up these things a bit better and I think
majority of the work obviously is how we
want to expose it to the to the players
how you can buy them you know you can
take them and attach them to the to the
to your ship uh so it's a lot more now
about um how the player interaction the
player Loop is going to be on the blades
but basically on the high side we did we
did have enough progress in the in the
past years basically that to to have
that pretty much ready uh to have all
the basic functionality to to to support
that to support that functionality on
our side um so obviously yeah again our
feature needs to be wrapped around a lot
of themes not just the the eye
functionality you know and uh and that's
where we are at right now but yeah anyi
modu you know again bright blades that
control a turret blades that can control
the bading uh seats blades that can
control you know you can as everything
that we do right this we run uh just you
know our substantial behaviors that
means that we can apply traits we can
apply skill levels to those so we can
buy you know a good blade a bad blade
you know and the SS can confuse what a
good blade means or what a bad blade
means or you know good a good turret
blade that is maybe hitting more often
because you made more money I don't know
or like you know a pilot one that is
different personalities of that blades
right so that he can also do so special
maneuver and that cost more or the one
that that just you know is a bit more uh
conservative and a bit more you know uh
just that you know can can can help you
piling your ship maybe you know you're
not even going to fight that much uh and
then you can just want to have something
that you can control and keep commands
to autopilot somewhere and this is what
we can be yeah the opportunities are the
opportunities for this are are varied I
there are many like L if you've watched
any Star Citizen content Creator live
stream or YouTube video over the last 11
years you've seen you know you know
discussions of of what AI blades could
allow folks to do even just the simplest
idea of being able to jump into a
hammerhead by yourself and just you know
have four blades run in the the turrets
and just be like hey if anything's
hostile destroy it that's all I want
just wait until it's hostile but the
second I Mark something hostile just
please like Target that crap and blow it
up just the just the simplest kind of
modules can can add a lot of longevity
and and variety to the to the game and
then of course like you talk about you
know the different variations you know
some are good some are some are bad some
have different traits some are more
aggressive some are more defensive uh
stuff like this there's even like like
storytelling possibilities with like the
mission system like like we we you
developed like imagine the best AI blade
ever was was actually manufactured 50
years ago in the history and they don't
make them anymore but there's still
several of them buried out Across the
Universe and they can be you know you
know found and and revamped and then you
know so so it's not even necessarily you
have to spend more money to have the
better stuff you can go find and
discover the better stuff like the the
opportunities are are endless and we've
been talking about this for a long time
it's it's one of the things that I'm
most excited about is as starts is and
continues into 2024 and Beyond and this
is not me saying that AI blades are
coming next year you've gotten all the
what's coming next year from me
yesterday uh there's more but that's all
I'm willing to talk about yesterday uh
but when this stuff comes online it'll
be another fundamental change to to uh
space combat in the Precision universe
so I think we're all very excited for
when that can
come um let's just hit some of our big
gosh let's hit some of our altimer here
we we've got server FPS we've got AI
blades uh creatures let's hit creatures
um everybody is awaiting the day to go
into a a ice cave on on on E or whatever
and find a big giant Boreal stalker
there to rip their their their their
arms off or even just you know the space
cows uh that we that we showed at uh at
citizen G or in the star engine video uh
what
progress if any can you tell us about uh
the uh the state of AI creatures is this
something near far where are we what can
you tell us I I'm you said you were
excited for blad so I'm I'm my and my
team are very excited uh for um working
on creatures uh we've already started um
quite a lot we've we've got some work
that we've already developed for
squadron 42 that we're uh bringing
forward and we're expanding on uh
different range of creatures with lots
of different attributes that I can't
really talk about too much yet but
um we're definitely starting with the
Quasi quasi gra um so that's that's been
a fun one seeing that move at the moment
we've got it it's jiggling up and down
so we've got to solve that issue but
that's yeah it's definitely something
that we're working on right now and
we're excited to be working on which one
see what we what we saw in the in the
demo there is is an actual quasi Grace
or moving around the the planet is you
know is it's really like the work that
we've started one that you guys have
seen uh live like well like in the video
from czen con that it's you know an
actual creat that we're working on yeah
I I I I think it's safe to say without
me getting in trouble We There are
multiple creatures currently in
development we we showed the star whell
and we we've shown the the Quasi grass
is that what I just call space cow is it
quasi graer quasi graer something this
something like that I feel like it had a
different name at some point um yeah I'm
I'm with Nam so but you know we've
shown those but there's actually a host
of different creatures uh both
aggressive and not uh that are currently
in development and um um when I talked
yesterday about things that we we're
waiting for you we'll let you guys
discover on your own that's that's
probably one of those I think unless
something changes we probably won't do a
big feature on it I think that's one of
those things like I I I would rather
leave that for people to discover when
that when it goes in so uh we we can
cover it we we can look back at it later
and whatever but some things people
often ask why we cover certain things in
ic and why we don't like we didn't like
we didn't cover the f8 thing we wanted
to let you guys discover that when it
happened we didn't we didn't cover
playground before because again we
wanted to let you guys discover that as
was happening I feel like creatures
probably be one of this I think I think
I like the idea of you of people just Lo
logging in one day and what the hell
there's a space cow there or something
like that so I I we'll see it's no
promise but uh I think I'd rather wait
on that than cover it in ic
immediately
um all right next question on your list
here uh replication layer there's a lot
of talk a lot of excitement a lot of
hype about the replication layer work
that's going on uh folks who follow the
the PTU the evocati the previe channel
know that they're doing a whole bunch of
testing for that now uh 322 uh which
went out yesterday went out yesterday
right yeah which went out yesterday um
has a lot of the underlying uh stuff for
replication layer inside it which is why
in certain when you when you turn on
certain debug stuff you'll see
replication layer off and what not like
this so it the work's going in even now
um
does that work affect Ai and if it does
how does it make it easier does it make
it diff more difficult uh is this a good
thing for you a terrible thing for you
talk to us about how replication layer
affects your work if
any oh maybe I can I can start and then
you guys just interrupt me any time so I
think basically yes it does impact us um
as everything that we do basically every
character High character especially
humans right are very much Sim
we we do share a lot of stuff with the
player so we have we have a lot of
things in common the difference of AI is
that obviously you want to have ai or in
general you have right now especially
you have ai out authoritative on a
server right so what it means is the
server mesh we come into different
stages first of all you know we still
have like you know the the split between
the obligation layer and uh
dgs and then you have clients right so
what it means is that usually
uh the first step that you will get is
basically that everything change every
change that you know the entities that I
I control that will apply are similar to
other players so they will write their
own data their obligation layer clients
will read it from their obligation layer
directly so that is the biggest change
that we will get and in general all the
applications that you get all the
improvements you get from from the actor
code and the actor team we get it also
in a way for free because you know uh
anything that the eye can do is or the
player can do but pretty much the they
want the eye to do it so everything that
they make as a change from the player
perspective also automatically applies
to the eye um what I think it will be
more interesting uh in the new year and
the new in the new changes with the
replication layer is when we will have
multiple servers and when you know the
way this can be expanded in a way but
let's start just with the basics of the
multiple servers right similar to what
we saw in in uh citizen con with the
demo from poll you will have characters
that move across different servers right
and the this is the big difference
between I caus and NPC and player caus
right that player characters
authoritative on your client you guys
play your brain is the context that
always keeps consistency between what
you want to do and what you see the
player doing it right but on the eyes
side when we move one character from one
server to another and his authority
change the big difference is that you
don't only want to replicate the effects
of what the guys are are doing but you
also want to replicate their context of
their decision making because if I'm
fighting with you yes I could restart
the behavior but that means like you
know as a first step you would just you
might just select another character you
might see a bit of discrepancy from what
they're trying to do when they when they
switch server and the main issue is that
you as a player you will not understand
or you should not understand when you
switch server you should be irrelevant
right so we want to have that type of
experience as seemless as possible like
everything is their citizen um so this
would be the biggest impact that we have
right so we'll have a lot of servers AI
that might cross server at any given
moment whatever they're doing and that
needs to basically keep the consistency
between what they decide to do and what
they're actually doing on the multiple
servers right so the server to server
obviously you know it's U it's it's a
big change that we want to do I don't
know Diego or Andrew if you want to add
anything
there one thing I would say is we we've
been working on this recently um one of
the challenges we've got is as things
are now not all on the same server that
they've got to be
replicated and not only if well that's
server meshing but also when you're
coming back from the replication layer
say if say if you're if that server's
gone down or um that it's gone out of
scope and you're coming back from it
you've got to restore them to the
correct state so that any AI that go up
and see um a character on that server
and then interact with that that they're
still getting the correct information to
make decisions about what Behavior they
want to do um and so we've just been
working on that that very particular
thing for um a thing called the
observable state which allows us to say
whether a character is dead or
unconscious and um we we found that um
because we've now split it up and it's
coming back from the replication now
it's not always uh getting this
information updated so you have a you
have a an object that's basically in an
unknown State and then um we get bugs
because because it's not being um
because that information is wrong so
that's something we've been working on
fixing to make sure that that process is
all done correctly and and and the the
information is there whether it's for
server meshing or for the the
replication layer yeah I'm imagining
hearing you guys talk about this the
idea you kill somebody and their state
becomes dead you pick up their body and
you carry them over and as you cross to
another section replication later brings
them over but now they're back alive
it's like might perceive them alive you
know because the other thing is like
that you need to make the stay
consistent right so for example that
could be even that you die you re you
get revived but then your state you know
the I might think that you're actually
still dead you know or something like
this and then what will happen is like
again there are some situations where
you might perceive it as they not
responding maybe it's just like a back
by the fact that maybe the state it's
it's correcting one side of the game you
know the components but maybe they get
propagated correctly from the
initialization order or for example in
this case who owns that knowledge at
that State right so we are trying to
split it so that you know we get better
at the events and we can read the states
better and we can propagate the events
of the states much better so that things
are always consistent so um there's a
question in the chat as a follow up to
the last question uh S3 Rog
four uh will we be able to hunt
creatures and sell them alive or or
parts of them you know this isn't for
you guys s S3 Rog four you and me be be
nice to the animals just just when you
get them when you you see them just just
be nice and see if you can pet them and
if you can't pet them go to Spectrum and
write an angry thread and say disco told
me to do this because I should be able
to pet them uh uh and I think they
should be able to pet them but be nice
just be nice and maybe sometime later
you know when we're all bored
maybe but be
nice
sorry
uh especially at the whales save the
space whales swear there's some people
like all they want to do is is go
whaling like I tune into a YouTube video
oh my gosh I want hunt the space whales
and and and and sell their blood I'm
like just be be nice to the whales just
be
nice at least in the game we can always
respond now now eventually you know when
space well versus Space well yes they
should be able to fight like Let Let
them fight Godzilla
style but um we're just we're way off
the track now
um what other question you have here you
have a question here about will AI have
advantages over players like using night
vision we're not going to do that one
that that's a trick question they want
they every time we do a show with
somebody they try to bring up night
vision we know I made it I I I yelled at
the guy at the chair the last time we
were here with night vision I got crap
for that afterwards but they know they
know they know they
know just leave it at that I said I
would stop harping on night
vision they know I promise I got
you uh next question AI are clearly
becoming smarter and responding to more
situations but will they start
communicating with each other about
their actions warning each other of
threats even if their friendly AI even
if the friendly AI is outside of their
vocal audio distance like would they use
radios stuff what you
got um I I could I could start again we
we we've I don't know why I sit up on my
seat like that every time but um yeah
we've been making quite a lot of strides
recently uh joining up with lots of
teams the audio and dialogue teams to
kind of um get more consistent usage of
the wild lines across um both Squadron
42 to and inar citizen um and very
specifically on the the point to do with
radios we we have quite quite a few of
those scenarios within um some of the
levels in Squadron 42 but they're mainly
um scripted where where if you if
there's kind of stealth levels where if
you um if you get detected by them or if
a body get if you kill someone silently
do a self takedown and then they
discover the body and you haven't you
haven't hidden it somewhere then they'll
radio on to their leader and that
changes the flow of the level from much
more from stealth to a much more combat
based level um we we so they've been
very scripted so far we have had quite a
few discussions about making that much
more um systemic and generic but we
haven't U really we haven't got too far
on that but um the definitely definitely
some uh great benefits to doing that
because one thing for example is that um
if you know who your squadmates are you
you you can um you know who to call out
for when for example somebody's gone
down um you you will notice if they're
missing if if you're they're walking
around a level and that that the
response doesn't come back that kind of
stuff and get that more systemic
behavior from some of the stealth
sections as well and I'd like to see
that more in St as well so yeah it also
becomes important with the uh
organization system as as the
organization reputation system gets
further developed in Star Citizen uh we
talked about that a lot with with pyro
like a lot of the you know they are
going to be
NPC you know people at Rough and Ready
and stuff like this and and you know as
you kill them or attack them and stuff
your reputation with them starts to go
down and they become more aggressive and
stuff so there there there should of
course be opportunities where you can
you know assault one in private and you
know nobody finds out but there should
also be situations where you know they
get off a radio message before you kill
them and you know you take the necessary
rep hit and stuff like that so there's
all kinds of implementations for that
radio uh transmission ability as far as
the Pu goes that wouldn't necessarily be
necessary in Squadron but that's I think
in general like the communication we do
have the communication just uh like in
terms of feature right because I think
right now if they find a dead body right
they would go investigate they will call
out like you know even if it's not by
radio they will still call out the other
ones and that calling out is the one
that you know basically allow them the
other guys to be uh attracted by the
fact that something happened yeah or for
example we do have you know hearing
Friendly Fire and stuff like this and
these things also propagate correctly
through the audio propagation that I
think we maybe spoke about at certain
point you know but we do have like the
basically the audio perception on the
eyes side now does respect the the audio
propagation I don't I don't know Jared
if you remember if it's already in
season right now or not but is
definitely like one of the things that
would carry on will bring in the in the
next releases and it's like we can
really say like you know this the rooms
you close the door the audio doesn't
propagate there you know so the guys you
can kill somebody in a you know one
enemy in a room that is closed and maybe
even if he screams or something like
this if the environment is you know
doesn't allow audio to to propagate then
the other ones won't be alerted and if
you know the door is open they might
hear it and so on and so on so I think
this is actually um really interesting
you know in terms of the type of uh
mechanics and you opportunities that
that he opens up for the players yeah uh
Captain Ro R reld reld reld I don't know
uh says won't uh rest and relax and
others have CCTV recordings that they
can watch later I
mean in the fiction of the of the verse
yes but it's a question of resources and
development do you want you want do we
want to spend our time creating a
internal CCTV system than a place where
NPCs are standing looking at it and
watching it and reviewing it or would we
rather you know get all the other things
we need NPC's doing you know working
better uh but you know radio
communication like what we're talking
about you know can simulate those kinds
of things and stuff so I I I think we've
addressed the need there's a need to be
able
to communicate beyond what can
immediately be seen or heard uh in
certain situations but you know when the
time comes but but the yeah there are
like these things that you're describing
J is correct right that you want to
simulate some of those things you know
not necessary like in the type of
details but they give you the impression
that you have exactly you don't actually
build a
CCTV system and have NPCs there watching
monitors and you know perception
qualities you know what are they seeing
stuff like that but but there are ways
to to give you that that type of feeling
that you know the game play will will
resembl that
yeah uh what's next will there be a
system for NPCs dropping their guns and
surrendering if they are in a situation
where they clearly cannot win uh surely
they would value their lives
right that's the question what you got
who wants to go
first go go ahead Andrew yeah this is
something that we've we've already
worked on um for squadron um definitely
surrendering um we we definitely need a
little bit more polish on on all of the
the states that has got got for them so
civilians people without weapons should
immediately run away and cower and hide
um and then if if if if they're a a
combat a combatant then they should and
they run out of ammo then they will um
look first look for other ammo if
there's if there's any available and
after that they should run away and hide
until there's basically no com
combatants left in the the current
current fight situation and when that
happens then they they can go into this
um this uh surrender Behavior where
you'll either be able to do another
stealth take down or restrain them um
one of the things that we have we
haven't actually got that uh that flow
some of that flow in uh sism because
with the AI at the moment you have
infinite ammo um and that the reason for
that is because um we we've got the
option to not have infinite ammo but it
does require rebalancing quite a lot of
the missions to put in ammo crates so
that they've got the right amount of of
ammo to be able to to do that but it's
definitely something the load outs as
well for the existing so that's that's
the the process that we will go through
right I think there's also like the fact
that obviously when they draw they will
drop the weapons if they surrender as
the you know not sure what ask the
question but you know what what was
mentioned and basically I think what
they will also do is like if you let
them stay there surrender then you give
you know you go far away enough then the
might also try to find back some guns
and you know start fighting yeah start
fighting again yeah don't leave themed
exactly so if you leave you know if they
are enemies and you leave them you know
just in the surrender State and you
don't do you don't restrain them as you
said and then the other NPCs can also
unrestrained them if they find them
restrained can try to revive them so
this is all the flow that we do have but
you don't yet all see that in Star citiz
and per
se interesting to see when it's going to
be there and you guys will will enjoy
and will give us
feedback all right nope no sorry I was
just trying to cough coughing fit in the
middle of your your thing I was just
trying not to distract you so I was
trying to C not cough ah it's all right
if I have to go make it listening to
Fran all right I'm good almost
yeah I'm good okay I can talk at it is
is this a
demonstration of our the AI Reviving
Behavior
gonna come in somebody go to
J no just m pen M pan I wasn't even I'm
I'm just sitting here and all of a
sudden it's like the the whole
respiratory system's like nope all
right at least it brought more color to
my
face nav mesh let's talk about nav mesh
when nav mesh was first introduced uh uh
I'm just reading the question here it
felt like lwh hanging fruit would be to
add patrolling AI at the surface
entrance to existing bunker sites uh but
this never happened does planetary nav
mesh not apply to existing asset or
Mission
locations um I think this a combination
of stuff right so I think yes it does
apply to all the locations so the way it
works right now and we're finishing to
to extend the last bit that we are
missing
but basically whenever you go on a
planet it will just gener in a mesh uh
on on specific restraint there are some
constraints right now and this is what
we are trying to remove that it will
generate across the whole the full
surface of the planet but the issues
this is the combination with the
behaviors so what you need to build this
Outpost with the for example the guards
uh guard behaviors security behaviors
you need to have the information about
what does it mean patrolling for example
so what this usually works is this is
this pipeline that we are finishing to
enforce and you know the the structure
that we want to build for for the new
Outpost and from there we apply to the
old ones as well is that we want to have
all this information ped on this also
connects with the population manager
that we want to build you know how we
populate the environment automatically
based on what can be done and so on and
so on but the idea is like when you want
to have a guard right the guards can
have uh for example right now the
Securities can have multiple things that
they can do could guard allc
they could Patrol they could you know uh
react in specific ways and so on and so
on to do so it requires to be spone and
request for designer to explain what
what we want from the guards otherwise
they will try to see if they find a uh
patrolling part that is similar to what
you guys see is in the ugf when the
enemies they kind of run a sort of
similar uh guard behaviors uh they try
to find a patrolling part in the ugf and
they go around or if they don't find it
they try to move around here and there
this is what you usually see and I think
the moving random is the one that I
personally hate the most because
obviously it doesn't really sell what
they're trying to do right it's the one
that my my my classic sentence is if
they trying to do some random stuff
that's what they will sell they will say
that they're doing random stuff is not
going to be really interesting um and
this I think why why you guys feel that
some of the situations don't have this
guard patrolling it's just because
basically the the Barb is not yet outo
to sell the right experience right some
of the old ones but the N is there you
can fight with those guys and you know
they they they will fight with you and
so on and so on um obviously we are
aware of some of the um problems that
are there that you guys have are
experiencing some situations for example
we have been looking at on polishing
some of the experience right now when
you go on some specific Outpost where
there are neutral faction where you can
kill them there are like you know some
Edge uh cases on on what's and what's
not right now for example what does he
mean when you when you can kill from a
mission perspective somebody that is
neutral or they are a guy supposed to
still react to you go on with their
lives because they know there are some
criminals around them and well Bounty
Huns are going to come and just kill
them because that's the Bounty they want
right so if unless you bother the other
ones they you know the guys don't get
bothered these all stuff that we are
iterating and with SAR CM being a in
development game you know and constantly
updated games sometime you get partial
version of that one right and there are
still a little bit of uh of things that
they're not very nice from our
perspective either right but I think
it's nice that you guys can start to
experience what we want to have uh
eventually okay but yeah I think
basically like you can have we can have
it from Tech perspective that's what you
will all have um we've been improving a
lot of the navigation links as well uh
right now for example we been uh getting
the full support for uh ladders the new
ladder systems that the actor team has
also been working on so that we can
fully have yeah eyes using ladders using
IR loocks uh you know and all these
additional things that allow the eye for
example to leave an outpost and go on
the planet as well right this is exactly
the reason why we wanted to have the
planet navigation mes going in the same
structure of the regular exported Nesh
because then all these other systems
work out of the box you can do all this
stuff right you can land a ship and have
people Le
ship I
um you included this why does Miss
Babbage have NPC reactions to weapons
and
violence you put this in yeah yeah I put
that on is the is the Hologram right
yeah yeah basically this the funny bar
because those things are actually Runing
behaviors right so sometimes if you
select basically I think it's going to
be interesting like to explain a bit how
these things works right we have what we
call call a master graft and the master
graft is basically the flow of behaviors
or activities so for example when we are
when we have an MPC that that moves
around and sit on a ship then he knows
how to run Diego's Behavior right when
when he fights when he sees an enemy he
knows that he say oh I'm on a ship I'm
I'm sitting you know on a on a pading
ship so if I see an enemy that's how I
fight if I'm on the ground that's how I
fight and in every of those states he
knows to which you know what are the
things that are interesting you know for
him to react to so there are special
masterr for specific situation like this
one where you don't want them to react
because they're not real characters but
if you just me set up those and you set
them up as regular characters then they
will also react to those sort of things
right and in addition to that I think
what we had I think you some of you guys
had like some really nice Reddit post on
this one as well that were like the
reacting for example to a m pen and
getting scared or reacting to the multi
tool and getting scared right is because
obviously some of these things maybe you
know we have a fix on the soron branch
and didn't get it into Star season in
time because you know we didn't we
didn't no this uh the right time when
you know before it gets released when
it's in PTU and so on and so on and I
think obviously there is these things
that we want to expect such that
designers can Define exactly what is
threatening right because in theory
maybe the multitool can be threatening
you could damage you right if you use it
with specific modes should they know it
should they not react when you have you
know I don't know uh just a m pen in
their hands yeah probably should not
freak out if you just aim at them with a
M pen uh but maybe they should have you
know um if you have the multi-tool
enable with the with the cutting uh the
cutting tool then that one should be
dangerous for other characters and
should be worried but like should it be
worried if you're just carrying a gun
lowered well that might depends on
jurisdiction right so there are some
levels of polishing that we still we're
still working on it because I would
imagine like if you're ire with the gun
lower well it's kind of accepted there
but if you go around your babage with
the gun lowered is still not accepted it
should still be scary for people to see
you uh you know having a a gun uh in
your hands yeah at the same time though
now I'm now I'm Des I desperately want
to go and Pitch to the mission team some
bad actor that hacks miss the miss
Babbage program and turns her into a
Terminator
EXA that's and has her attacking people
and going wild like a rogue like a rogue
AI you know attacking people the siege
of new babage where it's just everybody
versus a malevolent uh uh
Anna I know she'd be holographic weapon
and that's why she's scared because
she's running away from something that
only can damage Holograms yeah I know
Anna would be down we'll
see we'll see how badly the mission team
laughs at me they don't laugh at nice
it's nice to add those question you
heard from my perspective because it's
kind of Interest like if I when when I
was just playing games before joining
the industry these are type of things
that I would really be interesting in uh
interested in knowing why that why they
happen right and now behind the scene
things work I don't know yeah well AI is
I think we've I think we've talked about
this before there there's you know
obviously there are a lot of buzzwords
around Star Citizen stuff Fidelity and
and and and and whatever but uh uh uh
immersion is is one of those forever
ones you know it it immersion forms
everything we try to do regardless of
what it is but whereas immersion is this
sensation that's built by everything
around you it's built by the quality of
the art it's built by the the the
Fidelity of the VFX and stuff like this
AI is one of those is is is I don't know
it's got this special place in this
because every we can accept we've all
played video games going back to the N64
to the Super Nintendo to the Atari 2600
like VAR various levels of graphics and
stuff we we can suspend our disbelief
easy with bad Graphics or stuff like
this but when
characters behave the way we don't
expect them to that's one that's one of
the biggest things that pull us out of
it it's it's just it's always
interesting to me that of everything
that contributes to an immersion and
everything does Pro there's probably
nothing that does so so more that's
that's more critical to a true sense of
immersion than the
AI how do you how do you we're we're
nearing the time we've got some time for
some more questions but how do you guys
deal with that responsibility am I right
am I talking out of my ass right now if
I'm like no it's not important am I
right and if it is how do you deal with
that that pressure in your work I think
I think this this I think you definitely
are right and I think there's a lot of
of things there one is that we are
bringing together lots of different game
systems so we have we're we're working
with with all of those things we're
working with the graphics we're working
with animation we're working with the
effects are working with the sound
design and all of those things so that
so it's it's a Nexus point for a lot of
other people's Tech to to all make it
work um but also you're right that that
you can notice uh things in gameplay a
lot um where when you don't forgive
somebody not doing the right thing a lot
more than um in on a lot of systems and
I think a big part of that is kind of
telegraphing what the the AI is doing in
the right way um making understandable
choices and and that's one of the things
we've seen with the um the issues with
AI is not reacting um in uh the bugs
that we've been fixing recently is that
not necessarily they they were doing
they were doing they thought they were
doing the right Behavior because it
wasn't understandable and readable to
the player that that it looks wrong
wrong and it immediate looks wrong no
matter how clever that behavior might be
um and so that's that's definitely
something that we we've been working on
a lot and one of the areas where we
we're kind of focusing on is um you you
you code your your AI for a kind of very
um known situation and then designers
and and level artists and all of these
people come up with wonderful ways to
test testing things and situ situations
you hadn't um imagined when You' first
started writing the code and so one of
the things we've been working on a lot
is adding in lots of fallback cases so
oh what if I don't have a nav mesh in
this particular situation what should I
do instead what if I um what if I have
no target but there's this person who's
shooting at me in front of me um and
they can react to kind of maybe not
necessarily bugs but other little other
little mishaps in a much more sensible
readable way that's understandable to
the player and that that gives that much
more um uh that you're not going to
notice much and you get you're going to
sometimes think that they're they they
sometimes we go the opposite way and
they then they seem to be too efficient
and they can they can be uh attacking
the player too often and oh no they know
too much youve got to dial it back back
again again so it's uh yeah it's a it's
a delicate balancing Balancing
Act what he's saying Andrew there about
being them too efficient that's
something that we were when we were
making the fly AI I was playing with
yogi the player experience theme and you
know we were learning how we were
playing against each other and I came up
with a prototype right and the first
prototype that I made I think my AI just
destroyed them all uh it was too good um
and it's those things that is sometimes
a hidden Miss and we keep playing to
making sure that it actually feels
uh good uh not not as good as being a
killing machine but you know good enough
that it's a good
challenge Yogi is not that good though
but they killed him or they killed you I
mean we can't we can say he not here
right we can say we can say it clearly
right
yeah he he knows I mean there's no
there's no secrets between us and Yogi
Yogi is
bad but don't say that to him okay no no
I mean we we keep it for for us only
yeah three and J Bic that's that's just
where he stays just putting teams on do
not disturb right
now did you get already a mess no I'm
not here I'm not
here but I think like in addition to
that I think like basically one
important thing is I think we do we do
feel the pressure of trying to give this
experience to the players right and I
think we do want I think what's what's
hard in development and I think this is
where the the you know the the realties
sometimes comes into place that you need
to choose between sometime focusing on
the long-term goal or the shortterm goal
right so you know that some bikes might
be also things that you might fix later
because you you know you have it planned
and obviously from the way we develop
the game and the way we share in the
game is that you often can see much more
than what players would usually see in
in a normal development flow right that
is like you you do it close doors for so
long that you only see uh when things
are are working well um so from us I
think there's also know sometimes the
frustration of saying like I wish you
know I could have just cleaned up this a
bit better or been focusing more on uh
this other bag or this other experience
that the entry was saying or you know
the balancing that die is also talking
about right and and I think obviously we
do have the the the great advantage on
the other side that is how you guys can
experience stuff that is not finished
and we can get much earlier some of the
feedback and yes some stuff might
already be in uh planned but some other
stuff might actually be really good to
get that feedback right and the type of
of um yeah of of changes that can you
know we can push based on stuff that we
might have not considered you know so I
think the advantage the disadvantage as
well but it's definitely good to have
this this opportunity from our
perspective as well okay uh we got five
minutes there there are three more
questions I want to squeeze in if if you
don't mind going a few minutes long uh
I'm asking you live on screen so you
can't say no without sound like a jerk
um the first question uh comes from Rand
print in the chat will we ever see NPCs
writing trams ever
again yes um we do have that
functionality in we need to bring it to
Star season as well we need to make sure
that all you know the the setup is
correct for the TRS that we have but
basically the NPCs can understand uh
transits they can understand to wait for
the transit to arrive drive and they can
use it to travel from to location that
are that are existing or another
approach that we want to use for the
transit is also as a sort of somean
closets when publish needs to come in
and out of the environment we can use
them to stream in and out NPCs out of
the environment and the all the basic
Tech is there basically yes yeah uh
second question this goes a bit to the
balancing so obviously we talked about
you know making NPCs too capable not
that that's all there like in the moment
and stuff there's a couple questions
this list I'm just going to combine them
into one that has to do with NPC's being
able to use technology things like radar
scanning and stuff like that what
how how do you uh what What's the pro
what's the process What's the progress
for that can or do AI use scanners to
see through walls or radar to detect
ships from far away do they have access
to the same technologies that the
players do does and and if so how the
hell do you balance that
that so in terms of uh radar I can speak
for the ships but yes the AI just uses
the radar component as you know the one
that the playist uses in the ship uh so
um yeah just got those you know
depending on the ship that you the AI is
flying you have those radar capabilities
based on the balance of that ship I want
to use the same on FPS as well because I
think you know they will be Cactus
obviously the balance is through the
trades that we we've spoken about and
the the you know uh the fact that they
do have like their load outs or you know
the these these items first of all so
for example if we keep an FPS Cactus
with the with the radar you can also
decide from the sign perspective if they
want them to use it or not first of all
obviously the ship is a bit special
because ship versus ship you have to use
the rer but basically the the perception
system from the eye can be extended on
the different senses as we call it the
radar is one cense and the behavior has
already specific notes that allow them
for example to Ping through the Rader
and the other thing that we want to do
is to react to be
pinked uh and also in that case
basically depends first you will react
if you're pinked if you do have a radar
that notifies you of being pinked and we
can also say like maybe there are some
easier missions or you know with the
balance of the of the game play Flow
that we want that we can say that okay
but those guys should not react to be
pinked but it should be able to Pink So
that you can also have an experience
where we can also use the ey to train
because this is the other part of of
game mechanics that is important right
you want to use the ey to also teach
mechanics to the play so you can say
okay now we make you a mission where the
I can ping you but you know you're safe
to Ping yourself so they can still kind
of learn that that mechanics and they as
the player we use the exact same item so
the I can say want to being very quick
you know I want to being very long so
they can be detected and we can
absolutely control this one and what
this does it just updates your
perception so that I can basically uh
know the snapshot of your position from
that we don't really cheat on the ey
perception right so we have the Vision
Audio uh you know radar sense and and
and pinging uh updates
basically I think there are several
levels of that as well with the AI that
one of the levels is oh well they'll
just know that they've been pinged and
um so they'll suddenly they'll change
alertness state and maybe go hunt for
you and another one and the the higher
up level is that they will be able to
kind of pinpoint where you are and
immediately go to you like oh I've been
detected uh last question and then I'm
going to do one more thing after that
because it's my show and it's the last
one of the year uh last question and you
you put this in here so it's your fault
um friend you were at citizen gone uh as
they were wait as we were waiting to
start the first day um a not
insignificant amount of people uh in the
audience decided to stand up on their
chairs and
toos uh you've been doing this for a
while now with start citizen how does
that make you feel when you when when
you see that is this something you can
laugh at is this something that drives
you crazy I know I know I think it's the
joke that we need to take right uh on
our way but also I know that the
community is always you know very
supportive with that and stuff like this
and I think as we explained I think the
the same the chair is kind of fun one
because well similar to the SL reaction
in some situation is that there are bugs
that people perceive as one bug but
often those are caused by a lot of
different issues that you know you might
fix one and then it works and then
there's another issue that comes in
right it can be setup issues it could be
um you know a change on the server mesh
that we just made and now the the value
of the of the chair that you should be
sitting in it doesn't get restored
correctly and this is where you know you
see it majority the time that we see
right now right is is due to the
streaming in and out that when they
restore they don't connect correctly for
different reasons to the last known
usables that were attached to and this
could be maybe because get stream out in
the in the way of attaching to the
usable so it's just a touch you know it
didn't get store that value in and we
need to reproduce that one and make sure
that that one doesn't happen again and
so on and so on I even had a s moment
some code that was actually meant to rep
patch all the situations so you would
not see it but my take is at this point
in time for the project it's more
important that we figure out and we
found all those bugs and all those edge
cases compared to hi them just to you
know show necessary always the good
experience and obviously yes we want to
have you the good experience but want to
be the real experience right because if
we hide right now a bug it might buy us
back later on in a really hard way
because we didn't you know fix it
properly at this time so I think we
chapos is chapos becomes this big flag
hey there's something here that that you
need to address you could turn it off
actually it's also fun that I think
people also connect a lot this standing
on the share with the toos but they're
not necessarily connected sometimes I
think the toos I see it you know we
still have some situations where you see
it moving from Far T posing you know
because there are some issues and we
have you know for example right now we
were looking with know some of the guys
in the tech team Andrea as well he was
looking at some situation where the
lightweight update was called in the
wrong moment you know we we're
investigating that and I think this is
where we see dep it means something is
not updating on the character animation
side right for different reason it might
be you know they get stuck in some State
on the you know the manin side that
doesn't update or there's some animation
wrong set up or the the actor things you
know the actor code things there not
updating or the high is playing wrong
animation so you might see thees in this
situation but not necessar connected
with the standing you know so you see
sometime standing and they just look
their M Glass because they're just iing
and so yeah and you wouldn't want to
change it like Chad is sitting here
saying well you could just change the
default thing to be sitting and but that
would hide the problem and wouldn't find
the that's what I'm saying it's the
standing on chairs of the toot is the
big flag that tells you there's
something needs to be fixed so if you
hide it by changing the default to be
something that is less conspicuous then
these bugs just persist and they just
and I think there is one thing that is
also important really because is that
internally in our builds this is not
that simple to reproduce like it's
really hard for our QA guys to actually
make guys standing on the chair
internally this is why it's so important
for us to also have it live as a um as a
final effect because if we don't find it
find it there uh it's it's it's really
hard to reproduce it internally as well
I think some some of this combination is
low FP yes with the streaming in you
know is is is really like stressing out
the servers and the code so that you
know we can figure out when things are
still broken in some some situations
okay uh well that's it for the questions
guys congratulations thank you for doing
this uh Before I Let You Go I want to
pitch you on one thing I I want to pitch
you something so we talk about all these
AI attributes I wasn't playing this this
just came up during the show you know
you know the good bad lazy whatever like
this I mean obviously you know
occasionally you want to sprinkle like a
like a Red Baron just a super Ace who
pops up every once in a while and can
just obliterate
everybody I want to pitch you the
opposite end of the red barar and I want
to pitch you the the the guy or gal who
completely lied on their resume who has
no business being there who's never
picked up a P4 before just the random
mercenary who's like I shouldn't be here
I I I I I I answered a job at I I don't
I don't want to fight anybody I don't
want to hurt anybody just basically the
the the the the my producer Dave of
people who would just stand there like I
don't know what's going
on as an
attribute I think it's a really good
idea you go go and hide in the uh in the
engine room or something so i' i' send
this suggestion to Zach right now yeah
do you want to call that TR yeah uh you
just call it David David you just call
it David if you need his last name I'll
let you know but it's just just just the
absolute just I I don't want to do any
of
this it's just I don't know what's going
on why is this happening to me I'm not
even supposed to be here today just it
should it should be rare you know just
like the Red Baron's going to be rare it
should be like the rarest thing because
it's going to look like a mistake but
you know it's like no the mistake was
you being there you being involved I'm
just it's a it's a destroy David week
