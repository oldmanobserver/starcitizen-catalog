go live
bringing up like privileged internal
teams chats like oh I gotta show you
something when we're like nine seconds
away from going live hi everybody
welcome to
Star Citizen live uh Mission maker part
two uh I'm your host well not really not
this week this is your host hi I'm
Elliott mobile
what do you do Elliot Moby uh I'm a lead
designer who makes missions
and uh
this is part two we've never done a part
two SEO uh last last week we did one of
our Game Dev episodes where we sit with
a developer and we watched them work uh
for an hour and normally uh people just
you know you know like they do what they
can within the course of an hour and
then you know we get to the end of the
hour it's like okay that's it
um you know this is this is what you can
make in an hour you know you know and
it's it's it's good to Showcase a
process but it's not like a good result
usually because again it's only an hour
um Elliott fell way behind uh uh our our
estimations and what every other
developer that's ever done this and
barely got halfway through
um the first half of his work
um because he took over the show hosting
uh which was fine because I didn't want
to do it that week and I'm not
complaining
wow how are we doing Dave
pretty good so good really good so this
week uh we're going to continue we're
gonna we're gonna we're gonna pick up
where we left off uh I wanna stress that
Elliot has done no work on this between
this Friday and last Friday he's done no
work at all in the last week really uh
we're gonna talk about that in a
different meeting but he's definitely
not touched any aspect of this since
yesterday everything is exactly where we
left off so if the Mission Works uh he
was doing a good job last week and the
mission doesn't work
there won't be a part three I promise
because I'm going to Gamescom next week
so Elliot
say yes hello yes uh
we got music underneath to drown out the
pregnant pauses right
that's Pete yeah
uh we're gonna turn it over to Elliot
and uh he's gonna pick up where we left
off Elliot
hello where we live off so uh the last
thing we did we're on the wrong camera
on the wrong camera David thank you
hello uh so
uh last week
um
we finished off uh we made the module
that tells the ship to spawn and
populates it full of people and then
he's making him actual main module where
you are going to be sent to get void
dude knock them out and then deliver
them
um we set up a bunch of them at that
main logic but just hadn't finished it
in time uh so we're gonna continue on
from there
um
and then hopefully we'll be able to get
this done make the mission record which
is one of the next steps which is how
you guys would see the mission and then
from there I would
um
play the game test it make sure it works
uh iterate and so on and so forth so
I'll jump into my logic all right
cool so this was the very last thing I
did which was the on object entered
which if anyone remembers this is where
when the player has scanned and found
the ship they have now entered the ship
so then what I put on their hood is like
locate and subdue void dude and then we
make sure that they can see that
objective and then
um see that sort of Hud and then we
start proximity tracker the proximity
tracker was the imperfect solution where
I we we don't have FPS scanning in the
Pu so
and I don't want to just mark them
straight away so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to wait until you're about 10
meters from them to then Mark them and
we might do something in the future
where we we um
you know I have a detection where if
they've see see if they see you if void
dude sees you then it also adds the
marker just to kind of help that along
so you don't accidentally shoot the
person you meant to subdue
um cool
so one thing next I needed to do was
um
and the other one I think I send some
modular AI spawn or cool cool just
checking everything remembering who I am
I haven't touched this in like a week so
I'm
I'm also trying to remember where I was
oh hold on go back to go back to bank uh
we apparently didn't record the intro
for the YouTube version so uh hi I'm me
that's him and we started in the middle
of the thing
continue
okay cool
so we have the object entered uh now I
just need to set up the stuff
for the air the proximity tracker so
when the proximity tracker tells me that
it's done
which is on entered range so when the
proxy the proximity tracker is tag is
triggered I'm gonna check to see if the
person who triggered it is a mission
player is a mission player
voila and I want to check that the
tracked object which is how I put the
variables in on object entered the
tracked object is the players and the
reference is the target can you zoom in
on that at all no like what's basketball
doing the center screen does it zoom in
doesn't zoom in nope no this is it can
zoom out is that better
can everyone read that
no that's as far and as we consume this
tool was built before we had 4K monitors
therefore it doesn't support 4K so you
either have to get really close to the
screen or have just really good eyes one
of the two
um we'll put that on the feature request
list it's already on there
um
the objective market so next up I can
see the rare thread Serge you didn't
have 4K monitors till when
Mission people who work in text didn't
have 4K money yeah we don't need 4K mods
this this is not beautiful you don't get
to see this grid this is what I have to
look at it doesn't have to be beautiful
all photographs are beautiful true well
that's not true actually I've seen some
really nasty flow graphs you want to see
uh because uh because I'm pretty sure
we'll close look at look at this look at
this
so
that all of these
here this is all of Siege Verizon and if
I was to open this up
you see how I can't click this because
it's loading it there's so much stuff in
here it has all of these functions
everything and this this is only a spit
that handles a small part of it and
inside of them all of the graphs are
absolutely absolutely huge I've got a
which is my horrible one
so so this we're building this obviously
we're only a couple minutes into this
week's show but if you watched last
week's show it's
this is one Siege of War this is one
aspect of Siege of Wars up here on the
left so so this this is this is one
module this is all the information that
I listen to on Siege Verizon and the all
these modules have about the same amount
of information in them just so I can
ensure that like every aspect covered
that every single thing in Siege of
right so so when everyone plays Siege
Verizon oh yeah you know it's it's
somewhat pretty simple you've got no the
thing took me seven months
not simple
um I've even there's even a graph that
just like when you're on it it lags when
you move around because of the amount of
nodes that are on it
um
and it's mainly because we've never had
anything with that amount of nodes
before so it it exposed performance
issue in the tour anyway away from Siege
away from my lifelong work to a much
simpler mission that we're building
today yeah exactly an easy one uh so the
players entered the range of void so now
I need to Mark void do to be killed so
um
I am going to put in the string which is
subdue and deliver
sub thing too and then uh targets cool
and then I'm gonna align that to the
this thing here which is the objective
and I'm going to set true so basically
what this is happening when the player
gets close enough to void I'm going to
Mark void
uh there was one thing I noticed when I
was clicking about in my functions which
was
this uh nope this
um
so where I set something up just to let
you know how how we think I set this up
last episode Target tag provided this is
if so this is where we start thinking
about how the designers work so if the
designer has given me a Target
uh I need to always take that however if
they've not given me a Target I'd pick
randomly so for example what I do in the
pre-init so this is before it has all
started I'm gonna drop down a global
function
that already exists that we built a
while back which is spawn description
has identified tags
um I'm going to set it to be any
Gabriel wolf says is there a Grappler
how many times you've complained about
the graph editor it's just a circle
it's just a never-ending work on Mission
complain about Mission release Mission
design Mission work on Mission so far
that's everything
cool right so set Boolean so what I'm
gonna do is I am going to check if the
NPC NPCs populate which is the record
that the design is going to provide me
that contains the NPCs has an identifier
tag
targets
Target there you go
and I'm gonna go through
I think it was funny sleeping tight
perfect so then if it does if if the
target tag has been provided to me by
the designer who used this because it
isn't just going to be me who uses this
stuff because it's all modular
um if they provided me this then I can
filter my logic differently so now for
example I'm not going to do it here but
like if I when I'm building this stuff
for wider use by other people what I
then do is I'd then go and build a
random system that will randomly pick
out a Target because if they've not
specified it to me then they'll want me
to just choose random because they don't
care like these are sort of like the
cases where you'll have in the future
where we want to build a bespoke boss
encounter so like where we spawn Mendo
or Remy and Siege they'd be bespoke so
that's where we'd want to care about
where they are
um or who they are or what their entity
is and that's what this this sort of
stuff was for
kill
um next stop
so we've got uh so next up what I do is
as assess because again what I have to
do is I build this and then I've got to
test it so I'm going to make sure that I
think everything's here that we do so
I'll I'll run through and I'll assess
everything I've done so I set the the
module location so it only streams in
when stuff I care about exists I start
the occupied ship spawner I get the
location object container I create my
objectives I Mark the location I create
my hood
I fill it for that when the location is
loaded in I fill up my action area so I
don't get crushed by a mint leaf
sailor zero zero says hi question why do
we need to know all this thank you uh
you don't watching the show is optional
continue
um
so I've registered my action area when
the player enters my action area
I check if my empty track is empty
I make sure and if so because if the tag
is not provided then I don't I don't
need to if the tag is provided the Mark
is already on the Target so I won't have
taken the mark away if the target isn't
there I will check to see if it's a
mission player remove remove the marker
that's telling them to go to the
location and make sure that the correct
text is on the screen perfect however
going through this it looks like either
I didn't make it or it didn't save the
on exit callback at the location action
area so that would be a quick one to
make
I was gonna say I thought you missed it
earlier but
I was taking a nap during the show
yes
I wish I could have done that as well
cool uh is entity tracker empty so I'm
going to check the same thing so I'm
going to check to see if the if the um
Target is empty if it is then I'm going
to check if it's a mission player
and then if it is a mission player uh
which is the incidentity
perfect I'm then going to check and then
I'm going to add the player to an
objective marker
um you think it probably wasn't made in
4k because most programmers have
terrible eyesight I'm staring at it it's
not quite possible
I'm gonna ask
I'm sorry
um so then I'm gonna mark them perfect
easy uh so now they're marked if they so
when they leave the area if they haven't
found the target I'll mark a ship so
they're nowhere to go
uh this event is sent by the occupied
ships spawner when any AI has been
spawned so I check is it a ship if it is
the ship I am going to
um
cast it to a ship variable set an a null
objective markup exist will handle the
marker and then I pass it in as a find
object by radar which is another module
module that's just going to handle
marking it for me when it's been scanned
by any of our scanning routes and then
I'll show the objective if it isn't a
ship it's a NPC I will add it to the all
occupiers in case I need it however if
the target tag
is provided so the design is giving me
it I then will check to see if the AI
That's calling back to me has that tag
if it does I'll add it and make it the
target which is perfect
cool uh
module complete that is kicked off
probably after you've knocked them out
uh when this is the one I've just gone
over so that's when you enter we start
approximately tracker when you knock out
void
um we remove the target objective marker
we add the target as it's beyond by a
mission so that we so the corpse doesn't
get cleaned up
um because it would if if NC spawning
was about
um we have a lot of stuff in the game
that like for example these these
corpses if we have loads of them in area
that chug your frame rate even more uh
so we have to make sure that we clear up
things that you
you know that we don't that we we don't
need so by saying this doesn't belong to
a mission if the entity density manager
system detects there are too many in a
cluster it will just start cleaning them
up to save your performance
um
yeah
it's hard ain't it yeah I'm thirsty
um and then so if you have not voided
out I'm going to start the delivery
module which is a part of the modular
delivery system and then I stop the
proximity tracker because you've knocked
them out you found them we don't we
don't care that you're there and to be
fair this proximity tracking node and
it's a good thing about reading about
your work
this can probably be put here because
when you've found them and I've marked
them I don't care about how close you
are to them because they have a marker
which is sorry just close through all of
these errors nice right there's more
have you done yep perfect
um cool
so
that's you've knocked them out this will
call back to me when that delivery
module is finished and that'll tell me
that the mission's over because you've
delivered the guy uh voidy so cool easy
peasy right now the next step The Next
Step takes us over to a new tool
the next tool is data fudge
date Forge is where we build our mission
records and fill out a lot of
information there
um
so I will add a record
and it's going to be a mission broker
entry and I'm just going to call it sub
to you subdue
and deliver
their liver yeah you know what that's
fine
cool
um so this is where uh this is where a
lot of the missions are built this is a
huge data graph that um
takes in a lot of inputs and changes how
the mission plays there's a lot of power
up here for example I have the power to
take a mission that is only allowed for
one person and only one of them is
allowed to be around at once and without
changing the logic I can make it so that
everybody in the server gets offered it
and pulled into the same logic and
that's what we do for things like the in
the wake of This Disaster the logic is
built just to care if the ships have
been scrapped and that's it but with the
data forward settings we're able to make
it kind of an open mission that kind of
can encourage PVP and other things
Keel so
I'm gonna
a uh owner so the owner would be me we
have these owner things just so because
we have a lot of missions we have a lot
of teams now that also help build
missions
um so we have to make sure that when uh
amazing QA Department put bugs in for
them for them they see like just the
narrative name so it will say like in
the way to disaster is an easy one but
we have bouncy ones that have like seven
different names uh why are you laughing
I don't get it because the way you
phrase it it sounds like the QA people
were the ones who created the bugs they
did create the books they give me the
books which I'm happy about I need books
they're saying there are no bugs bugs
don't exist until QA creates well no I
don't book my stuff I just it's like
Schrodinger's yeah exactly yes it's
neither buggy nor works until QA opens
the Box exactly exactly
um so they'll point in a bug and it will
be about like this bouncy Mission but
the bouncy Mission has a random name
random name generator type thing so the
name of the bounty Mission could be
called anything and it's difficult for
us to understand which record it alludes
to on our end so uh we have this
ownership thing where they can open up
the Bounty thing and go oh the mission
and go oh this one's for um someone in
Montreal and then we can assign it to
them quicker and which means the bug
gets resolved quicker as if they signed
it to us that's going to be like a
24-hour period until Montreal come
online not 24 hours but you know like
eight hours until they come online can
hit it anyway moving on
um next stop select file this is
referencing the mission module
um
so I'm gonna do I'm gonna place this one
in
um
yep so this is this is referencing the
logic that we have just created and what
I'm going to do is I'm going to be
cheeky because I've made a mistake
because I've got where I called this
Mission I'm going to right click and I'm
going to rename
this to actually be scheduled recover
and so it's aligned cool so this is all
called the logic this means when this
record starts it starts this module and
the module starts processing next up I'm
going to take the title of the mission
I'm going to drop that I'd drop that in
there
um I'll probably need to export in a
minute
um in here is where I drop the
description
um and then I drop the from line the
type these are all the mission types we
currently have this is what you see in
your Mobi glasses to where the mission
sort of exists I'm going to set this on
mercenary
so it's like typo or bug the same thing
I have a note on that which I'll speak
to you all about when I'm playing the
game
um okay right uh I won't I don't I can
go through all these settings but
there's tons of them and I just tell you
all to read my documentation but you can
so I'm gonna avoid it's explaining every
single one of them and you guys can all
just come up with your own idea of what
they do oh why start now I know right we
do want to get in and see how the
mission actually work exactly and if I
explain through every single one of
these there's a hell of a lot of a lot
of settings but I'll try high level them
reward this is where we give you a raw
reward that doesn't matter what value we
put in because you're all not happy with
it no matter what it is uh the location
mission available is where the where the
mission are generating
okay
the location mission available is where
the location would generate so this is
where we can say this Mission only stays
around uh Stanton too
um available date schedule this is for
stuff like when we do the like uh
Christmas missions Halloween missions
whatever like seasonal of things we do
we can also set it up here we have
reputation rewards journal entries
notifies when it pops up on your screen
there's the buy-in which is obviously
you buying in these ones are the most
powerful the max instances max players
per instance and Max instance per play
this is where we can play around with
how many of the missions can be active
at once how many you can accept and how
many one person can join into
can be shared uh which is obviously so
you can share with your friends once
only which is the mission can only be
done one we do these for a lot of story
missions so the Arlington gang missions
uh some of these are wants only is
because it doesn't make sense for you to
play them over and over again
um there's a bunch of fail-based ones so
if you send to prison if you become a
criminal or if you leave prison we can
fail missions
um these are again just more settings
that we can play with so we have respawn
time uh so that's how long the mission
takes to come back we have lifetime
that's how long it's up for without
being accepted abandoned cooldown so if
you abandon it how long so you can get
it back uh personal cooldown that's if
you complete it how long until we want
to give you another one and that's just
to make it so other people can play the
content as well
and uh don't care about any of this
stuff well you I won't tell you anything
about it law for Mission this is if the
mission is lawful or unlawful Mission
give a record this is how we link it to
say Ruto Pacheco
um Clovis all of them invitation Mission
uh This Is How We Do appointment
missions so we put an appointment in
here so we'd say this is Ruto and we
give an appointment Mission now the
appointment is if we want the player to
physically fly and go say hi to Ruto and
talk to them or talk to Miles or
whatever it's it's kind of like a
lead-in mission so you have to have a
mission available to you for you to play
before you get the invitation to go see
them we don't just do an invitation and
then there's no missions for you to play
it's generated based on what missions
you're eligible for beforehand
uh reputation prerequisites which uh
needs renaming at some point this is
just what wanted level you are
um and then a jurisdictional override
for example like Grim hex they have a
little bit of a little bit of a
difference
um in how they do law
uh reputation requirements this is how
how much reputation
um how much oh my God no it's not how
much for everything he's putting me off
it
it is the reputation required to get
this contract because this entry is
essentially a contract it's how much
reputation you need to get or what you
need to be equal to so we might have
fireable we might have
um
I'm going I've got oh my God it's half
past
um
required yeah all right I'm just going
to move on the rest of the settings can
wait but I can explain them on Spectrum
already if anyone actually cares
um so here comes here comes some of the
magic so this is where I'm gonna find
the location
so I'm gonna put this this word in here
mission location let's go BP which links
to this uh where is Amish and location
BP there you go that links to this and
basically it lets me Set uh information
from this side into the mission so I can
control uh things like what the location
does up here
um so for example what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna set in here
um I'm also going to need to type in
location here extended text token this
is how we dynamically populate those
Star Wars things that I was typing in
and talking about their tokens in here
I'm going to do a tag search for a
location now we can pick locations
specifically but to allow for some cases
of Randomness we might not want to
um so what I'm going to do in here is
is to get a mercenary mission location
I'm gonna restrict it
to Stanton
turn Stanton one missions locations
systems done and what so I'm going to
restrict his standard one so this is
where you'll see it and also because
mercenary Mission locations are applied
to both ground-based locations it's how
you have in atmosphere bounces
um I'm also going to make sure that you
can only do it in space
I'm then going to set up a resource tag
so a resource tag this allows us to say
how many missions are allowed at a
location at once because we don't want
more than one person doing a killer
Mission uh you know where you gotta kill
10 AI a singular location because if I
turn up and I've got 10 AI to kill and
you've got 10 AI to kill I'm either
going to just wipe out your 20 or I'm
going to kill 10 and then leave 10 and
that just is weird
um
so yeah that's that next up we need to
set up boy voidy's name
so in here this is where I would add the
target name token which is what uh we
have I'm going to set it to mail
and then I would for example I'd put in
voidy's name here and then that I'd bind
to avoid his name and then you can see
in game it'd show their name now this
normally we'd leave random so it has
that element randomless Randomness but
for Missions like the Arlington mission
that is where we wouldn't uh leave that
next up we have the occupied ships BP so
this is the um
Gonna Fill in this so this is gonna be
the ship that we want to spawn
again I'm going to do a tag search
tags
nope ship spawn description that's what
I want so this is a special spawn
description thing that will allow us to
see
um
uh like it will allow us to see sort of
um
the ship and build this like cookbook
recipe I know I've talked about the
cookbook recipe oven thing
um
so this is how we're going to find the
ship so the ship that we want is a uh
reclaimer
because that's a new fun with and we're
going to look for the mission overlay
setup reclaimer
and I'm also going to make sure just for
safety that I'm looking for the ship tag
as well uh just to make sure that
I don't find anything else for me
because there's a lot of tags on a lot
of things
and I have to make sure that I
definitely know which one I'm getting
uh cool so this will essentially find
that ship that's tagged up as reclaimer
so in here all the way up in our ship
thing we have a ship entity record it'll
live in wherever the entity folder is
which is all the way up here so in here
we'll have a record that represents the
reclaimer with a bunch of like level
design markup and it'll have tags on it
so essentially we can find that via tags
and reference it in our mission
um it's just a very quick way of finding
stuff now this property the next one
this is the only one that I've pre-built
um because we so we have these sort of
NPCs that we would we want to spawn on
these occupied ships and we've built it
to a certain level
um where we know like oh we want 10 here
we want five here we want three here and
that's like a pre a predetermined amount
because we've played it and we've gone
okay this is this little bit of the
reclaimer the cockpace form of two
people and in this cargo area the
reclaimer is fun with like five people
in so we've pre we've pre-built this and
it's a lot of setup to do and I have I'm
at half pasta
you're watching the single most accurate
cig presentation ever
before we started Elliott told me this
last part would only take 10 minutes
only at twitch.tv Star Citizen
estimations are difficult
I'm gonna get for me
okay so uh this is so I've just pasted a
load of information in here as you can
see they're all down here but
essentially what this is this is the NPC
spawn description this contains a lot of
the information for how we find NPCs
and spawn them because again an NPC is
an actual record so it it's all the way
up there with its Loadout its AI
activity uh it's it's uh armor it wears
and all of this fun stuff that we have
on it so the best way for me to find it
is not to specify it manually it's use a
generic tag search because I can use a
generic tag search to go generically or
I can put all the tags that that one
entity would have on it to find the
specific that I want but because I want
to try to keep it random I'll just use
some generic text so the generic Tags
I'm using right now are nine tails and
armed um so that's just going to find me
a nine sales person that's armed and I
don't want a boss because you can't take
them down and I definitely don't want
the career boss
um I've excluded ship crew because they
don't have the right activities and also
they don't have pretty good armor
uh we have the Min and Max group size
um so this is uh what size of a batch
they can spawn in we have the concurrent
spawns and the max bonds so the
difference between these is I could put
Max bonds to -1 and I could say
concurrent spawns of 10 and that had
infinitely spawn NPCs for me as long as
it didn't violate the current spawns of
10 and that's sort of like how we do in
Siege uh constant AI coming out is that
I say this area should always support 10
people but I want unlimited so when
there's nine people it'll queue up an
extra spawn of one uh and so on and so
forth
there's a bunch of extra settings on
here like we can add stuff to the
inventory we can choose a specific
closet or Room Mission Allied Market
means that they'll get a friendly marker
over their head identify a tag so this
is where the user would come in here and
then add the tag of Target that I look
for in logic and then this allows them
to make a very specific person
and say this is where I want them to
spawn which I have one down here
uh I've spelled Target wrong but this
here is an example of where I have void
dude Target yeah I have void dude and
I've specified them as a Target and I've
put them only to one because they should
spawn they'll spawn with other people
but in that thing it's saying I this is
the one tag you had if I had more than
one person in there all five of them
would be targets and we don't want that
kill so that is the NPC NPC ships to
populate next stop we have the um
Mission item so this is uh until we get
a proper coded system for the uh for the
delivery thing it's all handled by Logic
we want to eventually have a properly
built thing around here I can say
delivery and it has a predefined sort of
setup and structure to it so there's
sort of like some hacky things I have to
do to get around it for example how I
Define what type of drop-off I want and
when I say type I mean
um
like you can drop off to a shelf
um you can drop off to a locker you can
put it in an action area or you can
and drop off to a satellite with Maxi's
new missions in the prison where you put
a satellite chip in
um so how we specify that is I have to
specify a item
which is kind of like a fake item
which will beat of type delivery action
area which basically when this feeds in
it just tells my system
to care uh care and do the one that is
the action area drop off at the end of
the whole Loop
uh next up is the destination
so this is where the ending point of
where I want you to go uh to drop the
Target off
so next I'm gonna find that that
location
um so
sometimes it should be location nice and
I'm gonna do a match condition
and then I'm going to do a tag search
so in here I am going to specify that I
want you to take it to an outpost and
stand on one uh derelict Outpost
probably because it doesn't make sense
to take a void dude's lifeless not
lifeless unconscious corpse
uh to a
what do you call it uh and like an
active Outpost because I'm pretty sure
they admin guide be like oh what are you
doing
cool and I'm also going to make sure
that it only happens in Stanton one
nice
and then the last last thing that I need
to add to this record
is the objective setup so this is just
so uh the delivery system knows what the
item's called so we can put a marker on
it if you was to drop it and this will
just be of type string hash and then in
here for example what I do is I'm going
to drop the literally just the token
that is going to pull void's name
from these things so this would be
void's name uh which is Mission Target
name so that's going to dynamically pull
void's name from this whole thing uh so
then if you drop him he has a name the
other things that like I have power to
do for example on this record here I can
embed a ship name
on the ship so for example here I could
put on the
name of void ship on if I wanted so I
could just like I don't know I'd name it
something like
all good ships because that's his
catchphrase if you've heard it I can't
do South African accent but he goes put
all good ships have a name
that went terrible sorry void
um
me a camera one
not only are you okay not me
I deeply apologize for Elliot Malby and
the views and opinions of his do not
represent those of cloud Imperium games
Robert Space Industries turbulent uh
this basement that we're in uh Pete our
audio guy anybody
sorry
carrying on
um when I scroll down on this so next up
is the very last thing which is he
Jesus Christ I know I know I keep saying
very lastly this is the actual very last
thing for me I promise you
um I just need to add the mission to the
I'm pretty sure it's the last thing
um but here's the thing you keep working
you keep working
this seems like it's taking a long time
but the reality is that we are crafting
a mission from scratch using the amazing
tools that our subsumption team and our
data forward team and our robo-hessie
team really have created and the fact
that we we're going to get it and dear
Lord I hope it runs you need to keep
working no I'm I'm ready to move on to
the next part if it works this is
incredibly fast
it's
actually very fast an hour and 40
minutes to make a mission is in insane
if it works if it works if it doesn't
work
I'm going to Germany not coming back all
right cool okay so
last but not least so I I've added this
is the Pu missions this contains every
single Mission
um and I've dropped in a subdue and
recover so the next thing is I would
boot my server
cool we'll tell you when you go back to
the screenshot
so we're going to boot our server now in
this instance uh booting an internal
server takes a while we talked a little
bit about that uh last week
we have had a server running in the
background during this and we're just
going to send this information over and
hope uh it stays up and running you
ready yep okay so that one needs to go
away
sure yes and this one yep no no no
that's the game that's what we want to
say that screen needs to go away I need
to add the C bus
and pull that one off
you want me to move this ever away as
well cool yes
uh what is that box right there that is
a beautiful picture of Conor Allenby
okay and now you got to make this bigger
oh okay I normally play in Windows and
the reason I'm playing Windows is
playing window just make the window
bigger yeah yeah yeah it's just when I'm
building I have to I actively change
things as I'm building so it's quick for
me to Tab out and then yeah uh where is
it as well
that one
okay is that big enough do you want a
bigger sure sure
can't go anywhere hey
go to the last one
okay you still go over there it's still
windowed true true
all right you switch back now
hello
okay so I'm in game
[Music]
um so
full transparency I have put uh god mode
and bottomless mags on and the reason
I've done that is because when we're
doing this we're like in the Prototype
phase so me playing it naturally isn't
important it's making sure that it works
making sure everything spawns and then
if it does I then go back and go right
okay I'm gonna start like doing it
properly to see the experience we're
also not going to have any sound on this
because I didn't think about it until
just this very moment
there we go
um so next thing I'm doing is I am
forcing myself a Loadout uh so I've got
guns because I don't want to spend my
time going to the shop so we have the
mft loadout that I've crafted so I'll
apply that it will give me in a second
I'll get a body uh you know I'm just
gonna have to full screen this
which is quite risky because that could
have crashed
cool uh so now I have a body
I have a buddy uh so I have my inventory
um
I have all of my stuff that I might need
so I've got tractor beams this is like a
very big testing like Loadout it has a
lot of stuff that I might need and next
up I'm gonna Force the mission
which is to do SUB Doom recover so this
allows me to force Mission because
even though you guys have to wait
naturally because it's a generator for
you to unlockify reputation I just need
to test it so I'm going to force it so I
didn't done that and now we have to wait
for it to
spawn loud uh missions are actually
entities so they have to spawn like
everything else in our game
um so they'll be in a spawn queue why is
that
um
you're asking the wrong person I I don't
know it's my decoder who's a hell of a
lot smarter than me goes these need to
be
um you have to narrow that down yeah
that's a lot of people
David my David
um
it has it'll probably have a reason I
just don't know it but it's not anything
that I can really just like argue with
because
what do I know why'd you make missions
and half of them don't even work uh
right I need to check there's not an
asset
hello
cool no assets we're all clear
so an asset is something that pops up in
when you're testing
um to say that something has gone wrong
but it can recover from it so it doesn't
crash
um
you can't leave it you can't do a full
screen you have to leave a window yeah
okay you said there's even a big window
well that's fine because the Game just
crashed on me
that's what it went yeah
you can pick a full screen leave it as a
very big window
so yes uh if you're wondering why we
haven't shown the screen for a while it
crash
cool
um this is this is where I wanna
let's let's let's have let's have a
conversation about this while while we
boot up here no you still do your thing
you know you have to look like you're
working though
um
there is there is the live game
environment and everybody knows you know
you know how that is and what that is we
don't need to go into that here then
before that there's PTU Wave 2 before
that you know it's a bit more unstable
and then before that there's PTU wave
one then before that there's Eva cotty
you know where where it's generally uh
so bad and and and unstable than
anything we you know we we we we try to
you know it try to keep it out of the
ice as much as possible then before that
is where will Dave and Alex from the ISC
gameplay capture team that's where they
have to do all their work
so you know you know pour a drink out
for the for the for the for the people
who make the b-roll in ISC uh each and
every week because they are working on
pre-vacotti builds in whoo but before
that
or where developers work
where the developers and the QA work uh
so yeah so a crash is not an uncommon is
not a surprising thing to happen
especially you know it just yeah you
boot it up and it's like yep it is you
know most of the time it isn't anything
issues because we're constantly an
active development so there's just all
this stuff coming in and sometimes
you'll hit some think that someone else
didn't hit like a sprig of mint and it
she'll sit down here now the server
stayed up it was just the client that
crashed
oh no it was the server that went down
yes he's currently booting yeah I know
foreign
a here because the server booty takes a
little while over some of the questions
we collected some of the questions we
brought from last week so uh a few
people were calling me out on spelling
uh yeah I can't spell really can't
um it's not a prerequisite no but the
the good thing is that um their coders
make it safe so we don't have to spell
um so whenever I'm doing variables and
subsumption the the name of it is purely
front facing so I understand what
information I've injected into that
variable but behind the variable it has
a unique uh guide uh guid to which the
code uses so it doesn't use my spelling
so if I spell it delivery here and
delivery there it doesn't matter because
it the number of the variable is what
links it
um so my spelling errors usually don't
really matter it obviously matters when
it's a code of doing it because they're
unprotected but they protect people like
me because I can't spell
um
cool
um
someone asked if if we have fail safes
in place uh for when objects don't get
streamed in uh as the mission might
break uh in some areas we do in some
areas we might withdraw the mission if
ever you see a withdraw it's because
Something's Happened in the back end
that we've detected that we know we
can't handle so we just have to take it
away from you and then we would see that
withdrawal on the mission on our
analytics page and we'd be able to go in
and sort of investigate as to why that
happened so we do have some things in
place there are other things you might
have noticed where you're doing a
delivery Mission and the marker is on
the ground underneath that's basically
that marker is on the OC route of the
entire location while we're waiting for
the location to stream in and everything
that I need to be loaded for it to then
assign you your delivery pot
uh someone else asked are these the
tools that I use to build PvP missions
yes it's all one tool Suite so any
Mission logic is built in subsumption
just when you make a PVP Mission you
have more Hate in Your Heart yeah yeah
it's more about like how am I going to
pick players against players and that's
the fun bit
um
someone asked me if
when a mission chain breaks so an NPC
doesn't spawn for example is that
typically due to a link in this chain
being broken so the chain that was on
about is me connecting my nodes together
and the answer is uh no usually that
could be to do anything everything has
to go for a spawn queue and sometimes
that spunk you can get very backed up
because we have a lot of stuff in our
game so you could be at your location
waiting and someone's just gone to micro
Tech and that planet kind of needs to be
there first because that's an entire
planet you're gonna either go into it
and it's gonna spawn around you and
you'll die or whatever so there are
things that are priorities and cues and
the queue system can be huge but we're
constantly working on it to try and make
it more efficient and make it so that
less requests are handled and things
like server meshing should help because
the spawn queue would be dedicated to
each like thing that runs that area
um
was last one is there any programmers on
the mft similar to how VFX have
programmers yes we have David polan we
have Mark prades Calder I'm sorry I'm
going to destroy some of these people's
names uh we have Mark Mansell Mikhail
geek
sorry Mikhail
love that guy and Josh kitchen they're
all about they're all our programmers on
our team
um
right we can go back to my screen I just
need to make it bigger the missions on
I've loaded in game I can't speak I
barely speaking no I'm just gonna I'm
just gonna end like at least six
sentences the next week with it and Josh
kitchen and Josh kitchen yeah Josh
kitchen he's one of our newest
programmers he's doing great you keep it
fine just leave it like that just live
like that Josh kitchen stop stop playing
with it oh okay that's fine okay then
cool
see everything
you what
that was for making a full screen before
all right uh hold on move
see I don't just break missions this is
going really well
10 minutes for me to show you the
mission
if you try to turn it off yeah we're
gonna do that we're gonna do this thing
here
and oh
oh that's even worse
oh that's even worse
is it lost the
yeah
Jared has to go behind the desk hold on
talk to the people Elliot read some
questions read some questions go and
then everyone ask me questions I'm here
now
did he delete the game by mistake no
glad this show isn't live otherwise this
part of br oh yeah there's no chance
this show is live at all who's your
daddy and what does he do what's your
daddy not answering what does he do
what's for lunch it's 5 p.m I'm gonna
have tea
why are you the worst Devon Sig
I have no clue but thank you who's that
Luke uh you know what yeah it could be
why are you two time on the two-time for
a reason do you play 40K I do yes you
back David yes
okay
do the thing how much do you bench
nobody asked that you added legit
someone put it in here someone asked to
how much I bench Okay so
uh I've accepted the mission
which is here
um but it looks like some of the strings
have broken so we won't see some of the
strings uh usually this is because uh
when you when you're making strings live
you have to make sure you export them to
the game if you don't export them to the
game
um it uses the pack file strings and
it's something you have to remember
every time you shut down the client and
reopen it you have to constantly export
to the game so we're gonna have no
strings but that's fine
um because I can tell you what it oh
what is on the screen so what I've just
done is I've gone into F3 mode which is
no clip
um because again the important part of
my flow is being at the mission and
playing the mission so flying there
isn't a part of it not until I need to
start testing naturally but again I'm
just testing to see if it works so I'm
going to F3 I've been a third person
yep
this is
I don't have Eva it doesn't take you
into EBA it's literally just like you're
flying As You Are
cool so I'm going to get a bit closer
faster than any ship
can do it
here's the planet
loading in
a bit closer to the mission location
cool which is here nice I'm gonna get
get around about here so I've entered
the area
um so it knows where I am and oh I need
to so he knows where I am so at this
point this is where it's like locate uh
the sparkle uh so I have to locate the
ship via scanning now again because I
skipped the whole Aesop stuff uh I'm
just gonna v-spawn the Cutlass
um which is a quick way of being able to
just just spawn a ship again quick
testing it's about like getting in
getting in and texting you can't test
any content I'm gonna make sure that God
Mode's on so I don't die and we have to
restart this whole process
god mode there you go and bottomless
mags cool and basically then all I do is
at this point the player would be going
around and looking for the ship
um and scanning a but right now this
light is blinding me and I can't really
see much on my screen so in this case
what I might do is I might turn on unlip
mode for myself and I can see stuff
makes it look horrible yes but again I'm
here to test stuff works
so I'm going to look around and try find
the ship
we can't do full screen Zoro it's what
caused the problem before
oh there we go
so there's the ship and there's the
macron my God it's working chairs
touch wood
uh so there's the ship
so next up I would infiltrate the ship
um but again I
I'm playing purely for functionality to
make sure it works so I'm gonna I'm
Gonna Fly there
there we go
so here's the reclaimer
the all good ships reclaimer void is
reclaimer
um and next thought what I'm going to do
is I'm going to come in the air lock
so at this point because I've as a
developer at this point because I've
cheated a lot of the way here I need to
uh chill for a bit and went out why I
say chill and what I mean by chill is
um
I've beaten streaming on a lot of cases
uh so I have to make sure that the spawn
cue slowly works it weighs down at all
of my stuff spawns so I what I do
usually is I'd sit here for a hot minute
uh just while I wait for everything to
spawn
um turn the light back to normal oh yeah
I'll turn the lighting back now Ian
doesn't come after me
so here we go atmospheric torch on uh so
now what my plan would be is that um I
made the mission so you have to find uh
boy voidy so at this point I would be
searching searching around to see if I
can spot voidy
there you go occupied ships and now
there's AI on it and we've put markups
this is stuff Nick echo's been working
on uh put mark up oh we have an asset
this is the thing I was on about this is
something is broken
um but it's one it's telling me that it
can continue without it crashing so what
our QA would do is they would
they would ensure that they bug all of
like they'd report all these assets and
then each team will get these assets oh
clicked out
um
to make sure
there we go there's another one
the right receiver has to turn these off
but we usually leave them on so we can
see stuff like for example there might
be an asset that I've caused I keep
clicking off them on the screen yep
there might be an asset that I've caused
and this is my only way to figure it out
I I forget uh cool so yeah at this point
I'm looking around trying to find voidy
Where You Are
sneaking around
so I'm going to call the elevator and
I'm going to head down into some of the
other areas so what do we got
processing hold I'll go to the cargo
hold maybe voidy sneaking around there
counting his mouth you don't actually
know where he's at no I've got no clue
there's a randomizer element that we put
in there yeah yeah pretty much you can
have a specify where they are you can
randomize it um I can't remember where I
put voidy but cargo hold you know we
might be in here holding his maze
smelling it having a nice time with it
avoidy
are you here ah hello
how did you survive that oh they've
dropped their weapons so
um
so these things are where we'd find
issues like this and we'd report and
like get these fixed up before
um he's holding before we put it out
um I'm just gonna murder hobo everybody
uh yep nice right now you need to go
back out voidy isn't in here
and this is places where we'd find like
server performance uh like and we'd look
at that and how it affects the mission
because there might be like we have the
proximity tracker in but there could be
the server currently I'm running it
locally so it's kind of like not going
to be accurate but the server forms
could be pretty low to the point where
the proximity tracker can't update quick
enough
um
so I can actually see it oh it's this
way uh so I'm in another area
oh waiting for me
that knocking people up
you wanna there you go again I've got
good old mode on so I don't really need
to care about the damage but please
would get out of here
you as well
anyone else
oh oh there you go there's the marker
I've come close enough to void dude that
I know where he is and I would be able
to go up this little bit here but that
because that's the the bit that leads up
but uh I can't climb up there so I'm
gonna
go all the way back and try and knock
voidy out
I'm coming
uh is that the next floor
world's slowest elevator come on
all these friends have come out to play
no scope
[Music]
cool here we go voidy me and you
've gone so next up uh as you can see I
now have a drop-off marker I have
um voided they should say void dude he's
not in his normal armor oh hello
of course so in the next stop I grab
void and then I
what happened to your infinite mags uh I
keep thinking I've got the um oh my God
no one saw that no worries no worries
uh I it thinks I've got a different gun
in my hand that's why there you go
and then I'm missing all my shots die
where are you where have you gone
saw it right now back to my multi-tool
cool and now we
there you go we grab void
wait dude
cool uh I think
I think there's a bug in where if
they're unconscious you can't track to
be in them yeah there you go okay so the
mission would obviously fail if you
murdered boy dude because you are here
to subdue and deliver but due to that
bug and the fact that I haven't built
the hole if you kill them the mission
fails because again just testing for the
feeling I've left him killable so now
avoid uh
well you can actually move with me right
next up
um so this is the quick keyword blame a
bug and it was clearly a skill issue
yeah that's what we did that's all we do
all that you jump straight to oh it's a
buck
Not For a Moment considering that you
were just bad I moved him twice and he
shot back to his original location
because you were bumping him into stuff
bumping him into stuff he was rebounding
clearly it's void's issue it's your
issue voidy
cool uh next up I'm out the ship and I
need to get a ship to then take me back
and I can't bother to go get my other
ship so I'll spawn a fresh one
and then I'm going oh my God third per
thank you how close am I yeah it's all
right so next up I need to put voidy in
the ship
yep
so I'm going to open up the back
uh there he is
boy dude
come on
I'm trying to be careful because if I go
too fast he'll detach from my tractor
beam
and I'm using no clip mode so it's a bit
quicker
so this is what bounty hunting B2 looks
like absolutely not voodoo
no definitely not
shot him through the door open it's
pretty good
there you go right
avoid yellow
why are you still carrying him around uh
what void yeah
he's in the ship already you need to
make sure he's comfortable in yeah
I might have killed him I'm not rude
now if it lets me into the seat there
you go
um now
called the star map and set a
destination
I appreciate the way you've ordered that
I have to tackle the star map
I this is where I want to remind
everybody
I've said it before I'll say it again
I'm saying it now
every single thought you've ever had
about Star Citizen every single comment
you've ever made in twitch or YouTube or
just in the privacy of your own home
we've had them all we've said them all
and we were doing it long before it's
you're we're just like you and you're
just like us
good ways and not
yeah like Elliot's skill issue and
blaming bugs for skill issues listen it
was clearly a book
okay right now I just need my QT to
happen
there we go and now I just need to try
to drop them off
um
we can we can assume that you know we're
already in time we don't need to keep
yeah I mean the delivery module is
something that has been working
for quite some time so uh This Bar would
be pretty explanatory you take voidy you
drop him off in a location uh Bob's your
uncle
actually Carl was my uncle oh sorry
sorry Carl
but there you go Mission worked first
time
yeah now who can't make missions
he's not getting the crash
um
so yeah so thanks that's it uh we're
gonna assume he goes back to stand in
one Stanton one is what we call
internally which one is that oh
assistant sorry Kristen Kristen yeah we
use Stanton one two three and four but
they obviously you know as Michael Tech
Crusader blah blah
um
that's it how you feel Elliot yeah good
uh it took a bit longer but
we got it working it's it's like it's
not it's not a simple process to make
missions it takes a while and then like
for example I'm not even halfway
finished because after this I'd go back
and we'd we'd look at it as a team we'd
iterate we'd improve we'd have a look at
how we could make it better like what
happens if you have to manage void is
like food and water like you have to
feed him would that make it more of an
interesting gameplay Loop then because
right now what I did with voidy he is
essentially a box in a different form
um so having that extra gameplay of
feeding him making sure he stays uh
healed up and things like that and that
you don't die you know we could have
reinforcements come after to try and
reclaim him and you have to protect him
and all that sort of stuff makes more
interesting gameplay but considering
that in less than two hours we did a
first pass V1 of a mission and you know
asserts aside and I think it functioned
yes it functioned everything that we
needed it to do did it for the first
version yeah so like I said now we were
iterating anything so yeah that is a uh
uh it's still a very brief and extended
but but still a very brief look at the
mission creation process
um I want to thank
um I'm sorry what was your name again
Elliot Elliott uh and all the members of
the mission feature team for their
fantastic work as well as the you know
the folks behind subsumption the folks
behind data Force folks behind Robo
Hesse I feel like we have to shout hessy
out of you know you know Andrew Hesse
um uh poor went out for Jake muley and
Ben Dorsey
um
that's it for this week's show uh we got
a couple housekeeping uh things and then
we're gonna we're gonna throw the raid
over to uh one of our star Citizens
We're playing
um next week is Gamescom Gamescom is the
yearly convention out in Cologne Germany
it is one of if not at this point with
EA kind of retired it might be the
biggest video game convention in the
world right now that that's happening
next week there are three
three consecutive bar citizens going on
next week in Cologne they're on Thursday
night Friday night and Saturday night
you can check out the
robertsbaseindustries.com website for
details
um
also citizen con citizencon is just
about nine weeks away uh that's the now
two day event uh that's going on October
20th and 21st uh is there the 21st or
22nd 20th what somewhere around there uh
that's in Los Angeles California at the
Los Angeles Convention Center uh by far
the biggest citizen con we've ever
attempted uh tickets for that are still
available also on the robertsbase
industries.com website and because of
Gamescom
uh being next week and then we're having
a summit in the Frankfurt office
afterwards and because of citizencon
moving off of its traditional 1010 day
and being a little a little later in the
month in October we are shifting the
weekly video Cadence uh for the next
week for the next two months really uh
every quarter
make sure everybody's paying attention
every quarter we produce approximately
10 episodes of uh inside Star Citizen we
are still going to produce 10 episodes
of inside Star Citizen but we are going
to introduce a one-week Hiatus uh next
week uh that's going to that's going to
allow us to push our content even closer
to Citizen con without having a big
month-long gap between our last episode
of ISE and the beginning of season gone
so still all the same episodes still all
the same stories uh basically we're
going to take a break next week come

episodes of the quarter all is
originally intended and then there will
