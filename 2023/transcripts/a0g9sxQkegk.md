hey before we get on to the normal
business of inside Star Citizen this
week we wanted to take a moment and
recognize and acknowledge what's
currently happening with the live
gameplay experience
obviously anyone that's been following
the project for any period of time knows
that running a live gameplay environment
throughout the process of development is
an unusual sometimes trying but often
rewarding experience
but it's not just the tremendous work of
our developers that make this possible
it's also the continuing commitment of
you our players that allow us to test
things at scale because it's often easy
to forget that with the hype and
excitement of a new release that every
level of Star Citizen is a development
and testing platform
even the live Alpha now
even knowing that the launch of alpha
318 was going to be rougher than normal
I think it's fair and safe to say that
we were all hoping for a somewhat
smoother experience and the one that you
have been finding the last week now
while I'm going to continue I'm going to
continue pointing you to the amazing
efforts of our platform team the player
experience team and especially the
community team in updating you on the
continuing progress through the website
and socials because quite frankly
they're far more plugged into those
things than I am and will have much
better information than I ever will we
did feel it was important to acknowledge
the current state of things at the top
of this show whose story was set weeks
and months before
I said it on SEO and I'll say it again
here we don't just share in the
victories with each and every one of you
we're often right there with you with
the same thoughts and the same feelings
about our disappointments
we're sorry for the rough launch but I
hope you can see the determination and
the dedication of those people working
to improve things in the improvements
that are being made each and every day
this week and will continue until we get
things where we want them to be
so with that said
let's get started with this week's show
since the launch of the persistent
Universe in December 2015 Mission
gameplay has been at the center of the
Star Citizen experience whether that's
doing someone a favor and investigating
a few ycc probes delivering an important
package from one planet to the next or
infiltrating a gang of would-be near do
Wells and efforts to keep Stanton safe
missions often push players forward into
areas they might not otherwise have
discovered and pull them deep into the
scandalous underbelly of the star system
and over the years through the work of
the mission feature team missions have
continued to evolve into a modular
system that allows for designers
anywhere in any Studio to create
missions not in the weeks and months of
2015 but in the mere days of 2023
so on this week's inside Star Citizen
let's learn a bit more about how that
modular system works the technical
complexities that make it possible and
take a peek at some of the new modules
currently in development for Alpha 319
and Beyond
[Music]
good you can do it I can do it missions
matter no missions modules Elliott
Maltby Mission modules you're at scene
five mission modules Lars scene 5.
I always wanted to do that
at the very beginning
the early days everyone was just coming
up with missions right what we used to
have to do is have a bespoke mission for
every Mission we had someone might have
built it to act this way and then
another person might have built it to
act this way but in a completely
different way so one person would start
like a delivery Mission would have to
write it from beginning to end and then
some other person wouldn't have write a
bounty Mission from beginning to end and
then another delivery Mission Again from
beginning to end and the problem with
that situation was that
um everyone wrote their scripts
differently each Mission while might
have similarities
every bit of logic was different in some
way we are a game that constantly
evolves it constantly gets updated so
things break sometimes we used to get
bugs back which was like oh you know
that when we enter the action area for
this this Mission this happens but it
wouldn't happen on the other one even
though they're functionally doing the
same thing everything was built in a
different way and so everything also
needed to be fixed individually it was a
lot of reworking and redoing and over
and over again and eventually that could
not be skilled up anymore in a game like
Star Citizen where we really want to
populate the entire universe with
missions we can't really do that we have
to come up with a different solution we
don't need all these people working on
all these things all over the place if
we can have more of a unified approach
towards it that's where Mission Logics
come in
foreign
to fix all of those issues is a more
modular system this is where we identify
key functionality between missions and
plug them all together and make it all
operate under one module this means that
when we get a bug it is likely that
every other Mission will experience this
bug and we can fix it so we have modules
and sub modules and sub-modules and
there is no answer that you can keep
putting them inside of each other but on
the high level we have what are called
wrapper modules so some of the different
wrapper modules are like delivery
missions your typical delivery mission
is pick up a box and then deliver the
Box in another location which has
certain variations so we have ones that
are called multi-stop which are
essentially uh here's five boxes uh
here's the pickup locations and here's
all the drop-off locations the player
can decide in what order they want there
are the linear wrapper module which is
we give you one box and you have to
deliver that before we then give you the
next box infiltrate and offend has like
various subtypes and different
variations that we can use depending
what the mission wants to achieve you've
got to eliminate all missions or you've
got eliminate specific missions or even
eliminate boss mission where players
must neutralize the grunts first and
then afterwards a Boss shows up and
that's the eliminate Target and those
are all the sub modules of the
infiltrate and defend type and we're
still making more then is the bounty
hunting modules are about emissions are
quite well known the most basic version
is you accept a contract it tells you
where the Bounty is you travel there and
you take it out which then can be
modified in like several variations it
consists of the synced assassinations
it's the group bounces where you have
three different bounces at different
locations you have to get to and kill
it's the Idris event where you have to
go and kill it Idris with potentially
multiple people you don't know and when
the ability to capture people comes
online will add even more modules to
help support this
so what we're working on now is resource
collection missions that includes
Salvage and Mining missions we're even
gonna be adding classic things like um
someone wants 40 pieces of Wheat and you
have to go and find that and bring that
back to them all of these things we're
looking into investigating hopefully
you'll see soon
no Reddit that's just an example we're
not actually going to collect weight
foreign
so let's dive deeper into sub modules
and let's use one that looks relatively
simple the delivery module the delivery
module uses a wrapper called the
multi-stop delivery so when that fires
that starts something called the
initialized delivery Loop the initialize
delivery Loop reads parameters that
designers give us say how many boxes
they want to be delivered for this
example let's say three so those three
boxes would start three individual round
deliveries now a round delivery will
care and track the progress of a
singular box and it's Journey from point
A to point B so then after that round
delivery has booted up and it has all
the information that then goes right now
I need to start the first part of it
which is the pickup part so it starts to
pick up or drop off module which then
will check what has a designer specified
to me does the designer care where this
is spawned do they want a locker do they
want a certain item Port if they don't
it will choose randomly so let's say
they go okay I want it to be picked up
from a item Port which is essentially
what you know as a shelf
the image spawned on a shelf and it sits
there waiting when the player interacts
with the item and picks it up it sends a
call back back to the pickleball dropper
and say this item's been retrieved the
pickle oil drop-off goes my job's
complete let me tell the round delivery
the round delivery then goes okay thank
you for that information I can now start
the drop-off process because the box
that I had been told to pick up has been
picked up it will then say I'm gonna
boot the pickup or drop off again but
this time it will specify the drop-off
process once again taking into account
anything that the design has specified
if they want it dropped off in a locker
or at a shelving unit again say this
time it's a locker then what happens is
it will boot up a completely different
module of the delivery Locker then that
will send the request to the delivery
locker and say hey delivery Locker
you're going to expect X item from X
person the delivery Locker then Waits
when you put it in the delivery Locker
the delivery Locker will verify that the
item is the one that was actually asked
for you to be delivered and then it will
once again send an event back up to the
pickup far drop off going hey I've got
the right item that'll go cool thank you
send that over to the round delivery the
round delivery will go well that's my
box gone I've finished I'm gonna send
this up to the initialized delivery Loop
the initialized delivery Loop goes
that's one out of three now delivered it
will then repeat this process for the
other two boxes that can be done in any
order then when that completes all over
together the initialized delivery Loop
will go cool all of my things have been
finished I'm going to send it up to the
multi-stop if the multi-stop will then
go that's my mission over complete you
get your money and it's as simple as
that the reason we set this up like this
is because it allows us to quickly plug
pieces in for example the prison Mission
had to expand on the delivery system to
allow you to pick up from a corpse and
drop off to a satellite as a sort of
upload function what this means is we
didn't have to create another delivery
module to do that specific process we
created two ending modules of pickup
corpse and upload data those live at the
end so after to the pickleball drop off
has run its course it would just pick
those two which means we don't have to
add specific functionality to the entire
module all over it only has to be at the
end
[Music]
so I guess you really want to hear about
some of the new stuffs so let's talk
about Salvage modules the Salvage module
is currently a singular module and what
we have done is allowed for a bunch of
functionality the most simple version is
you get your contract in your Mobi glass
given by a company that has Salvage
rights you accept mission in Moby glass
and then it's going to give you a piece
of Salvage and it says well we have a
piece of Salvage for you and it's
located at this LaGrange point the
player is shown a location where a
shipwreck can be found so they make
their way there and it could be that
another NPC is there salvaging already
or you could have an illegal variant of
the mission where you have to go there
and Salvage everything quickly before
another player that has the contract
legally shows up but there's going to be
time on screen of whenever the legal
owner of that Salvage gonna appear which
can end up in uh enemies arriving
because he calls them in we've made
several sub modules that allow to work
with it so the first one is spawn ship
waves so it's going to be a wave based
module that allows the designer to
Define what the waves are like exactly
and then they show up and another module
that we've been making that we're
actually quite proud of is the chicken
ship module and that's a ship that shows
up and then is either going to attack
you or try to run away and if you scare
It Off by either damaging it or taking
too long it's gonna try and jump away
and if it does so then
it allows the designer to Define what's
going to happen then so the most basic
version would be he's going to call his
friends they come in and then all of a
sudden it's not you and a vulture
against another vulture it's going to be
you against Retaliator bomber and four
arrows and you're in trouble now the
other option is like okay if you destroy
it then what happens so we have the
option of like a Carrick arise because
the company is like well we haven't
heard from Bob in an hour we're gonna
send like someone else to do the Salvage
but maybe something happened to him
we're gonna send something bigger or you
basically warded off the Defenders and
you're now safe to salvage at your own
Leisure this kind of modular approach
will allow all the designers to come up
with whatever they want when it comes to
building missions there there could be a
number of possibilities it is only
limited by their imagination all of
these sort of modifiers and options are
there to sort of allow us to create
different types of gameplay or different
experiences with very little changing of
the logic it's a lot of just changing
different properties on a what's called
a mission record Another emission module
that we're working on that hasn't been
revealed yet is package extraction so
it's a mission where the nine tails have
taken over another Crusader platform and
they have gotten their hands on some
highly valuable Crusader prototype chip
components so Crusader really wants them
back before they fall into the wrong
hands and as a result they put out a
contract and many players all around
Crusader are tasked with going to that
platform and handing it to the ninth
Hills essentially getting back the
Prototype ship components before they
can be flown off world one thing we've
been playing with is that we hooked it
up to the Bounty modules that already
exist so we would fire a bouncy module
where the player goes to a location they
kill a ship and then we kick off a
salvage module All in One mission so the
player goes there kills the ship and
then instantly their objectives are like
and now Harvest it and then that's the
completion of the mission so at the
moment mining missions are on pause
while we wait for resources from other
teams but in the meantime we will
continue to develop Salvage missions
mining missions and the overall scope of
resource collection missions so you know
you could hopefully see your wildest
imagination of resource collecting
missions come true a reasonable
expectation of resource collection
missions in the future
so the biggest virtue of this is it
allows other designers like game from
Montreal or Sam from the EU locations
team to go in and be able to piece
together their own custom Mission we
just send them one submission module is
finished all the questions that they
need to fill in for this their designer
can go today fudge select a mission
modify a few properties that will change
the behavior of the mission whether it's
the type of box they're delivering or
what enemy they want you to kill all of
these modules are intended to be
stitched together in easy ways to be
able to create completely new bits of
content so that the content expansion
can be huge and this is really important
for when you try to build a game of the
skill of Star Citizen they could build a
mission where you go to a location to do
and eliminate all and as you're arriving
there there's a bounty Target in the sky
you have to take out first as you go in
and manage to kill them all they use the
item dispenser we use in jump town and
Korea to spawn an item that when the
player picks it up it then starts a
delivery mission that's the real win of
thinking modularly
so that was a little look behind the
scenes of what we do in the mission
feature team the mission for each team
consists of more than just the people
you see here we have a much bigger team
that are building these behind the
scenes to be able to bring you this new
content these new functionalities and
also help our designers internally to be
able to also deliver the same thing this
is only a fraction of things we have
worked on and are working on obviously
as more systems come online we are going
to start making more and more modules
Salvage and Mining were the most recent
ones and we've worked on those
um crafting is coming soon so we're
gonna probably make some modules with
that and we're going to continue to make
more and more Mission modules and more
things for you to play and enjoy thank
you very much for letting us tell you uh
what we do we're uh
hopefully making everything you like and
uh
yeah
I don't know what else
thanks very much for watching and I'll
see you in the next episode of inside
star citizenship
I'm not in the next episode you said you
were
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that modularity is what allows
for the work of One mission to be
carried over and utilized in a variety
of others then it allows for the
relatively quick construction and
iteration of missions by designers from
all over the globe that it is ultimately
what is allowing us to currently add
gameplay quickly and efficiently to new
locations like the underground
facilities building interiors and even
the upcoming pyro system and that new
modules are being created along the way
like the Salvage and Mining Parts a
resource collection as well as the
investigations we've discussed
previously
and just to touch on Alpha 318 once more
the team continues to tackle the
troubles that have plagued launched
since Friday and you'll find continuing
updates as needed at the robertspace
industries.com website now stability has
been steadily returning all week with
more and more people being able to
connect in and stay in for longer
durations after that and there's been a
number of absolutely critical fixes that
only became known and necessary thanks
to you all showing up and stressing the
ever-loving hell out of the new entity
streaming foundation for the persistent
Universe in ways that frankly we never
could on the PTU so thank you thank you
thank you and thank you to all the
developers who never appear on camera
because frankly they're just too busy
been a frustrating week for everybody
but I'm also really proud to stand here
and represent those who are working so
hard to do right by the community and
this project for inside Star Citizen I'm
Jared Huckabee thank you for watching
keep an eye on the website for all those
Alpha 318 post lunch details and we'll
see you all here next week
the last time I was in front of a camera
it seemed like really artificial and it
was difficult to talk to the camera it
felt like it was just judging me whereas
with you guys I feel like I'm more
having a conversation do you know where
Mission logic comes from no well the
earliest record of logic that we have in
our world started with Aristotle right
he wrote this book that we translate
nowadays as the instrument and he was
preoccupied with stuff like um
Socrates is Mortal all humans are mortal
therefore
wait did I mess that up
I said Socrates is Mortal no that's it
you had one chance
