## Transcript

Hey everybody, welcome to another
episode of Calling All Devs, our
question and answer series where we take
questions from you, the Star Citizens
themselves, and pose them directly to
our developers over video conferencing.
On this week's show, we are tackling
some of the most voted up and requested
topics from the community. We are
talking core tech. We're going to be
talking iCache, we're going to be
talking global persistence, and then
we're going to be talking about server
meshing in the end. So, to get us
started, we are here with
Chad McKinney. Chad, how you doing, man?
Doing great. Thanks for having me. Thank
you for being on the show.
Now, we are we are coming to you for
this because you are you are part of a
team of folks who work across the
studios across the world who are all
heavily invested in this core tech that
that will allow us to expand Star
Citizen to the size and the scope that
we that we all want it to be. Um so,
basically, let's just start the
conversation.
Talk to us about iCache.
Yeah, iCache is effectively kind of
shorthand for a collection of services
that are interfacing with the game
servers and back-end databases to allow
us to both write out and query data
efficiently and in a fault-tolerant way.
So, this is really important because
right now, the way the the servers are
working, they're using an in-memory kind
of database for this for this global
data.
Ultimately, that's not feasible. We if
we need to build it out so that things
can work in a mesh. In order for that to
happen, we need to actually write this
out into a place that all the servers
can look at it and agree on what the
state of the world is. So, the iCache is
our solution to make that access
scalable. And right now, the iCache
infrastructure on the back end is
actually largely done, and it's it's um
now at the point where game side, we're
hooking up our game code in order to
correctly write out the data uh
efficiently, query the data efficiently,
as well as fix up some of the game code
systems that had previously maybe had
some assumptions that don't work
correctly within the new context. Uh so,
that's kind of where we're at at the
moment. Effectively, what we're trying
to do is cache certain amounts of
certain data that we know that we need.
And this prevents us from hitting the
database, which is a more expensive
access. So, and by caching it, we're
optimizing our access. And we're also
able to build in a certain amount of
fault tolerance in the system through
various techniques like duplication and
regeneration. So, this gives us fast
access for the information that we need
when we need it.
Um and then, at the same time
on the game side, okay, I just lost my
train of thought. I'm sorry.
Take two. So, so yeah, it's effectively,
like like you mentioned, like the
difference between
having a hard disk where the data is
stored for long-term storage, that's
like more permanent, and your RAM that
it kind of effectively gives you faster
access that you're happier to write to,
but you know that it's temporary. So,
the iCache storage is storage that's not
meant to actually capture and define the
state of the world, but rather is an
intermediary between the final state of
the world, which is the actual database.
So, it's a yeah, that that's a good
analogy. Uh so, you did say earlier that
we're pretty much finished. I want to
get a little more little more clarity on
that. That that's that doesn't mean
uh what does finished finished mean?
Sure. So, I think to
to clarify here, what I'm talking about
is that the particular services that
compose the the infrastructure on the
back end for the iCache
framework is largely written. So, the
back-end engineers have written it,
they've tested it, um the APIs have all
been negotiated. So, we we have to
define not only the how the service
works, but also like how it communicates
with the game server. We've done all
that work. We've built out the structure
of the data, how the database is laid
out, all that's done. And so, now it's
taking this this system that we have and
actually connecting it to the game
itself.
Yeah, and to be clear, like we have
known for a long time that we're going
in this direction. So, on the game code
side the changes that are happening
right now aren't normally transformative
or or refactors or anything like this.
They're smaller sets of changes just
just to make sure that we have followed
all the best practices
Awesome. all over the place and that
things are persisting correctly and that
the the querying mechanisms that we're
using use the new API. So, there is some
small changes as far as like the API
that you use to query data. There's some
new concepts that we've introduced
specifically to help leverage um uh in
order that and specifically to allow us
to support things like physicalized
inventory and the new kind of cargo
changes that we're going to support that
are also going to be working with
physicalized inventory. So, we we have
been going in this direction, but we
need to do some final work on the game
code in order to make it operate
correctly, but also we need to make the
fundamental querying mechanisms and
physicalized inventory infrastructure on
the game side to support the game
systems on top of them. So, it sounds
like because we've known we were working
towards this, we've we've we've already
worked on a lot of precursors. We've
already
uh uh put our proverbial ducks in a row.
Yeah, we've we've been heading in this
direction for actually years. So,
whenever we started on client-side
streaming, we know at that point,
actually before that that we would be
ending up here, and then the ultimate
destination is spoiler alert later,
server meshing. So, I think we've made
tremendous progress, and we've done some
rather transformative changes in some of
the game like underlying game engine
code that I think um is is amazing. So,
I I think that we've made a lot of
progress. I want to say that we're um
closer to the end than the beginning is
how I would put it. I think I think
that's fair and safe to say. I
appreciate that. Um and when iCache
comes online, I know it's I know it's a
a stepping stone towards these other
things we're going to talk about, but
what kind of immediate impact would it
have for the players? Like how how will
the players recognize
when iCache is in and working? What what
what How does their experience change?
Sure. So,
I would say that some of the the
most apparent changes that will come
about is that we're going to have both a
combination of better response on on
server and service queries for this kind
of persistent data as well as better
fault tolerance and and scalability.
What that will like directly manifest as
all the different times in the game
where you're end up interacting with
these databases, which is constantly.
It'll be things like when you spawn a
ship, whenever you change your your load
outs, or your helmet, or your armor,
whenever you change something about your
vehicles, whenever you purchase
something, whenever you deal with cargo.
There's all these places in the game
where you're interacting with the
persistent state of the game. And in all
those places
right now, we're struggling both with
scaling to support the number of players
that we want, especially whenever we
have like a big uh event or, you know,
new release, we're really pushing on the
current infrastructure that we have.
Um but on top of it, it'll make it more
fault-tolerant so that whenever
inevitably something goes wrong the game
just doesn't fall over. With the current
what we call a monolithic pCache that we
have, if that service goes down, that's
just it for all persistence queries for
the entire, not just server, but all the
servers. So, this is clearly, you know,
not the right place to be.
Um but this new set of services
addresses that by not, you know, putting
all your eggs in one basket, as it were,
and allowing for a multiplicity of
handlers to be able to react to any
request. So, iCache. iCache.
iCache. Okay. So, the next
step beyond iCache in these pillars is
is
it's kind of server meshing and global
persistence, but for the sake of this
conversation, we'll move one in front of
the other here. Let's Let's go to Let's
talk global persistence.
Once we have iCache, how does that take
us to global persistence? Right. So,
global persistence is something that is
supported now that we have this iCache
framework. What it means is that we're
going to start writing out data about
the state of the world that does not
include player account data. Previously,
we would only store data that was
relevant to a particular player's
account, things like their ships, their
weapons, their item port attachments.
Perhaps you stole something from
somebody, we'll store that. But that's
where it stops. We want to do more
though. The game that we envision is
this incredibly high-fidelity,
high-persistent world where your actions
matter, you have an impact on the world.
Well, the only way to make that work is
is to actually store out the state of
those changes and to store out the state
of the world itself. So, that's what I
I've been calling global persistence.
So,
the reason why you haven't done this to
date though is that the amount of data
that we're talking about is like a
magnitude or two more. It's It's much
much more data.
And if we tried to write that out with
the current system, it would just, you
know, cough over and die. It would not
go well. So, iCache gives us the
scalability to actually deal with that
kind of that scale of data.
Um but on top of that, it's a
requirement to support server meshing.
But before we get to server meshing, you
know, global persistence really is, in
my opinion, a feature in and of itself,
and it's part of the vision of of the
ultimate version of Star Citizen. So, to
me it was very important that we make
sure that we execute on this, that we're
finding all the places in the game that
we want to support this kind of
persistent state, and make sure that we
update all the game systems to work
accordingly. So, we actually have a
version of server or sorry, we actually
have a version of global persistence
right now. It's just not apparent to
players because when they log out of the
server and log back in, they'll go into
a different server instance often, and
they'll see something different. And if
the server that they're on is crashes
and recovers, the history that it had is
gone. So, we actually are maintaining
much of this data, but it's just not in
a way that
players will really ever tangibly see.
And where we're going is making it more
permanent and on top of that,
recoverable. And so that as you get into
the game, we're going to be able to
expand out using server meshing, the
number of players within effectively an
instance or network we'll start calling
a shard. And as that expands, you'll be
playing more and more in effectively the
same kind of world line or or set of
history.
And your experience will be that you
will see you and your play groups,
you know, your effects on the world
become more permanent. And the idea is
that for all of the players in the game,
they end up seeing a version of the game
that
is effectively permanent for them. It is
from the time they start playing the
game to the time that they end,
everything is there, right? And to be
clear though, there are going to be sets
of gameplay around, you know, maybe
dynamic events in the game that happen,
or there will be places in the game
where maybe there's more maintenance
that will recover some of the the the
broken and messiness that accrues from
all this player behavior.
Uh you can imagine that if you have
maybe a military base or or maybe a high
traffic like high high cost neighborhood
in like area 18 or something like that,
they're going to have more facilities in
place to maintain it, to keep it clean
and fixed up. Whereas maybe a seedier
location perhaps in pirate space is
going to
you know, all the mess that's left
around is going to stick around for a
while. At that point, we need to talk to
Clive. We need to get the skinny on
server meshing. So, Chad, I'm going to
let you go. Thank you so much for taking
the time to be here on the show. You're
always a a pleasure to have on.
Thank you for having me. All right, take
care, man.
All right. So, uh costume change. It's
the next day, and my next call is for as
promised, Clive Johnson. Clive, how you
doing, man?
Hey Jared, I'm good. How are you? I'm
doing well. Thank you for taking the
call. Uh we are talking core tech
updates for Star Citizen. Uh we just got
done talking to Chad McKinney about uh
service streaming and iCache and global
persistence.
Uh and we are now coming to you for a
little talk about uh something we like
to call server meshing. So, um because
every show is somebody's first show, and
there might be folks who've joined the
project who don't know what it is what
we're talking about. Um let's just start
by introducing
uh the idea of server meshing, what it
is, and why we're pursuing it. And then
we'll go for an update after that.
Okay, well, currently um
um
players play the game, they connect to a
server, and it's a single server
uh holding up to 50 clients
running the entire simulation on that
one server.
Um
that's
um going to be a a a
severe limitation um
because obviously there's a finite
amount of processing available on my
computer.
Uh so, there's a finite number of
clients that it can support. Mhm. So, as
we want to expand the
um
the number of concurrent users, the
number of active users in the same
simulation at the same time, we need to
split that simulation off over multiple
servers.
So, the original idea is to have um
multiple servers running different parts
of the simulation. So, you might have a
server running
uh
the game at Port Olisar, you might have
a different server running the game at
say, Levski.
And that's great, and they're completely
independent.
But the problem then becomes how you get
from Port Olisar to Levski or back again
if
the um simulations are running on
different servers. So, we need to
connect the servers together. And what
that basically means is we'll have all
these servers running different parts of
the simulation, and they will
um selectively choose which other
servers to connect to, so that the
players can transition back and forth,
or that they can share parts of the
simulations together.
Um
and then they'll drop that connection
when it's no longer needed, and they can
make new connections with other servers.
All right. So, now that we've uh
now that we've we've reiterated for
some, we've introduced others to the
idea of server meshing, uh where are we
at right now in the process? I know I
know we've got teams working on iCache,
and uh global persistence is on the way,
and both of those are absolutely
necessary and crucial to server meshing
as we talked with Chad McKinney. But
uh your team's not sitting there just
waiting for them to finish their work.
You guys are You guys are in progress
now. Uh tell us tell us what you're
working on now.
Uh well, right now um we're working on a
couple of things. We're working on um
getting the time synchronization uh
correct, which
probably doesn't sound very server
meshing related.
But we've been aware for a while um that
there's been
um lag
um rubber banding and kind of desync
issues present in the main game um
obviously with all these servers
connected to each other in the server
mesh, that's going to make the problem
worse. That's the thinking, so we kind
of need to address it a bit now. Um we
can't promise that we're going to
completely solve it first go, but we're
we're investigating the situation.
Uh and trying to make as many
improvements as we can. And a lot of the
issues seem to come back to
time synchronization between
um
the clients and the server. And in
server meshing, just to remind everyone,
servers will be connected to each other,
so one server will be acting as a client
of another and receiving updates from
it. So,
they could too experience um rubber
banding and desync and so on. So, we're
going to try and make sure that clock
synchronization is right.
Um so, it's it's not just about getting
the um
the clocks actually in sync. It's
more fundamental than that. Some of the
problems we found are changing
how the engine actually handles the
concept of time, which sounds quite
grand, maybe. But yeah, it's it's
basically it's just fixing a load of
bugs that have crept in over the years.
It's uh it's quite tricky, and it's
quite
um detailed work, but yeah, we're
getting through it. We're getting seeing
some good results now.
Hopefully
that will be done soon. And then yeah,
we're also looking at
getting two servers talking to each
other, which may surprise some people
that that's not the first thing that we
did.
But
it kind of was cuz you know, obviously
the first thing you try when you're
trying to build server meshing is you
just
try and connect two servers together,
and you see what happens. And we weren't
really expecting it to work, and we
weren't too surprised when they didn't.
But it was quite a useful exercise, and
it showed
kind of what didn't work. Um
and what we would have to change to make
it work. So, we kind of built those
tests out, and people are working
through them right now. Uh and we're
getting pretty close to where we can
give it another go and have a a
reasonable shot at
um
the two servers actually being able to
communicate. So, the the the fundamental
problem there is that
the engine's based on the assumption
that
um a server thinks it owns the game
session, which with server meshing
obviously they're sharing the game
session between them. So, we've got to
make
one server set up, and it kind of has
the game session, and then another
server wants to join it, and it goes,
"Okay, yeah, you can share into it. You
you you now have as much authority and
ownership of this game session as I do."
It's a bit of a shift for
how the game code and the the network
code thinks about um game sessions and
how everything relates to each other.
So, throughout the game code, well,
throughout the engine, there's plenty of
checks going, "If this is a server, do
something like this. If it's a client,
do something like this." Um
which doesn't fit with kind of the
server meshing model where you've got
an authoritative server, you've got a
non-authoritative server, and you've got
regular game clients. So, all these kind
of if statements
were based on the assumption that you
could only ever have one authoritative
server. So, they all needed to change.
We're talking like thousands of
locations in the code.
So, we kind of did an audit. Um we split
that up into hundreds of tasks uh for
people to look at. That got spread out
across
basically every team has an engineer in
it.
And they've been working through it. Um
nearly at the end. There's a few
stragglers left to do, but we're nearly
done now with the change. It was this
new
Excuse me.
This new API that basically says, "Am I
the machine that has authority over this
entity? If I am, I can do it this way.
If not, I'm supposed to do this
instead."
Um so, that was a massive change, and
that in itself is getting
put out into the new builds, and you
can't see any changes. And that's a good
thing because it shows that we're not
breaking stuff by making these changes.
So, it's it's an early test.
Um
I I think we're doing okay. So, the the
idea was um to try and get as many of
the
the kind of um the tasks
as much of the work done early where it
might have a knock-on to other teams, so
like changing how
other people write code to decide
whether something should be handled
authoritatively or not.
Um how they might handle time, any any
of those kind of changes we want to do
as early as possible. So from this point
on, people are writing code the correct
way and we've got less to go back and
kind of revisit. Got you. Um and because
there's such a a huge amount of code
that's already been written,
we're kind of expecting it to take a
while for those changes to get um
to get worked through.
So while that's going on,
we the network team are kind of working
on getting the servers connecting to
each other.
Um also done some other changes to it
like headless clients and all things
good to try and allow
um them to be used for automated
testing. So that when we get these
server meshes up and running, we can
automatically test them rather than have
to UI try and sort these things out. Um
yeah, so there's there's a lot of
different tracks all kind of progressing
in parallel. Um
and we're we're making progress.
It's not easy.
It's a lot to cover.
I think overall, it sounds like between
the conversations with you and and Chad
that we're making some pretty good
progress. Uh we're generally happy with
where we're at.
Um
yeah, anything else you want to add
before I let you go?
Um no, I don't think so. Um
have I forgotten something? No. No,
that's all good.
All right, well that about does it for
this episode of Calling All Devs. I want
to give a very special thanks to Chad
McKinney and to Clive Johnson for for
stepping outside their comfort zones a
little bit and and speaking with us very
candidly about the progress of their
work. It's it's not always the easiest
thing to do.
Uh but we always appreciate it when they
can.
Um and then just one more word about
iCache, server meshing, global
persistence, all those things. Those are
major signposts in the road of Star
Citizen's development, but the work does
not end there.
Uh while we're feeling very good about
our progress and as I think Chad
probably put it best, we're closer to
the end than we were to the beginning.
Uh we will we look forward to continuing
to update you on the progress of not the
just these features, but all the
features of Star Citizen.
Uh these ones and the ones beyond. So
for Calling All Devs, I'm Jared Huckaby.
Until next time.
