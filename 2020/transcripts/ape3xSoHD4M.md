## Transcript

hey everybody welcome to another episode
of calling all devs our question and
answer series where we take questions
from you the star citizen community
impose
them directly to our developers on this
month's show we are talking
ship we have collected a series of ship
related
ship feature related questions and we're
going to post them to our
vehicle director director of vehicles mr
john crew john how you doing
hey i'm good thanks how are you are we
all right let's jump right into this
because we got we
we we got questions we got time uh our
first question
uh we've seen on isc recently that work
has begun
on ship to ship docking ship to station
docking
can you give us an update on both
yep i sure can um we sort of think of
them in three different ways
although the two are sort of under the
same umbrella of ship to ship docking so
with shipship docking uh there's two
aspects we're
looking at so there's the direct heart
attachment which the prime example is
the constellation of merlin
and then there's ship to ship docking as
a journal which is just any ship with a
docking port connecting to another one
so first up we're doing the connie and
merlin uh hard
docking uh that is well underway we've
got to the point where the vehicle
is attached to each other and you can
get in and out and we're now
at the point of just sort of dealing
with all the quirks of
having two vehicles physically joined
together
intentionally uh which has thrown up
some weird physics problems that we're
just working through
how does that how does that docking work
did does the pilot have to
pilot it in is there some kind of ar
thing they've got to follow
completely automatic pilot it's it's not
completely automatic so
you you communicate to the the target
ship and they
accept your request to dock because if
there if there was no sort of permission
system you could have anybody
just randomly trying to dock with you
but once that's all sorted out you get a
docking ui
which gives you an idea of how far off
on each axis and role
you are you line up all the symbols
you're in the right place and then
the very last few meters it takes over
and automatically
guides you in so you have to do sort of
99 of the flying into it and that's the
very last bit where
we have to ensure that you are
orientated a very specific way to get
like you think about the merlin there is
a baked animation sequence to get out
the ship so if you are
five centimeters off to the left you
could end up getting out
through the constellation out the other
side so we have to ensure you're a very
specific position so that's why there's
automatic there
okay um i'll come back to the bit of
shift ship talking uh shift station
docking is also
well underway we've got a fairly
functional prototype at this point
uh we're just working out some of the
last technical hurdles for that before
we
enter full production on that so that's
you taking your large ships and docking
at any of the
orbital stations or other places that
have these large extended docking tubes
that i think you saw in ifc
um so that's that's the order of battle
there really we're doing the
constellation merlin docking first then
we're doing ship to station docking and
then at some point after that we'll do
the ship to ship
um purely because there's there's less
of a need for that right now
um the constellation merlin thing solves
some tech problems for ship to station
docking
ship to station docking is needed for
ships that are coming
uh ship to ship is a sort of nice to
have that we will do but it's not
as important as those other two yeah all
right
um let's move on to the next question
then uh
a lot of people asking about the current
status of
physicalized things like physicalized
armor um
armor penetration of course uh and then
updated sdf shield so
the the the tech features that surround
vehicles
uh what can you tell us yep all those
three things are in active production at
the moment
um they're not just for vehicles uh
especially the the physicalized armor
and penetration that's also
going to be applicable to actors and the
fps game
so again we've got to a point where
we're working on the
the initial parameters and tuning them
in making sure that
they're working as we expect um before
we start
really putting all hands on it chris has
been involved in it a lot of physics
guys are doing the
work the vehicle and the actor teams are
working together to go right
we need all these parameters
please please make them the the physics
guys give us a
build back and go sure that that sort of
works this bit doesn't work when you're
small tuning here so
we're definitely working on it right now
um how far through that process
we are i i it's hard to say until we get
something
that works across the system um
so it sounds like you're you're working
on the the prototype the tech itself
as opposed to actively converting all
the other ships
you know yeah okay we have our internal
like milestones for this so it would be
foolish to
work on the tech alongside converting
all the ships to it because there's just
so many ships
so we want to get a very small set of
ships working first with it all get them
all playing nicely against each other
understand the tools we have to balance
this now because it moves away
completely from weapon does 100 damage
ship has a thousand health
right 10 shots equals death um whilst we
have a lot of that all on paper
paper doesn't necessarily translate to
fun game play
once it's all implemented so yeah all
the other teams are working on the
physicalized armor and the armor
penetration
so penetration will be a thing over
penetration will be a thing
um sdf shields was the last thing there
i think
so in recent builds
all ships have uh sdfs generated for
their
what will be their shield bubbles uh the
build process is now
splitting them out for us um you will
have seen the
atmospheric reentry effect in 310 uses
that
as the basis so 310 was a sort of
precursor for
rolling it out on a a slightly simpler
problem
to solve which is atmospheric entry
effects sort of
reacting to whatever angle your ship is
right shields takes that to the next
level so
cortec wise it's pretty much there
and it's really now working with the vfx
team and
the vfx engineering team to to make the
shields look
good because we can't use any of the
existing shield effects
work we have to recreate that from
scratch and that that brings up a lot of
uh not tech but sort of visual gameplay
how do we make it look good at
short range and far range without
blinding players
and then of course after you make it
look good then making it performative
like it's finding that balance between
you know you can make it look
amazing and like if you only had one
ship to blow up you were fine
but in when it comes to giant melees
of multiple ships you need something
that can scale you know
scale and be performative and stuff so a
lot of work to be done there i would
imagine
yeah certainly the the initial stuff
we've seen of the sdf shields internally
looks
very promising in terms of just how it
looks and how it behaves
because one of the big things is when
you lose a wing the sdf adapts to
losing that you don't have this weird
bubble floating out so it's going to be
a really nice change
and we will of course be showing that to
the community it's just as soon as we
get
closer to the more performative model
it's one of those things where
we you show it now and it could lead to
inappropriate expectations about what's
going to actually be there so
um all right so that's exciting though
the physicize armor
armor penetration sdf stuff all in
active development now
uh it's pretty cool um
at times throughout star citizen
development we've heard about
how each ship manufacturer would have
its own hud
um there would be an aegis hud or an
anvil hud or something like that
um we have we used to have some version
of that and they kind of went away for
an homogenization uh
is that coming back yep that's coming
back uh in fact we're
we're actively working i keep saying
actively working but it's true
um it's it's true uh the
the aegis ships or specifically the
gladius for
squadron reasons is going to be getting
a completely fresh
hud overall and then we have
i think we've also worked on an rsi
styling
so all the manufacturers will be getting
thematically heat themed
huds for their ships rather than just
being the same hud
recoloured and that will apply to the
mfds as well so
the core functionality of the mfds when
they're reworked will be the same
but they'll just have a visual styling
over it to make it feel like this is a
drake mfd versus an aegis mft
and this i guess i would imagine this is
part of why uh the
ship had has been being converted into
building blocks
in recent patches people have seen
aspects of it
being converted over and it looks like
what they had before
but it's being converted so that they
can be modular so that we can plug them
into the rsi style the aegis style the
you know every other manufacturer's
style yeah pretty much
it's it's uh it looks exactly the same
as it did but it is in fact all new
uh and now we have the ability to say
style it by just applying one style
sheet much like uh
web css you can change the theme with a
very simple change
which you can't do with flash you just
have to remake the entire asset
and then you've got two things to update
every time you want to add or change
something
uh so this new uh aegis uh style is it
going to be
different than we've seen it's going to
be very different to what's in game and
what people have seen
cool well we'll we'll we'll we'll uh
hang tight until we can
show folks what it looks like um
another big popular question when it
comes to vehicles or vehicle tech that
folks have been waiting for
the ability to spawn smaller vehicles
inside larger vehicles uh whether that's
the
whether that's the pisces inside the
carrick or the
or a rover ursa rover inside a
constellation
uh any we've been on a good tr trail so
far all these things in active
development
is this an active development uh it's
it's sort of semi-active we did some
internal tests
uh we we got a we got it working um
it's important to differentiate some of
those things from
like connie and merlin docking that's
that's almost like an entirely different
thing
right um anything that
is always going to be in a repeatable
position every time you spawn the ship
or customize the ship like the murder
and the connie
uh will work um things where you can
change it out
between multiple ships uh we're looking
at this it ultimately it still creates
item ports that ships are attached to
but it does them dynamically
um and for various technical reasons
we're sort of waiting for
eye cash to be more complete on this
certain area
certain other areas and then we'll pick
that up because if we try and chew on it
in now it'll just be
throwaway code that icash does out the
box for it
that makes sense that makes sense we
we've run into that situation in a
number of features
so so all right so that one's not in
active development like the other things
just waiting on other dependencies yes
all right so lastly our last ship
feature-related question has to do with
the hull c uh we know that work was
paused on it some time ago because it
was rated
uh waiting for other ship related tech
like the expandable collapsible physics
grids i look at the ship to station
docking and i
i see similarities there uh are we
getting closer to
making this thing a reality uh we are
um like say the ship station docking uh
required uh animatable and multiple
physics grids which is what the whole
seed
requires uh so we now have those uh so
that's one thing
ticked off the list of whole sea
dependencies uh we still have a few more
that we need to solve before we can
release the ship but we are
uh able to actually progress internally
now a bit more with it
um so we need the ability for rooms to
scale like uh physics areas because
now you can have gravity in that central
spine but there'll be no air
so it's sort of equally as problematic
for release
okay um and that also help all the level
designers and the vehicle designers
because
we want to unify the way all the rooms
and shapes are made in the engine
um at the moment they're all sort of
individual shapes so
a design has to go in and mark up a room
for the air an audio designer has to go
in a marketplace room for
the audio volume uh i have to go in and
mark up a room for
vis areas and portals to stop light
coming in so you want to all put them
into one single
feature that can support scaling and
then bam
that's the whole c part solved
um the two other bits needed are
awaiting nicely triggered state machines
on vehicles so
we sort of fudge it together at the
moment by tying state changes into the
landing gear
deployments uh we need to split that out
that's scheduled for
one of the vehicle teams um and then the
last one is really the cargo system it
obviously carries thousands of units of
cargo and we only supply cargo in one se
boxes at the moment
and that system needs to support not
doing that
it needs to go right you've bought 4 000
units of uh
laronite and here's
100 big boxes of it or
um because it will just server
performance
we've seen what happens when people go
wild with picos this would be
a whole lot of a lot worse than that
and it's one of those things where the
upcoming cargo decks in 311
uh while not the functionality it's in
311 but the cargo decks themselves are a
platform for additional
features and those will tie into uh
being able to offload
uh things like the hull c and maybe even
load them up to begin with
yeah they're the perfectly designed
places for that because you don't want
to take your whole sea
well you can't land with the cargo out
so there's very little point taking it
down to the surface to land but
you will need to drop these off at
orbital stations right so
a lot of good progress being made uh
it's exciting to hear
uh it's exciting to hear about things
like the physicalized armor and the
armor penetration and the sdf shields
and the
two different versions of ship docking
you all in active
development you know some we hear so
often about
you know dependencies and this has to
wait for this but to know that these
things are actually in active motion now
uh the the the hud styling for aegis
another big thing uh it's another big
part of
making these ships feel different and
unique and bespoke
um lots of exciting stuff um
we we blazed through this we got a
little time left in what we're allowed
so i'm i'm gonna veer a little bit
point one on my own in there it's not a
ship feature related thing but it's a
ship thing
my dad when he when when he pledged
for star citizen the first ship that
brought him in
was the was was the redeemer i mean that
was
that was that was his first pledge uh it
brought him into star citizen
um we've talked about how it was going
to be reconcepted
re-envisioned you know for for a couple
reasons
it's been quiet has there been any
movement on this
yeah so we we talked about this a while
back about moving it into a sort of a
full gunship role
and that that has happened we had a
little hollow viewer of it at the
fleet week invictus launch week event so
if you uh eagle-eyed you will have
spotted the redeemer was there in the
hollywood and
it wasn't quite looking the same as
it does in the hangars or it does in the
original concept
so we have done some work on it and
um i can maybe share a few pictures of
it before this gets
okay so yeah a gunship
needs lots of guns so um
i can't quite remember off the top of my
head the the sizings off these
um but the
the exterior of the redeemer has pretty
much been entirely reworked
but keeping it in the same style as it
was
we were on the fence about do we just
move it to a different manufacturer
because it looks so different to aegis
but in the end we decide to keep it
aegis we'll keep the cracker wings
but we'll just do a little massaging of
all the shapes here to bring it more
into the
aegis style so the nose has changed the
turret design has changed the tail has
changed
it's not quite as rounded as it was
uh there's some some harsher aegis lines
in there uh
still got the wheels on the bottom we
toyed around with skids but
we'll keep it to the original concept
you can see here there's
there's a lot more aegis right right
trying to do my best paul jones
impersonation um i think the tales
slightly changed as well
um so it has a manned turret on the top
manta on the bottom
that are entirely accessible from within
the ship you don't need to go on a
little
ghost training ride out into outer space
to get to the turrets anymore
um still has the ramp on the back uh
and so not a drastic reinvision no no
it's still the redeemer that people you
would still look at and go this is the
redeemer it's not a
complete reimagining of it we try to
keep it faithful to the original
concept but just bring it up to modern
standards
i don't have any of the interiors here
to show but that is that's had much more
of a
upgrade from uh what was there uh
there's the drop seats are gone they've
been replaced with
space to sort of walk around the ship
if people have gotten to the one in the
hangar still they'll know it's it's
quite compact to move around in there
so we've uh enlargened it
got access to components you've got
access to all the turrets you can
freely move around without it being
cavernous
but yeah you can see there's a there's a
lot of turrets there's two at the front
one of those is pilot control
there's the manned one behind it there's
manual on top uh there's the one on the
tail as well
so yeah this is really designed for for
hovering around these nutcrackers will
rotate for vtol so you can really go
full ac 130 style and
engage in ground combat nice uh and
this is this is still the this is still
the concept mesh we're looking at this
this is
being actively built in engine right now
this isn't being actively worked on by
the vehicle team right now this is the
the pre-production uh concept for us
just like any other ship um we we
for ones that have been previously
available and are going to go back into
production we we treat them as a new
ship we take them through the entire
concept pipeline
um to just vet that everything is there
there needs to be there before
artists put pen to paper okay
well that's that's enough of your
surprise treats all right well
thank you so much john the redeemer
looks like it's in good hands
uh i think folks will be really happy to
have to see that it's uh
made some progress here of course when
it does go into active production
uh we will let the community know and
keep an eye on the public roadmap
for when you can expect it uh in any
live release
so john i'll let you go thank you so
much man thank you that's been good
all right that about does it for this
episode of calling all devs a special
thanks to john crew for taking time to
be here on the show with us for this
special talk and ship episode
remember you can submit your questions
for consideration on each episode up in
the thread
up on spectrum so for calling all debs
i'm jared huckaby
until next time take care
you
