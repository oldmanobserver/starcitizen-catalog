## Transcript

hi
everybody welcome to another episode of
star citizen live
ainu uh i'm your host uh jared huckabee
and if you've never seen star citizen
live before uh it's where we take about
an hour out of our day to uh
what oh am i not supposed to hold on
that's where we take an hour every day
at the end of the week
and chat about a topic related to the
development of star citizen
today we have members of our esteemed uh
various uh ai teams on the show
uh with us uh this week so let's just
jump
right into it and now that i've had my
fun
at their expense uh let's just go around
the room uh
do what we always do introduce ourselves
talk a little bit about what we do
who we are and all that jazz we will
start just we'll just go
clockwise we'll counterclockwise so this
way william
who are you what do you do for star
citizen
uh hello i'm will i'm an ai programmer
um specifically i work on ships along
with andrea
um yeah i recently have been working on
a
fair bit on the sort of pilot combat
like uh how
how fighters behave in combat and making
it
trying to vary it a little bit between
different
different personalities you know
different traits that kind of thing
that's the kind of thing i do know uh
and andrew hello
i'm a senior gameplay programmer i work
on the social ai team
but i'm not very social i'm quite shy
um and i'm currently working on
some stuff for squadron 42 to do with
um people eating and drinking in the
muscles so
got lots of uh social behaviors and
using
lots of machines like food dispensers
and getting the right knife and fork
which
we've got had a lot of discussion about
the way that we your perfect place
setting for sitting at a table but that
kind of stuff
and all of the ai behaviors to do with
that so that's what i'm working on
okay uh next up andrea who are you and
what do you do for star citizen
yeah i'm an ai programmer in the
francophone
tank force office and my work focus
mainly on ship ai
so i work with william most of the time
and
i've been working the recent time in
this year mostly on the
3d navigation aspects of sheep ai
and more in general the
awareness of the special environments or
even
properties of environment like gas
clouds
and also took care of quantum linking
with ai and players
uh yeah this kind of system basically
very cool so very important stuff
related to the the the ai ships of the
persistent universe
uh francesco who are you what do you do
for star citizen
i'm yeah i'm i'm the eye director i'm
francesco cucci
and i'm mostly working a bit with you
know all the guys here
i'm trying to make sure you know that
all the architecture all the systems fit
together
uh try to do some work myself you know
and i'm i'm not
busy with lots of meetings uh recently
i'm working on a bit of
functionalities to allow ai to open
doors that are closed
and you know where the front doors uh
being able to basically create any
complex logic out of uh environment
transitions
uh that is gonna be interesting and on
the future to see it i
bet and last but certainly not least dan
hey uh i'm dan i'm lead system designer
in the frankfurt office and uh
i deal with a lot of the system works
but in regards to the ai
i deal with uh the designs on uh
the fps combat ai team and more
specifically more recently
the combat uh for vanduul the combat
behaviors
so dan no stranger to uh star citizen
video programming
uh the rest of you welcome some of you
this is your first time on any of our
shows so
we'll we'll try to take it easy um start
you off with a
with a softball here uh chairs no um
so uh as usual
all right okay look at it uh for those
of you who are watching live
uh yes we are aware that currently uh
the website servers the
whatnot are are down at the launch of
iae um
everybody as as happens quite frequently
with
these major events um got very excited
all at the same time
we are here doing this show i don't have
any formal updates for you i don't have
any
information to give you other than what
you already have other than to say that
there are top people
who aren't doing a show right now who
are all working on that
and if we have any updates during the
course of the show we'll be sure to
provide them for you
with that the subject today is ai and
you
basically all the ways that ai is being
used currently in the persistent
universe
and maybe some of the things that we're
working towards in the future
if you're watching live you can submit
your questions in one of two ways
you can either put your questions in the
twitch chat uh
prefacing your question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets that's going to help our
community management team pull it out
from the chat
you can also do the same on spectrum
well
you could if spectrum was working
so we'll just stick to twitch chat
that's what happens what
habits man habits are hard to break uh
as usual we also collected questions
throughout the week
on spectrum where folks could submit
their questions and then vote them up
uh so as usual we're gonna start in on
some of those as some of the live ones
are curated and pulled in um all right
you said it let's just start with chairs
sounds good why wha what what what
happens why does this happen
so yeah i mean we had like funny enough
like this type of bug is like
visually always looks similar right so i
think since the beginning i think
really probably is one of the oldest
bike we have like i think it's like
maybe
four years ago started to you know i was
starting to have like
people standing in the chair and the box
that it was that time is completely
different from the bikes that we have
right now you know we started with
having
i think one of the first one i remember
was there was something to do with the
animation
that when the look pose was actually
kicking in and causing the body to turn
then it would go on uh basically full
body animation
would kick in and it would just detach
the thing from the chair or the
couch you know so there was one long
time ago and then i think for a while
we've been like quite in a good shape
and then you know
we started with optical tennis streaming
and this is where i think we are
starting to find
a more zinc issue in a sense so
basically for people who don't know
right this the chairs
in star citizen are pretty much usable
what we call usable
our usables are are pretty much just the
representation that the eye has of how
to interact with the world so like a
chair is pretty much just an object
where you can sit
and to achieve that what you do is like
there is one part that is on the eye
code that basically says oh there's
something where i can sit so
how do i need to arrive to start to play
the animation
to you know enter into the chair and
then i play my idol on top of the chair
then there is this coupling of these two
objects that is the character
and the share right and then what
happens is there's the streaming code
that can happen
at different times right so when you are
part of the chair right now you're also
part of the aggregate
of the environment so when the
environment streams out
ideally what should happen is that the
attached object should first stream out
that is like
usually the character then the
environment streams out and then when we
stream scene
the environment streams in and then the
character streams
in as well and he knows that it should
be attached to the to the chair
and then the kind of request gets
propagated to the
different components of the character
and then the component decides to
reattach it and put it in the right
state
right now we are like these components
we are fixing them some some of those
and we're fixing
of course one at a time you know when we
find the bag we fix it
uh so far we found that there were some
issues with the
uh with the fact that initially the
usable were detaching
the character before streaming out so at
that point it was like yeah we have lost
information you know i was like wait you
started you don't know anymore that was
one
uh then i think we had some the sync on
the
events that were coming from the
networking and we fixed that
uh then we fixed another bag
that basically was always related to the
order of synchronization so basically
what would happen was
that some characters could just try to
stream in
in longer time and what happens is in
the meantime
some other character that the streamed
in earlier it was not attached or usable
but still the usable from the characters
to stream in right
so in a sense some of those bags
won't really be so important in the
futures once we have the simulation and
once we have all the
the server mesh because it won't matter
that the ai is actually sitting there
right the simulation with the care of
saying you know what it should not
be sitting there on the chair or
actually the share should be reserved
for this guy and if the guy
is removed then it will just be cleared
right because the other issue that we
had is i
if we reserve that spot we can't
guarantee that actually the character
streams back in because there are
characters that might be dynamic right
so maybe the share then remains forever
reserved and then actually never comes
into play so we actually already added
like some code that basically handles
that
and now we basically found another bag
that is actually under you know
investigation and we are trying to solve
it basically that is like
um sometimes happens that the
character streams before the objecting
which is attached to so we are running
you know
we are basically handling this code a
bit better and we are trying to handle
the fact that you know some of this
order might be slightly different even
if you know if right now
uh where you know should not have really
happened that one
uh but it will also like keep the state
and the problem is this is this
ownership within this code right what we
want to have as well as achieving as
a developers is to try to have code that
is
that is owning that state right so that
you can tell it's like okay i should be
sitting there now if the chair is not
coming i know it's gonna come
so it doesn't matter if it comes in this
frame next frame or you know
in 10 frames or one second but i know
that this is my state and i should not
run other logic to do other things
and complete the sync this is basically
where we are at and of course
it's quite fun to see that he's always
the guy standing on the chair right it
looks like oh
it's like it's that's hard to fix that
and it's like yeah no but it's just like
a lot of things
happening at the same time that give the
same visual glitch
yeah it's it's actually an example of
something that happens quite often
in through a lot of systems in the pu
where
the same uh the same outward symptom can
be caused by a
number of underlying you know causes and
it can often look like no progress is
being made
in resolving the issue but it's like no
actually where there's a crazy game of
whack-a-mole going on underneath
that you don't see and you know i see
the change logs i see the reports
yes resolved resolves often it's like it
still happens it's like
and the thing is the good thing is the
progress is still happening so what i
mean is like
these systems are getting much more
stable it's just that you know
as a player of course sometimes you
might perceive there is no
change but actually there have been a
lot of changes and
it's one of those things how
how often you you spend a lot of time
working on something that happens
like it used to happen an awful lot and
now we're spending
more and more time on the just the very
small
occasions that it happens but because
they're so visible and so
recognizable it's always you know over
time those things
generally that is generally a good thing
that is the fact that it's so visible
and noticeable it makes us
find it uh absolutely because otherwise
if it was a hidden thing that only
happened in a corner you only notice is
once in a while then you would run with
a big system that is
might cause way more problems later yeah
no and and i think also i think this is
why we are not putting any
any kind of patch yet right because this
is i think
the good thing for us is that this helps
us stabilizing the underlying system
like some of those bugs are not even
necessary ai
per se related right it's just that we
are the kind of bottom of the chain so
if something goes wrong in the mean you
know
on the way then yeah the eye looks bad
so the short answer of that very long
answer is blame the chairs
of course always always explains and
actually again
blame the npc always so now that we've
had our fun let's get into let's get
into some more of the questions that
that folks have
been submitting here um how would you
consider the current state
of ground-based ai fps combat and what
is needed to make it more
a more challenging or rewarding
experience to players
dan do you understand yeah um i mean the
state right now
we're seeing a lot of difference
technically when you're looking at the
state of it when you play it
uh in single player versus when you play
multiplayer we're definitely seeing a
lot of
issues that come from uh dsyncs
and from uh sometimes server performance
or stability but besides that there's a
lot of things that we still have on our
plans from
design slash behavior perspective that
we want to do with the ai
the eye right now are fairly simplistic
they
run a few behaviors that they run in an
okay way they either push if they have a
shotgun
or they stay in their area and fight you
from that
area um we are now working on
on them kind of going and replenishing
ammo uh surrendering enough if they run
out obama completely and they can't find
a place to replenish their ammo stuff
right so we're adding the stuff
but there's so many other things that we
need to look into we need to look into
how we flank how we try to intercept and
kind of
head off the player how how we're gonna
throw grenades to make sure the player
doesn't
hunker down in the net in a single area
and tries to snipe everyone from there
uh how they're gonna react to grenades
getting thrown their way there's
there's like so many things left to do
here
uh we're just uh we're just beginning
let's put it this way from a design
perspective
um how does uh how does the work on the
new uh
the planetary navmesh play into any of
this
so i think definitely like that one is
uh it's gonna be like a critical part to
have like you know encounter on the
surfaces
right so i think right now uh i started
some work uh
on uh verifying like you know how much
we can generate and
navigation mesh can you know right now
basically can generate
on the planetary surface we can properly
handle
like you know the the basically the
planet mesh
uh on that side um basically
what is the plan the plan is to use the
navigation mesh
the basically features that we have but
expand it in a way which can work more
efficiently on the planet right so
planets are
in essence created by those patches
right that can just
leaves around the players and basically
we would probably use uh
uh an approach very similar for the mesh
so there would be like this kind of
dynamic
knob mesh what i call a piercing mesh
that's gonna be applied to planets and
basically the patch of this
mesh will only exist where we want to
have ai so it's going to be
much more efficient than having like you
know the the full generation
uh everywhere and then of course like
basically the
the eye will function in essence in the
same way as it will work somewhere else
the critical bit is how we connect does
that mesh and this is part of the work
we already
started i think last year uh that was
basically
the ability of connecting multiple num
meshes
so we have what we call navigation links
irrigation links are basically
a way to define some object that can
connect uh
kind of areas right so imagine if you
imagine the
uh ugf on some planets right
those will have like some parts that
have the entrance of the
the ground base and that one might just
have navigation links to the planetary
navigation
and those one can also link multiple
zones multiple physics grid
and allow basically the eye to
automatically transition
i think we in the last year demo when
the where
npc is entering a spaceship and flying
off
that was basically the first iteration
that we worked on for that
and you could tell basically the you
know the spaceship's land you know opens
the door the door dynamically links to
the navigation area that is uh you know
uh
physically placed on the object
container that is placed on the on the
planet
but then these two things dynamically
link when the door is open in that
environment so the eye can find a proper
path
can enter can transition between the
different grids and then you're going to
disconnect it and going away so this is
basically all these little pieces
are gonna be just going together to just
create this experience on the planet as
well
plus i think this is going to also be
beneficial for having you know creatures
on the planet
and all the all the different type of
you know life that we want to have there
this next question is kind of tip uh
topical at the moment uh has to do with
server performance
so here's a question for the programmers
here how much of the ai
that we see is affected by general
server performance
there is quite a bit maybe i think
andrea or will can also you know
talk up some example of the spaceships
but for example if you
look at the bartender right now let's
take one social example right
what sometimes happens is that he's is
reacting to you a bit slowly
right and that happens because like
really the performance of this effort
when he goes too much down
like you know it takes a bit of time for
him to find for example where you are
sitting and how to navigate to you
especially if there are like lots of you
know we have i think
some the worst case scenario is
something like 2 000 characters or 1
500 characters active at the same time
right and
uh one server and that is you know quite
a lot
for you know like basically what we do
is i do not go too much
heavy on the on the server we of course
distribute calculation over time but
that means that if you have some
much you know so many requests at the
same time it just takes
more time to receive the the results um
so of course that one is going to be for
that beneficial like the server mesh
some other stuff i think what we see
also is the the time of reaction i think
in fps combat that then just mentioned
right if you
if like let's say let's mention how we
handle vision
vision is true you know it's physical
vision so it's like you can really tell
if a character
seeing in that type of environment like
the other player right but even that one
is a distributed calculation so you you
have a sort of cached
uh information that you persist you know
that you that persistence said your
perception system
and he updates every time he can and if
the
player just pops out you know and it's
not updating in that case of course it's
not that
that fast we introduce some stuff like
for example having some sort of
priorities for people next to the place
and stuff like this but when the you
know when the server is really
is really heavy have you used you know
there's too much usage there
then of course it's like not that easy
to make it snappy as it would be in a
single player you know the single-player
experience
um yeah i mean this is the same for
shipshape
ai i mean uh i mean
imagine combat uh dogfight when
the and the player very
very close to each other the ai needs to
continuously
update its its aiming position it's
a trajectory because it changes
continuously right
and he wants to maybe orbit around
around the the target that can be the
player or another ai
uh if if the update is slow then
every every new update the position of
the the relative position of
ships will be really different so the
you will notice some
maybe the target the the look direction
or the gun direction is saying
is you will see that it's really off but
it should not be
and for example william did some work on
the accuracy for ship ai for pilots and
i mean for them and the accuracy
basically something that
basically simulates the the skill the
the amy skill
of the pilot of the gunner that updates
in time so
the longer you are aiming at your target
the better you
you are and you have a higher chance to
tweet
and if the frame rate is too slow this
will never happen basically
you know so the aiming will be always
off a little bit behind orbit i mean i
had maybe depending on
the strategy
it's not based on the frame rate
obviously it's based on
uh well yeah it's not based on like per
tips you add this much but it's like
it's always the tick it's really based
on the time but yeah it's still like
it's still like if you if you have one
update at the per second right the
player does so much because the play is
not updating i want one
one time per second right so the player
on his client is super snappy and he's
like oh i seen him he there and now he's
like he's over there he's like
now he's over there it's like it's just
really hard like for
for the eye to even you know i don't
know just find a great solution when the
when the performance
are very low of course when the
performance are medium then it's a
different
thing we also have like a lodi's update
on the behaviors
you know when our things are a bit far
you know we update less when things are
closer we update more often
you know we are interested of course
like not everything is implemented yet
but you know we want to you know have
better
weight into what is the action you know
what is the important thing that we need
to update as well
um how does that affect the way that you
program it's it's do do you program this
stuff
for an ideal situation that
maybe sometimes isn't always there or do
you have to
adjust uh your workflow based on
the current state of things it's a bit
of a
bit of both right so i think there are
things that you need to do in the best
the edl case like combat needs to be the
ideal thing in the sense that you want
to have it the snappy decision
you know you can't of course even in
combat you have
different approaches for example if
you're going to cover right cover is a
state where you can
uh you can survive there right it's like
i'm just in cover i can make my
calculation a bit slower while i'm
actually doing some short-term decisions
that maybe it's not based on whatever
uh requires like high performance and
it's the same with social right with
social is like if i have a guy said
standing on the chair sitting on the
chair uh
basically you you can assume that there
is a state that can persist and make
sense
right so if that one makes sense then
you can take the time that you have like
eventually you have a guy reading a book
if if he stands five seconds in five
seconds in ten seconds it's not really
important right that the its state
can communicate what he's trying to do
no matter what and basically the idea of
writing behaviors is a lot about this is
about
it's a lot about you might stream in any
usable
right you might start in any usable as a
starting point
uh and then you might need to decide
what is the best thing you can do
and the best thing you do first can take
a long time to you know or
like enough time basically uh to be
decided
and also you might not never you might
never find the optimal thing you want to
do right you need always reactively i
could do
everything right you could you maybe you
are a changer you want to take the
bronze stick
and then the play arrives still and then
i say okay what what do you do
so you need always to build your
behavior in a way to handle situation of
course
um but i think a lot sometimes it's also
just bikes that we have
due to the you know server performance
that we see
i would say as well sorry uh that
the question is how much of the the
performance of the ai
is based around the server performance
but also the server performance is also
based around
how well the ai the ai calculation the
performance
the zebra performances um is
affect the the code of the ai
to determine the server performance so
we want things that
which are gonna not slow down the whole
server because
the ai lots of ai are processing the
same thing so for example with the
usable calculations
trying to cache as much information as
possible
so that if you have thousands and
thousands of characters
they're not going to be slowing down the
rest of the server performance
right and everyone else's experience
just because they're calculating
something which might be very cosmetic
for example
so it's about not what the server can do
for you but
what you can do for this uh
yeah it's also i think this this is
distributed across all the departments
right it's not just the eye but it's
like
it affects everything even the ipcs
cannot
absolutely absolutely yes consequences
it's every time you because we do a lot
in a few places we do predictions so
based on the current
uh position and velocity of the target
um what will be
in the next frame it will be maybe here
but you know
i mean but if it's in two seconds then
it's like well i mean the second two
milliseconds
okay your prediction is okay it's fair
it's okay it's okay
it's not you know what happens but if
it's two seconds can be anywhere
i think i think it would probably do a
whole hour just on how important
prediction is to
oh yeah ai yeah a collision avoidance
for example
um uh this next question's uh
we talked a lot about the bartender for
a lot so i don't want to spend too much
time like in the history of these shows
we've talked a lot about the bartender
so i don't want to spend too much time
but we do have two questions about the
bartender basically the first one is
what's next after the bartender now that
the bartender is in
uh what's next for social ai uh they're
referencing shopkeepers air traffic
controllers
uh other civilian roles what can you
tell us
yeah so currently i'm working on um this
this this metal behavior which is kind
of
um part of all the very
um it's four squadron 42 that i'm
working on this very
uh specific kind of chow line metal
behavior but all of this tech
is very much geared towards
eventually providing systemic stuff for
the pu as well so
if you're eating and drinking um that's
your activity
yeah eat and drink is your activity and
you want to
satisfy your hunger getting kind of
hooking all of the bits because we've
got kind of we've had little bits and
pieces
here and there of uh we've got people
eat
looking like they're eating and drinking
but are they actually increasing their
are they consider actually consuming the
things and are those things
being done based on their current
requirements of whether they're hungry
or thirsty so um i'm bringing that
behavior in
for squadron 42 but then that will that
will then key in
and some of our other designers are
already working on say vending machine
usables and how they provide stuff so
all of these things the different
possibilities and the vendors for
example
taking the bartender tech and applying
that
that which is really just now we've got
of vend
vendor behavior and and and
making pizza vendors and and turning
turning like uh the very core features
and adding content to make those to
expand those two lots of different
situations that can be used
in the pu um and
yeah so there's there's lots of stuff
that's gonna little things that we're
working out now
are gonna be then uh allow our animators
and artists and
everyone else to generate lots of really
great content for the
pu um so that's that's currently
what we're working on with social ai
yeah we mentioned some other stuff as
well like
in the even in my in montreal we write
like for example we have like some
dancing behavior like connected to the
what andrew is working on right like as
he said it's like
the activities eat and drink is
basically what allows any character to
you know replenish his sustenance pretty
much
uh and for example if you want to use an
arcade machine or
a vending machine sorry the key machine
is more for the laser one but if you
want to you know
like it's it's food for your for your
entertain so
still still food but it's like uh
for for the vending machine right what
you use is like
they're just options so let's say you
want to search for food
it's the same as when the ban when the
vendor search for
the beard you know who can provide the
bu order
basically this is why the vendor was so
critical because he offered so many
functionality we use
everywhere else right and now it's like
you know you can check
the vendor has the same things for
example when when the pattern drinks
you can check how much is you know the
drink going down and andrew you will use
the same for when you're eating the food
right
it's like how much is how much food do i
still have to finish it
and it's the same with the vending
machine you say oh i want to buy some
food
where is it it's like oh it's in the
muscle oh it's in the vending machine or
is in this shop right you say
and then based on where that is we can
execute different type of
subactivities that are in essence the
part of our behavior tree
you know behavior flow um it's really
more
like a baby graph there but basically
it's like then we can understand
how to then use that that uh the concept
basically that is like oh it's food
inside the vending machine
and now we want to interact with that
ambition how you want to consume it
and then i think it's just like and then
you can use it to how you want to
basically dispose of the what remains
right
if you're in the you know like what
you're working on andrew is like even
like bringing back you know your tray
and it's the same as like we have like
some trash can where you know if you're
eating like a
candy bar right then you want to throw
away your your your paper
right there and i think this is all
stuff that right now is possible
because of also the bartender because
the part that takes off the glass if
it's it
place it back into the dishwasher
dishwasher is just something that
accepts objects
and takes care of this you know of
cleaning that up so i think
it is really opening up a lot of you
know the doors actually what then
mention as well the refilling of the of
the ammo clips is the same
so basically the ammo boxes are just
usable that can provide you are you know
either
bullets or you know magazines that's
just just
just it and then you as an eye you can
say like i need bullets where do i find
them right it might be another ai
it might be the ammo box and then you
execute the behavior to basically get
what you what you're trying to
get i think this is gonna be really
interesting because he really opens up
this realism
a bit more and our game is very physical
right so if the guy needs to get the
ammo clip you know it's really like
there's really an ammo a magazine there
inside the box that if the play arrives
first
he takes it you know and i think this is
gonna be really
really cool to see it happen it's great
to see these little building blocks of
different behaviors that we
because we we're putting them together
now in a lot more complicated ways that
we can build on those
on those successes and build that level
up
and getting someone to who just said i
i'm hungry
he can go through all of this sub-bits
of logic and it all
it suddenly produces lots of variety of
behavior
i mean i think even thinking about oh if
he's he's hungry
but he's not 100 hungry that he might
not finish all of his food
i might go and have to then dispose of
that or or things like that
it's really interesting yeah and the
more time busy you add more complain
like the i at the end is about
complexity right so it's like for us
it's building something that allows us
to
you know add as much complex as we can
over time right so if at the beginning
you just go there you finish your food
that's fine and then there's like next
iteration you say oh now we actually had
all this
this kind of uh taste right on top of
the behavior
and then we add more complexity and then
it just looks more and more
real and with the systemic stuff as well
the the food that you're eating isn't
just making you hungry also might if you
for example if you're drinking beer it
might make you drunk
yeah and if you're yeah
getting away from the ai stuff now uh
the last bartender question
uh i promise uh speaking of bartenders
when will they start knocking the i
almost said the word
knocking out players that jump behind
the bar
so i think basically right now we only
complain right the bartender only
complains right just like hey you should
go out
because i think it is part of i think
about the gameplay
and priorities on that one you know and
uh we are working a bit a bit on the
melee as soon as we work on the melee
behaviors as well we
use that one you know it's not like
crosstalk i think it's also a matter of
you don't expect every bartender to do
this a bartender
microtech is just going to call security
a bartender
in uh i don't know a shady place is my
might pick up a bat and whack you off or
just punch in the face whatever
uh we also have to balance what happens
with the other players
because there might be another player
waiting to get their drink and
do we interrupt that maybe it's just
smarter to just call security and
that he can continue serving drinks at
that point and security will come and
we'll deal with intruder
it's probably less less disruptive for
the player wanting the drink because
then you will have a player that just
jumps behind the bar parting that takes
care of him that guy jumped
just behind the bar they just blocked
that bartender forever just by
getting in in the they should fight
between each other and at that point
hey just stop punching my bartender just
start kiting one bartender to the other
bartender
um we're going to take a moment here
we're about to halfway point
um and address the the current server
outage here
uh as many of the folks in the chat are
aware
uh at the launch of our iae this
uh this year um some of the
platform back-end service stuff is
wasn't quite ready uh to go it wasn't
ready for the
influx of people this is a this is a
thing that happens almost every single
year
we we do our best to plan for it we do
our best to prepare for it
and yet it happens um
i don't have any information about the
solution at the moment
uh as you folks are experiencing right
now
sometimes it it comes up and then it
goes down what not
uh i can say that in this this internal
chat that i'm looking at um there's a
lot of
fire emoji a lot of fire gifts
um at least three people are drinking
heavily i don't think they're actually
involved in the fix they're just
watching
the people who are and
one person suggested turning the whole
thing on and off again
so i assume we'll try everything at some
point so
guys i i we're here i'm i'm a video
producer
our guests today are members of the
esteemed ai team chosen to be on the
show this week because
they have no involvement in this the
launch of this uh promotion that's going
on today
so we are here so that the important
people who can get this stuff up and
running
can continue to do their jobs and
resolve this issue as quickly as
possible
so we understand you're frustrated um
oh there's flood gifts now i don't know
if is a flood
more better or worse than fire i don't
know when computers are concerned
uh either way we're going to continue on
with the show i just we're at the
halfway point i wanted to give you an
update
uh if we hear anything more before the
end of the show i'll come back with more
let's get back to the uh to the ai stuff
all right
creatures uh a couple weeks ago
months ago time in 2020 is blurred
it might have been a lot more than that
uh we showed uh
some creatures on ise early creature
development
one of the most popular questions has
been coming through uh has to do with
the work
with the related ai work wanting to know
uh if that's
begun yet or not and if so where are we
at
so i think we basically started to
discuss
some of the creature we want to
i saw your face guys i would say oh
maybe i need it or something i'm just
talking
again yeah basically the
somewhat decreases we want to to tackle
first uh
i i have like some of the basic
ideas on how to structure the code uh
kind of clear
you know especially in my head and i
need to possibly talk a bit more with
andrea as well about this uh
but the idea is is is that we will we
already splitting kind of creatures in
in different groups right there are
smart creatures and you know less
markers
like of course if you want to simulate
something like frogs or fishes you know
they don't require like
crazy um behaviors running on
on them you know they might require a
little bit of behavior right but not
much mastery communication audio or
something like this
and some animation playing uh plus i
think there are like this split
uh the way i want to to progress on this
one is that there would be a basic
flocking uh kind of state in which they
can decide to be part of a flock and
when they're part of the flock
the flock kind of simulates them uh you
know and this can become also part of
the more intelligent
animals like you know you have ships you
have like you know kind of flying
something sometimes they move
as a flock and then when they want to do
something specific
when you as a play interact with them
then they can go into this extra mode
that is like
i'm running a full-blown behavior
possibly to
defend myself attack myself and
something so the basic
structure that you know we
we work on is you know it's pretty much
kind of following this line uh
basically subsumption code subsumption
behavior can be run on any entity for us
so it's not really
anything related to mpc all the human
mpc
or you know hdnpcs is really any any
object can be uh
uh an ii agent you know as we call they
can move around we can define them i
know how they move
uh we can have different uh but
following styles for animals of course
you know and different type of
actions for example the stuff that i was
talking about before like the navigation
links right those can define how you
jump over objects or how
you use some objects to perform you know
special actions i imagine you
jump against a you know tree and then
you just jump on top of a guy
these are special action that you can
use you can you know dynamically
checked similar to how you know a ship
would do a special
you know action or you know uh wants to
show off
and um yeah basically
not sure if he answers all the you know
questions there i don't know
then if you want to add anything on that
uh
no the question is basically whether we
have started development and i think
we're
very early yeah
very early i think the guys that are
working on the actual creature lore and
the creature
uh art concept art are uh ahead of us
but that is generally
a good place to be uh i think the the
main reason where
where we are now is because we're still
focusing on
on the on the human yeah it's priority
definitely a higher priority if this was
a hunting game about hunting animals
then
animals would have been our priority but
for now we need to get humans
and maybe also some of the aliens needed
for
for squadron in a decent state before we
move to this
otherwise we would have to create an
extra team which means we get another
uh we pull resources from uh
from the existing teams and it's it
would be a risk right now we'd rather do
one thing to it properly then move to
the next
priority is always at the heart of every
game development decision it's just
as no matter even with what is now you
know
five studios six studios around the
world uh
500 s somewhere almost 600 people around
the world
there's still a finite number of
resources and only so many things
that can be worked on the only thing we
can do and this is what we usually
really do is try to be smart right so if
we make a systems that we know it might
be eventually
not you know used by by the creatures as
well of course we do it
in the proper way so that even if you
are not really starting officially they
work on that you know
when you start you start a little bit
ahead right like all this usable
code for example again creatures are not
necessarily always like on ground as
well right
they might be you know flying ones and
some of these they used the same code
that we use for
you know to find a pretty path on you
know
on a planet surface it's pretty much the
same thing we use it you know and
we implement in a way which can be used
in a generic way
and things like flocking behavior for
example can feed back into
the crowd behaviors the humans
and i was actually thinking about um if
it's if they're kind of cosmetic
creatures um you could that's one
example of where you could have the
ai actually being on the clients or on
the servers because they're flocking if
you've
got like a flocks of butterflies or
something like that if you can't catch
them or
interact exactly right then
simulated to really high fidelity on
your on your clients rather than the
server
and get something really reactive but
can be very effective
um seeing lots of flocks of small
creatures could be really cool
uh will having a pet of some kind
be possible yes it would be possible
because it's very similar to a friendly
npcs you know somebody like kind of when
we talk about you know crew management
is that you hire a person i said well
you know you buy a pet
and it's you know of course their
behavior is going to be different you
know maybe the comments you can give
them you know might be different you
might interact in a different way
but under the hood is really the same
system and this is where i was saying
like
it is cool because what we we are making
the same way like when when you open up
the door
from the vendor to do a lot of behavior
it's like that opens up also a lot of
other stuff from the
from the animals from the pet right the
pet might want to just find food
you might put food into a little bowl
and when he searches for food
he finds the ball that you place there
right so i think that is all
cool stuff and of course pets were one
of the original one of the
one of the later but maybe even the last
of the original stretch goals
uh back during back during the original
campaign so um
i last creature related question this
one's from me will we be able to pet the
dog
yes i hope so okay because that's the
cuddling as well
don't don't put pets in and not let us
pet the dog all right
um i'll be very careful allowing players
to pick up the
pick up the dog i'm scared what they'll
do to that
well careful careful they say pick up i
didn't say pick up
well if you cuddle him you have to pick
it up somehow okay i'll be back
if you're worried about that wait until
the tractor beam attachment
you can see claire is looking at the dog
inspecting the dog and then throwing
them
bad bad idea bad dog
all right back on track um let's get
back to some humanoid ai here
uh well ai in the game
found it like npcs and stations towns
stuff like that
or or even wildlife okay follow and use
the same survival requirements that
players
currently do uh basically will ai
get hungry will they get thirsty will
they have to heal
stuff like that absolutely so this is
basically what andrew is working on is
exactly the stuff with them and these
were also like creatures would be the
same right
so christian would use you know this
stat system you know they would get
you know angry humans you know will get
angry
uh they will have to you know find some
food uh of course we are not doing like
uh
the same simulation way you know that's
the bar and stuff like this but
based on your flow what if you know if
you are working you know immediately
like you're really like a
uh an airplane pilot for real right then
you get hungry it's not that you say oh
bye guys you know you just leave the the
cockpit then you go eat something
so you can sustain you know these these
values and you can do it at the right
moment
but you know we will basically have
these these needs that they need to be
fulfilled to
perform better right if you are like
super hungry and swear thirsty you're
fighting you're not gonna be as
efficient you know
uh as if you are like just fed up and
full energy
then do you want to add some more stuff
on the design side
uh no i think that pretty much covers it
it's just a
simplified simulation that we we're
definitely not
don't want to use as many resources from
the server side as the player does it's
just
of course the effect is going to be the
same the guys are going to
have needs basically they're going to
have hygiene
they're going to have food needs drink
needs so they're going to try to cover
this they're going to try
to find a place in their environment to
uh
to do this if not they'll try to find
the place outside of that they
can i travel a bit and then find what i
need
uh yeah pretty much and that's i think
definitely
i think what sometimes i think we you
know we tend to think backwards in a
sense i think those systems also help
us to drive the behavior it's not just
uh you know we want to support it
because school for ray is really like
it's it's cool to have that one because
first everything works consistently
right the same things that happen for
the player happens for the idea is
actually
running the same code as the play it is
sort of you know
player on the server in a sense uh uses
the same you know
of course like there are some
adjustments on the state machine based
on needs that we have but you know the
same machine is the same
the systems are the same they're just
actor and
in terms of of the game um
but really that one helps us also
driving like a realistic behavior right
otherwise what you do
just to run like randomly you go to eat
something and stuff like this but then
it's very hard
like you lose the context and that
context you need to put it somewhere and
that point you put it the same place
where the player is
and then the player wants is and then it
works the same and it much
it looks much colder than what you said
about
the because we've got not just because
we've got the plate
the reason why the player doing the same
thing is so useful
is because we've got this the third
person player
therefore things are driven through
animations in the same
in the exact same way that they will be
different with the ai
so yeah that behavior just falls out of
the same
systems which is really useful although
there's
always tweaks with the there's some
slight differences but yeah
a lot of it is so similar and so cool
that
you get that benefit so uh
so we are we are approaching the end
we've got about 10 minutes left
i do have another update on the outage
uh
there are there are many people actually
getting online and being able to access
many parts of the website so that's good
uh
but somebody from the platform team just
posted the uh
the uh indiana jones and the last
crusade gif
of choosing the wrong grail and their
whole face
melting away so that seems less good
so your mileage may vary uh
stick with it they're working on it um
as we wrap up today uh there were a lot
of questions
that were related to the idea of
ai npc crew now we've saved
we've saved a lot of these for the end
they were clearly the most
the topic that players were most
interested in when they submitted their
questions
uh we're going to talk a little bit
about that now before we wrap up today
i do want to stress that when we talk
about
early work and stuff that is farther on
the horizon this
is stuff that is farther on the horizon
so what we're going to talk about right
now is a lot of our intentions the
things that we
want to achieve with ai npc crews
like this but as always happens with
game development as other systems come
online
and as as new new tech comes available
uh these things change and evolve over
time so we are going to talk about our
current
uh we're going to talk about our current
intentions uh
with regards to ai uh mpc crew
so let's start off by first explaining
the difference
between ai npc crew and
ai server blades for spacecraft because
they are two very different things
and i think sometimes a lot of people
use the term ai interchangeably
uh to mean both so let's start off with
the differential there
i'll take that one okay no one else
wants to jump on it
that's all you dan now uh they're both
ai
they are definitely both ai especially
from our perspective they are going to
be running the same behavior
how an ai needs to aim a gun to shoot
down a ship
is exactly the same way a human is going
to aim that same gun to shoot a ship the
same behavior is going to run through
all of this
now gameplay-wise there are differences
a blade is a sub-component on a ship
you will plug it in and suddenly
sign assign a turret to use that blade
and the turret knows how to do it
there are disadvantages here uh first of
all
the blades are gonna be worse than npcs
we have this grading of the player
if you take an average player it's going
to be better than an average npc and
it's going to be better than
an average play yeah so pretty much we
automatically is not that good at the
job
the the turret blades are actually going
to occupy
a blade slot which means you can't equip
another blade for
other functionality you might want on
the ship so that is a valuable slot that
you're
losing just to have one turret start
shoot without shooting without
an npc there basically you're cheap
you're a cheap bastard you don't want to
pay someone to
to take that slot whether it's a player
or an npc
just just pay them pay the money and get
hire someone
and get them to shoot you can pay for a
blade that is the cheap alternative
don't do that
i mean do it if you can't afford
anything else and then you have
the ship is going to have only enough uh
blades to run a part of the turrets so
let's say you have a ship
like a hammerhead you won't be able to
have enough
blade slots to make all the tourists
function
so there's not that downside uh so
this is mainly where where the
difference uh runs
uh ai wise i guess uh if some of the
programmers want to chip into this with
how the behavior for this works
maybe they can clear some some stuff
behaviors are just the same behavior the
npc
we run um but maybe most importantly
the behavior will be the same the
activity be the same and maybe how you
characterize the blade uh we go through
skills so uh sort of
uh editing your uh the skills the
capacities of this
in this case i think as dan said it's
like not all the seats can be replaced
right so there would be
crew members that you know they would be
purely npcs and
and i think the critical part here i
guess is to to
like basically the same way we let
designer
in specific environment to ask npcs to
do
things right this is how under the hood
is the same way as when the player will
give them commands right if you ask an
npc
go and be the turret guy right what will
happen is the same as when
a designer set up like a mission and he
has an npc sitting on a turret you know
on a turret seat
if you ask a guy you say like you know
what i want you to fix that
panel right you can do it and it's the
same way as when a designer asks you
know an npc
to go and repair exactly that panel so
the way we build the behaviors
and you know especially like all the
this screw
management you know the the part of the
crew the guys in the crew
uh it's made in a way in which they can
perform by themselves
as best as they can their jobs based on
the skill based on the traits right
uh so imagine like you have somebody who
likes to you know uh
like just uh procrastinate you will have
your engineer that goes around and just
sometimes you find this smoking spot you
know or i don't know like some rest
and resting areas and it just hides
there and not doing its job
but you know you might have a supervisor
that goes around and sends tasks to viva
right and then you know it goes and
tries to supervise them
uh you know we have the same on the on
the bridge crew right the
captain can go around and supervise the
npc's and see if they're doing a good
job or not then maybe you know
just tell them something and uh and the
same for the player will be
basically right and then they can assign
them another thing there is like there's
more
you hire right you gameplay hire
somebody really good on shield
management
but it kind of sucks at you know
shooting you know through a turret and
if
you know maybe you need both but you
don't have enough money you know you are
one guy and then you know you live with
whatever it's most of your
needs but the good thing is that you
know these skills and levels
you know just carry through the games
it's kind of cool that you see the guy
maybe getting better at some of those
some of those will allow you to train
some others will just be your character
traits you know somebody's coward you
know and
you just put him on you know try to
defend you it's gonna just be a coward
pilot right so it might just
give up defending you if things are bad
um
you know and suddenly this but maybe
somebody super skilled you know costs
much more money
so it is going to create this extra you
know
level layer of gameplay as well yeah i
just so
yeah oh god then i would like to mention
is that
we're already building all of our
behaviors to take skills and traits into
consideration
so uh basically even the guys you
you are fighting in korea they have
skills and traits that are going to be
driving some of the decisions the
behavior
tree is exactly the same but there are
branches where it goes well do i have
this
skill to do this thing or how good am i
at doing this
this specific thing exactly the same
stuff we'll be using for
for nbc's crews basically because we
built the system in such a way where we
we we thought a bit ahead and we're like
well we want crews let's start building
the skill
the skill and trade system that's going
to dictate
how the behavior runs or how efficient
someone is at the job
and you as a player you discard that you
don't know all right so it's like there
are some traits might
enable you to do a tactic some traits
might just make a tattoo different right
it's like oh maybe you know you do that
and you're really not that good
and i'm doing it something like this or
the pc
thinks he's good at doing it but it's
not really you know you have a very
confident but stupid npc
exactly exactly problems yeah let's
especially what i've been working on
actually was the uh
we had um defining some stuff like
cowardly and show off
the pilots and you'd get show off as a
like
a show-off pilot would be more likely to
do tricks but his piloting skill would
determine
how actually useful those tricks are so
you might get a [ __ ] pilot
uh who just like really sluggishly rolls
uh just for no good reason and actually
makes himself a
better target you know
i think a lot it would be cool like to
have like readability there right with
the messages it's like ah look at me
you're never gonna catch me
and then you destroy me you know it's
like that's gonna be fun
so it sounds like so so basically
blades are a personality less
skill-less kind of bottom tier
automation for turrets only
and then above that there are ai npcs
who will have personalities and
characteristics and
aptitudes and things are good at things
they're badass stuff like this
and they can operate not only turrets
but you know other cruise stations
uh within within ships yes exactly and
you mentioned something very important
there is like the state of your
mbc crew which is like art which is
going to be important it's not just
their skills
are they well fed are they happy are
they ready
are they like almost about to leave your
ship then they're not going to do a
great job shooting someone or
manning the station they're gonna be
upset they're not gonna they're gonna
become careless
so you will need to maintain your crew
you'll need to make sure they're happy
you will need to
make sure that you provide food that's
why our ships have a kitchen have a food
dispenser
so you will need to really you take care
of them as your family if you've seen
there's there's so many sci-fi shows
that do this that
that small unit on a ship that there
there's interpersonal personal
relationship you have to occasionally
talk to them and see what's uh what's
going on you have to
watch their stats make sure they're in
peak working condition while the blade
is just
ugly yeah cool uh well guys
that about wraps it up uh thank you so
much for taking the time out of your
your busy week to
you know be here at the end with us talk
about ai as we don't get to talk with
you guys nearly enough
uh in fact when i called francesco uh
last week i'm like
hey and like i feel like he knew exactly
what i was calling because because
i hadn't called him in so long he's like
is it my time
i'm like yes it is um to pay the price
yep uh as far as a last uh update
on what's going on uh things are
beginning to come up now
the published process is beginning to
resume
if you don't know what the publish
process is that's basically everything
doesn't
turn on all the aspects of iae don't
turn on at the same time
it's it's they're all done in pieces so
so that we try not to overwhelm the
system
the system became overwhelmed in the
middle of turning on
so that's why you've seen things like
pioneer warbond but maybe not the
pioneer
credits stuff like this because the
publish was interrupted in the middle of
its checklist while when
whatever was happening i still don't
know what's happening i've been here
doing this
but i'm being told that the publish is
resuming so things are coming back
online
so we just ask for a little bit more
patience as that stuff is coming online
the best place to look for updates is
obviously the status page that they have
or you can follow along on twitter for
instance i know they're doing a lot of
status updates there
so because everything is kind of shady
we're gonna forego the raid
uh today uh and just wrap things up
there uh
william uh andrea
andrew dan francesco thank you so much
for being here
on the show this week uh allow me allow
me to salute you gentlemen
no not again not again damn
all right i'll see you later everybody
take care
bye bye
you
