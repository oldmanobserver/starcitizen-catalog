hi
everybody welcome to another episode of
star citizen live
game dev the pico proposition i'm your
host jared huckabee
and if you've never seen star citizen
live before it's where we take about an
hour
out of our day at the end of a week kick
back hang out sometimes we
do some q a sometimes we follow along
with the developer and take a look at a
bit of their process
this week we are doing the process show
and joining us on the show this week
is john carney from the uk uh
props and weapons team john how you
doing man i'm not surprised man thanks
for having me it's always a pleasure to
be here thanks for hanging out
the you've done one of one of these
shows before
yeah so when i just started a couple of
months in i was uh
i was on with uh corey for the 8.90
right and that was it that was
way over a year ago now which is crazy
coming up on two years here
is it all just blurs together for me if
i'm being completely honest
it does feel like since we've locked
down everything
everything's sort of been on pause but
then everything carries on at the same
time as well it's good
i was just saying because i'm i'm i'm on
six years at this point so it's hard to
tell the difference between
it's like what year did we do that in
what version of the show were we doing
then uh
so uh today uh as a member of the props
and weapons teams
uh we are we are going to follow along
with the creation
of a uh of an asset uh for the star
citizen persistent universe
uh can you tell us what we're making
today uh well we were such a big fan of
the halloween episode that uh we felt
that the
the diy sort of castaway pico head
uh needed to be in the game um we
decided we were gonna make it and put it
i actually if i thought about this ahead
of time i would have grabbed it hold on
so so yeah this is this this is the
online we've got to keep it in focus so
this is the
this is the pico we'll go back to full
screen here real quick so this is the
this is the picot ball uh that was
created by yours truly
for our halloween episode this year um
it it is masterful i'm not going to lie
i'm not going to lie like normally
you know it's like it's like i'll do a
little humility a little humility a
little
little humble pie here but not not on
this guy this this is this is this
over on the prop scene we were very
impressed this is this will be my legacy
uh so we are going we're going to create
we're going to see if we can't create
this
uh in engine uh for addition to the
persistent universe
so if you want why don't you go ahead
and uh share your screen
we'll get started and all right
the john carney pico proposition that
sounds like an album name
the john carney pico preposition i'll be
coming after the show
we'll get started all right uh yeah so
like all great models
it starts with humble beginnings with a
cube
um i suppose what i really explain is at
first what i was after doing was sort of
like
breaking down the model into the sort of
shapes and i'm sure like you started
with the volleyball and built onto it
i sort of wanted to approach the model
from the same way so start with a
volleyball
which a bit weird to start with a cube
but by turbo smoothing it pretty quickly
we can get a sphere
and they're already that sort of like
squared for uh sphere what
we're already 90 of the way there you
really sell the difficulty of your work
right there
done completed uh one thing i do
because i'm really lazy is i'm just
going to actually work on one face and
i'm going to copy it
around in instances so i'll sort of
explain that
that's a very common thing when you talk
to artists as much as i have
they they love symmetry because it
allows them to
just make one half of it and then copy
it
yeah work um work smart not hard that's
what i always say
so now yeah we're just going to be able
to make changes oh you know what
speaking of uh working smart i've not
actually set them as instances
so just to demonstrate for that is for
anyone at home who isn't familiar with
max's
now basically when i make changes to
this face it'll make changes to that one
we can make little dances with our
models like this um
and then yeah we need all our sides to
make it a
a good volleyball otherwise it won't
bounce very well
and then now that we've got this like
one face as well as just like making
changes to the
individual faces on it we can actually
apply modifiers in macs
that will um apply to all of them now so
if we put another turbo smooth on this
you can see it's applied to all of them
so now i can almost forget about
those ones and just work entirely off
this one
and um looking at our reference always
got to work from reference
uh these volleyballs you know they have
the they're split into sort of panels
um i was never good at sports so i don't
know i'm just
that's what i'm guessing from the photo
um so we're going to split these into
panels
so these are still part of the same
model but they're now detached so from
there we can apply
a shell modifier which is basically
going to make these planes become
3d so they have a little bit of depth to
it and
you have to crank it a little bit more
than that
so we have our sort of like rubber
panels that would go in the volleyball
and then if we apply a chamfer
to soften the edges a little bit and
then our turbo smooth on top
we should have some pretty high poly
nice looking panels
right on the high door you can see the
rest of them
these are probably going to need a 90
degree rotation on them i feel like the
uh
maker of the original volleyball be
throwing up right now and how easily
you're doing this
i spent so much time inventing the
original volleyball
and i've copied it in 30 seconds
um so yeah not good to have a holes on
your volleyball all the air is going to
come out so i'm just going to throw a
push modifier on
which as you can imagine it's just going
to push everything out a little bit
to fill the crevices and then that's it
we have our volleyball
which is it's 90 of uh of the project
um so yeah then from here we thought all
right how are we gonna how are we gonna
get tape on the model
and get that sort of tape look um so
just copying the geo of one of the
models because again i'm a lazy artist
i'm not going to make something again
remember you got an hour to fill yeah i
should probably slow down a bit
well and you know in actual production
what i did now is i made a coffee
i drank it and i played a game of pool
by myself in the office
and then then i came back to so if i
detach this now
i have my tape she's got hidden away for
a second
and i'm just gonna make my life a little
bit easier and make that a different
color so i can see it
um so we'll give that a little bit more
geo so we can play around with it i'm
gonna
show one of my favorite tools which is
the conform tool
um so if you can imagine
you know tape sits very close to what
you stick it to
right uh so to get this to stick this
closely now it could be very tedious
job of moving all the edges in try and
get it as flush as possible
so instead i use the conform tool where
i can pick a surface
in this case i'm picking this one and
now i can get all the verts and i can
it should paint and conform it
in true game that fashion it's not
working
uh uh someone in the chat was asking if
you've
if you pre-gamed any of this
if i made so if i what prepared
something earlier
yeah like like you see you seem to have
all these steps down and
you're speaking in the past tense when
you explain yourself like the next thing
i did
the next thing i did you so it's
i had a little think before the stream
of how i did it and what i was going to
talk about so
you know it's not completely off the
cusp but yeah i i i may have
done it before it might be a surprise
we'll see we'll see how far we get
in the street well it's it's people who
watch the game dev streams
know that we you very rarely if ever can
make something
in an hour in that case then yeah
the gig's up i've i've made this before
guys
but you know i'm going to show you the
to show you the steps
um you sit on a throne of lies
it's it's all real guys i promise yeah
it's just like a a
gone link dead has a it's just like
cooking on tv it's like when they sit
there they go to the cooking show
and oh yeah that's not the first time
and they said like we're gonna do this
we're gonna do it
they do all the mixing ingredients here
and they chop everything they put in the
oven and they go to the
oven that's right next to it and here's
what it looks like when it's done
yeah yeah i was i might just get it
working now and as you can see
using the conform tool i can paint this
uh
really really close to the surface to
get that tape like effect i probably
should have uh before i did that
give it a little bit of rotation because
nothing's ever perfect especially when
you're applying tape
is that a dig at me uh
let's just say we love the sort of
little quirks of the production of the
the pico high it wasn't perfect but we
love it for that hey i'm i may i made
the
i made the original in about 20 minutes
so
count disco made the original from what
i understand
that's right so yeah that's fair yeah
yeah from here same process again we've
shelled it a little bit so we get a
little bit of depth and one thing i like
to do as well
uh again to reiterate the point
nothing's ever perfect we're gonna throw
a little bit of noise on
um and that's just gonna make it wrinkly
we don't like it too wrinkly
that's probably a good example of what
your wrinkly is
as you can see a little bit of surface
noise
it adds a lot of character and again to
uh
to own up yes i have made one before
um and this is what it looks like with a
couple of more pieces of
tape on it and if i get the tape there
as well so yeah this would be
this is over number two that i'm pulling
the food out of
um you know a couple of a couple of more
times spent
applying those bits of tape and getting
it to look natural we've uh
we've basically got got this and a lot
of these wrinkles and stuff that aren't
in the high poly we can we can add one
with texturing as well you don't
have to do everything in the high poly
you're just trying to get the general
shapes and forms and so i i did the same
thing
um that i did with the tape then for the
smaller bits of tape and i
quickly modeled you know these are just
plains
have been dragged out and down to sort
of get that like card look
and same again they've had a little bit
of noise applied to them you can sort of
see
in their shape they're not completely
perfect
uh nothing ever is with especially with
arts and crafts sort of stuff
um and then yeah we've got our little a
little nose put on
and he's taped that on as well we
experiment with the idea of putting like
buttons for
eyes you know that you'd get on like
sock puppets or something but
we decided to stay true to the original
uh eco head um
and then yeah from a high poly obviously
this
super dense can't put this model in game
as much as i'd love to
uh corey would fire me uh the game
wouldn't run
so i have to make a low poly and through
texture and magic we're basically going
to get
a lot of this information onto the low
poly in the form of a texture
so i'm gonna do something called bacon
and when we're baking
basically the uh high poly is gonna sit
above the low poly and through the
magical process of bacon
it's gonna it's gonna sort of uh emboss
all that details down so i think i have
i think i have one i can show so this is
our
texturing package that we do for unique
textures i'm sure if
they've seen the sort of um show before
they know our usual workflow on props is
that we use a lot of thailand textures
and we get a lot of our details um
through pom
uh this this is one of the sort of few
instances that everyone on the prop team
uh jumps with joy to get to do where we
get to make something completely unique
with a high and low and
it just means we gotta get that extra
level of detail and stuff because we're
not relying on
doing everything with tile levels so
when we are doing those unique textures
we use a substituter so we're bringing
in our low poly which
as you can see on its own not really
getting the whole uh
not really getting the pico vibe from it
yet we bring in our high poly
which we've seen with all our tape on it
our little nose popping out and
all those little imperfections in the
noise and we can do a little bake
and that's basically getting all the
detail from the high and it's putting it
on our low and it's going to give the
illusion that there's
sort of geometry there that isn't uh so
we look at this now
we can see that it appears like there's
tape on this thing but it is actually
perfectly flat well it's very cool sure
you see where i'm coming from
and that is uh that's you've seen behind
the curtain that's how we do everything
nothing is real
everything's baked that's how you get
that's how you get it to be performative
while still maintaining you know all the
detail that people have absolutely
absolutely yeah this is this is how we
get it to to actually run as much as i'd
love to just stick the high poly model
yeah
straight in we use that we use it uh in
our ships as well you know
all that parallax occlusion mapping yeah
yeah
it's like when you see the uh the the
floor grating
that looks like there's a there's a
tract underneath your feet with a bunch
of cables and everything that's not
actually there that was tricky trick of
the year it's quite clever and
because we have that sort of technology
to do that it means that we can sort of
create a game with such
huge scope you know yeah universe size
game because uh because of all those
little sort of like savings we get from
doing things like that
um so yeah we've got our we've got our
very basic
pico with the information from the
high poly breakdown um i've gone through
the effort
all the tedious boring process of
exporting it and putting it
into uh into editor we've got our little
scene here
count disco gave me permission to make
the pico head so
in return we've given him a little shout
out on another volleyball
and to create this sort of
castaway-esque scene
you know i think every good prop tells a
story we've placed them
by the sea on the hosting so as
somewhere in the future these things
have washed up and someone someone in
the verse is going to find them
and know that uh yeah know that count
disco was here with these uh his pete go
ahead
so yeah we can't leave it like this in
the game it's a little bit boring so we
better get some textures on it
um so you might have noticed when i was
in uh max that i have all these funky
colors
on the pico head that isn't the intended
final color scheme for this thing
what i'm making is a an id map so if you
imagine when you come to
texture in the package you're going to
want to be able to quickly highlight
all the tape so i can make all the tape
the tape material i can make the
volleyball the volleyball material in
the paper this and
and uh because there's actually no
details on the low poly
there's no way of selecting where the
tape's going to be
so we bake out something called an id
mask
you can see here it's like a
it's a colorful mask that breaks
everything up i'll find a better way to
show it
so right now let's say we want the
volleyball to be
red which we don't
if we add the mask with a color
selection then pick the color we bring
our mask up
and now i can just color pick the green
um and i'll put it on the tape or i
could color pick the orange that puts it
on the nose and this is just gonna
speed up the the texture in tenfold
and hopefully hopefully means we can get
this done within the hour otherwise it
would be a very long stream
um so first things first i'll probably
start breaking things down into folders
and getting sort of like base textures
in
uh so the volleyball is obviously going
to be white but i think we'll do a bit
of like a an off-white you know
where yeah it seems it's seen some
it seems yeah yeah i mean it's washed up
and hurst and it's uh
it's uh it has it has a it's had a hard
life
so if we could pick that and we can
apply it straight to the volleyball
and as you can see we're off so we'll do
another folder this one will do
yeah i should probably set a good
example and name these things
not let everyone know how messy i
actually work in real life
for those who asked what program uh you
can see in the upper left-hand corner
right now we're in substance painter
yeah so this is um algorithmic i believe
make substance painter
we use a couple of other softwares um i
think in the 890 episode that was last
on
we were using designer
but this is painter so for this we'll do
we'll call this one
uh the black tape um
and then we'll put a layer in there and
i know you know that
material wise they're probably not being
sold as what they're intended to be at
the moment but these
we really are just like blocking in
colors the same way you know if you
if you're making a painting or a
portrait of someone you wouldn't
immediately jump into just
painting in perfect detail what their
eyeball looks like you blocking the big
shapes that's
basically what we're doing here
uh for a grand lebowski who says why are
they doing this instead of programming
uh because i am not a programmer and
neither is john yeah i mean i could i
could try and program
john is a props artist so he's he's
doing what he does
and i am a video host so i'm doing what
i do
doing a great job as well can i say
maybe yeah maybe for the next stream uh
i'll have a go at programming
see how far we get that would that
that that would be an interesting show
at some point like at some point like
i i haven't hit i haven't hit everything
we can do yet but at some point i'm
going to run out of stuff
then we'll start doing like we'll start
doing like challenge shows where we take
programmers and have them work in hr for
a day yeah yeah
just see what goes on for all the people
that seem to think
uh each person can do everybody's job
all right if only if only it was that
simple i wish it was
so we've got our masking tape folder
and then again with our masking tape
we'll do a bit of a
an off-color desaturate a bit
there we go the good thing about these
um this color mask is you might see that
there's a little bit of like bleeding
at the moment um we can play around with
the tolerance of the mask
um so we can play around
so it just covers just the edges and
that way we're not getting any of these
uh
white lines between things
um yeah so we're just missing the top
bits
yeah this would have been a lot easier
for you to if you made the diy pico head
a lot simpler you know
yeah i i mean honestly you're you're you
got based on how long it took me to make
the original you got like three minutes
left
[Laughter]
in in our artist challenge jared versus
john you if you can't finish this in
three minutes i'm
clearly the yeah i think it might be it
might be time to open the third oven
and get the finished thing out if i've
got three minutes left no
so i'm just going to play around with
this tolerance again get rid of those
you can see those white edges
disappearing on the
tape yeah all right awesome so yeah this
is
uh very boring very basic but we've uh
we've blocked it in and then here comes
the boring bits where we have to uh
export our textures and then if i've got
everything correctly linked
these should start to appear yeah we've
got our basic basic textures in
so on the sec other screen because it's
really boring i'll just
get those exported and we can get a get
a first look of what it's going to look
like
um in engine
amongst this amongst the sea
every time you say that i want to sing
beyond the sea and i'm i'm really
holding myself hey yeah don't make me
hold you back man go crazy
now i will say i noticed uh some of the
you took some artistic license with the
with the small little tape bits
yeah yeah no i like i like them i'm i'm
not complaining at all
i'm just saying yeah no my modelling
scores aren't as good as your craft
skills so that's a how to compensate you
know
i think it has a little bit of character
it does it does
um i like him he looks i don't know
about you but he looks
he's really weirding me out without any
eyes yes so
just to make me feel a little bit more
comfortable i'm just going to give him
some eyes because i don't like the
sort of like void blanks there i'm
getting from the whole thing
um so if we put a layer over everything
and we just call this
marker pen oh not market pen
and then we add a black mask but this
time rather than using the
id to mask it we can just kind of paint
straight onto it
and then we can paint our little pico
eyes um don't worry we're going to
refine those later
they're not going to stay looking like
that shimmy
this is how pico feels right now because
he uh
he's he's not looking his best that's
how he feels
so usually about now i'd go through like
my sort of second pass
of refining materials so i think we'll
do that i think we'll start with the
volleyball and
uh we'll elaborate on this sort of like
base texture
that we have so a specular we're going
to keep quite low because we don't want
it reflecting too much light
i'm going to ramp the glossiness a
little bit so it looks
sort of brand new which sounds crazy but
we're going to make it count during the
other layers so
the base one will keep it quite clean so
when we were
doing our bacon before you'll see that
we generate a bunch of masks as well as
like normal
and ambient occlusion we've got things
like curvature position thickness
those maps don't actually go in the game
but the helpers
use the smart masks in the software when
we're texturing so i'll explain that a
little bit
so just for the sake of an example we
get a really bright color like a red
and we'll uh mask it we can use
something called
smart mask which is where it's going to
sort of look at those maps that we baked
and look at the curvature of the model
look at the crevices on the model um and
figure out where things like dust
and rust would uh begin to accumulate
and it'll mask it out for us so here's a
good example this mask wow
yeah so using all those maps that we
baked from the high to the low
it's now figuring out you know despite
there actually being no crevice here
perfectly flat it's figuring out you
know on the high poly and the real thing
is where they would go and that's how we
can get that sort of like extra level of
detail on our models that
as artists we love to love to do
so for the color i'm gonna pick our base
one
and i imagine it would get just a little
bit darker in these crevices
as things like dust and dirt would get
in there and obviously they wouldn't be
very
glossy we'd want them to be quite rough
and if we throw a height layer on just
drop it a little bit
you can almost like subtract from the
model a little bit
death snake says who betsey will be a
sub item it won't be a sub item
um if i just play around with
our masks there as well we can actually
play with the intensity of how it's
spreading
i i don't actually know if i want to use
this mask i think
um try trying to remember what i may
have used on one i made earlier
i think something like this whoa
yeah so you start starting to get that
sort of like surface noise that you
would get on a as you can imagine like
quite an aged volleyball
like you know it's it wouldn't just be
perfectly smooth like this
it would have some sort of texture to it
i mean otherwise you know your hand
wouldn't grip when you're playing
volleyball
um so we pull that back a little bit
because we just want to be subtle about
it we don't want to go
overboard you know right um and then on
top of this
we'll just add a little bit of dirt so a
lot of the texturing process is like
this it's sort of like slowly building
it up in layers and then you'll go back
and you'll do another pass and maybe
you'll
take away or add a little bit more and
stuff it's a very iterative process
i think sometimes people think we just
sort of like get it right first time or
something and i
assure you that's never the case i don't
think that's ever been the case in
any video game in the history of video
game development yeah we got it the
first time
yeah nailed it i sat down and it just
like
sprang out of my head like hercules from
z from zeus just
into into creation that's not how it
works so i think we'll throw some
some like scratches on here um
again just to imply that this thing is
uh you know washed up on the shores of
hurston
it's not been well looked after again
if we uh subtract on the height we can
start to get a little bit of like
surface information not too much
you know just just a little sort of
thing and uh
yeah it's gonna i think our mask might
be played up because it seems to be
putting it everywhere
i think we'll leave the volleyball for
now and we'll move on to the tape
oh we've lost his eyes again so yeah
same thing for the tape
um we had our base layer which was just
a plain flat i think it's a little bit
too dark
and i'm just going to bring that up a
little bit same thing again we're going
to want a bit of a
sort of like noise on the surface to
really sell it as tape
so rather than add in another layer with
colors on it or something i'm going to
add a height layer
and then in the subsus design they have
all these really cool sort of like
procedural generators
that will just generate um
sort of like various types of noise um
so we'll go on here that's like a clouds
three
uh if we apply this to our height oh
yeah that's a great one
that's a great clouds three is a really
choice
it's a fan favorite that's for sure in
my heart it's clouds one
so we play around with the scale on this
um
and then would you want to drop the
intensity because this is
even for for heavy dewy doctor this is
pretty intense
um so go into our height layer and
so this side panel here works just like
photoshop in that you know we can play
around with
how the layer overlays and its opacity
and that sort of stuff
draw that down just a little bit got a
little bit of surface noise for our duct
tape
um one thing i haven't done yet which i
like to do on all my models just to
really help sell
um sort of like 3dness of it
is a one of our textures that we got
from bacon
uh ambient occlusion which is just a
sort of map that highlights all the
sort of crevices and the shadows and
stuff so this is what it looks like
like standard and then one cheeky little
trick we do
is we overlay that with a multiply over
all our other work
i just play around with the opacity here
you can see how it just sort of fills in
the crevices
yeah makes everything pop a little bit
you start to get shadows forming
in these areas which you know we're
trying to imply that these are two
little bits of paper that aren't
touching or anything
um you know we know they're actually
exactly just
one poly but uh by using our
ambient occlusion we can help help solve
that so i'm just going to do another
export again
to get an update of how uh our
volleyball material is coming
in engine i think sometimes uh
you can get quite stuck and focused on
making things look nice in here and then
by the time
you export it in engine and put it in a
hanger or wherever it is you intend for
the model to go eventually
it can end up looking completely
different to what you actually intended
it's always important that we sort of
flick back and forth even though it
involves this long tedious process of
exporting all our textures through
photoshop
okay and this should update pretty
quickly ah so there we go
i think maybe went a little bit too
yellow with the volleyball
um but yeah all our surface information
is coming through
uh ignore these bits because uh i've
just you know i've turned the layers off
so they're not appearing
um we just sort of like focusing on the
volleyball material for now
yeah i think we're getting there we're
okay with the volleyball material
we'll keep pushing all the other ones
okay so you want
you're about halfway through right now
all right awesome uh
so foil foil's always a tricky one
um trying to get like metals to render
correctly in here
and in engine they sort of render a
little bit differently so we sort of
have to
just through trial and error we know
what it's going to look like in here and
it'll look wrong but we know by the time
it gets an engine
it'll look uh it'll look it'll look
right
so from when i definitely didn't make
one prior
from what i can remember i think i used
a chrome or
uh procedural generator to get that sort
of uh wrinkly effect that you get on
foil
uh if i bring back my reference again
we're basically trying to recreate this
at the moment
um so we're just going to want this in
the height
so if we drop the height and we add a
mask
and then we use the chrome pull in our
mask
and hopefully see you know i think for
the time being i'm just going to throw a
blank material on there so we can see it
better
you can see we're starting to get that
uh that rippled effect
if we ramp that up a little bit
yeah we're starting to get that sort of
like wrinkly tinfoil i'm just going to
change the scale a little bit
so there we go now we're getting tin
foil
and then i'm just gonna drop the
intensity of it a little bit
it's a little bit too much for my liking
and then get rid of the layer i just
added
you see you can get lost quite quickly
with all the other layers you're adding
especially when you're
being naughty and not naming it
see if our foil is looking like foil and
engine again
are people uh people liking pico in the
uh in the old shot
for the most part some some some
some folks are are
let's just let's just say that the uh
the mercury star runner hit the ptu
yesterday so
we've got some attention com uh
competition at the moment
all right it's a big picture
that's a good looking ship
hey we've not finished yet man don't
we're not down and out yet
we've still got 30 minutes to sell pico
[Laughter]
look at that the tinfoil coming through
you're telling me that the ship looks
better than this tin foil
i don't know this is pretty good
yeah i hope you can see as well the the
difference and
how it renders in the in the package
it looks like black treacle but uh yeah
just trial and error through uh texture
and so many props
you can almost see what it's gonna look
like an engine by how bad it looks like
in painter
yeah i i feel like uh
some of the wrinkles that you added to
the foil
would probably work for the tape as well
not to that extent but as i'm looking at
the original
uh the tape is actually fairly wrinkled
as well
yeah we could probably add that and then
change the scale so it's probably not as
scaled under yeah because you don't want
it to look just like a different colored
foil
yeah totally change the severity change
the scale
from the original pico creator himself i
will be here
on his suggestion i'll be adding some
crumples
um i just will put it in the height
again
we'll add a black mask we'll use our
crumples again
definitely getting my use out of the
crumble texture today
at some point after this goes into the
uh
after this goes into the uh pu
there'll be there'll be people who take
this thing and take it to the basketball
court
oh you couldn't do that to pick up use
the new improved throw
so yeah maybe something maybe something
like this it's not quite as intense i
think one more thing we could do is
probably
if we added a blur to the crumbles so
they're a little bit softer
uh dragon ghost says can you confirm
price on msr no
john is a props artist he does not have
that information
nor do i as a video person
i could have a guess
um if i just get the base texture i
think the our tape's probably looking a
little bit too shiny
for tape so i'm just going to drop the
glossiness a little bit
and hopefully if we compare our gloss
values in here
yeah we should get a little bit of
contrast uh i think the noise we added
as well
i'm gonna see if we can add a little bit
of that noise in the gloss so if we go
back to our procedural
generators again and we'll look for a
grunge one
i do appreciate the harry carry
reference stone steeler
i worked with real hairy carry in 1995.
that was the year i was born i hate to
make you feel old oh
that was the year i was born ah it was a
good year
you you met that person i was born
maybe evens out
yeah and i'm asking tapes again though
it's an iterative process i'm
i'm not putting a you know i'm putting a
pin in the uh the tape for now we'll
come back to that
masking tape it's not a whole lot you
can do with masking tape it's pretty
plain
but uh we'll do our best we're gonna
drop the gloss on it a little bit
because it's not very glossy
i think i'm just going to bump the
height a little bit as well and that's
just going to make it uh
pop out a little bit really give that
illusion of depth
um i might just lighten that color a
little bit
there we go a bit more masking tape
um and he needs his beak picot picot's
got to have his beak
his beak was originally created from a
uh the
manila envelope that uh the uh brian
chambers wig was shipped to us in
i was i was wondering why you got the
yellow card i thought i thought you'd uh
well i should say i thought uh count
disco had gone to the craft store and
you know really
really went all out on the pico head
you know i should probably be looking at
my uh
my reference as a good artist should i
think
see a question from the chat uh does the
pickleball come with lti
of course
put this in a little folder called
pico is very important beak
he's lifetime terror insurance
okay he's really coming to life now i
think i think i think the big selling it
once again gonna drop the glossiness on
that it's a very shiny beak
and for his helmet tops
they're great again not so much you can
do with them they are just card after
all
drop the gloss on those there we go so i
think we should probably jump into uh
into the pen and some pen details
the pen details uh
and then we need uh i like the eyebrows
the original well it looks a little
aggressive well
technically the the original did have i
i guess it's kind of a unibrow
let me let me can you can you see the
camera as i'm as i'm showing it to you
so so so like like the tape ended here
yeah and then this is drawn in the this
is this is this
this is drawn in in the same thing so
yeah okay we'll do that the creator has
spoken
well um just kind of i could just keep
this here and just make it
i'll start comparing it and it'll make
it'll make me feel bad
i know i can never live up to it no it's
great like i said i
i really like the the the little it's
like scotch tape editions
yeah it's i think it's a they're a
genuine improvement on the original
okay oh he's not supposed to be that
cool
you know what i'm gonna start with a new
texture
i promise when i uh when i'm not making
things on stream
i am very meticulous and i name all my
layers
i see if cory's listening to this some
layers are called new layer one
terrible to show the folder of how many
final versions of even
even just the halloween episode there
was there's you know final v2
really final final this time one one one
one i've i've been there
um okay yeah so probably won't
paint with this because it doesn't look
very pen like so we'll go back into our
alphas
and we have lots of cool uh swirly brush
type ones
they're a little bit more marker penny
and
we're going to do some other tricks down
the line to really help sell it as
as pen so just bear with me audience
for the time period um
i get my uh my reference up again
yeah so he's got these big mono brows i
see what you've done you've tried to
you've you've used the tape to bulk in
the most of the the color black and then
you've
you've sort of softened the edges with
your pen am i right actually no i i only
did the pen in the in the center there
was no pin on the other ones
no no the side no there's no there's no
pain on the sides at all
that's correct it's just it was just in
the center
okay no problem yeah just just the
monobrow in the center
there we go see he's got he's got a lot
more of a face now i think yeah yeah
he's looking a bit yeah the monobrow was
essential
it was it was definitely a deal breaker
yeah without it it was not pico
okay yeah no so i think i'll do the eyes
on another layer because i have a
suspicion that
i will say i'm doing this with a mouse
right now and i usually have a tablet so
my drawing abilities it's not the best
right now hey
paul jones draws with a mouse paul jones
has the steadiest
mouse hand of any human being i've ever
seen i'm not there yet
i'm getting there like like we actually
we did a little
we did a little competition with with
paul jones once like he he can draw
a perfectly straight line without the
mouse
with a mouse without holding down you
know any alignment
keys he don't you don't think he's got
like a ruler on his mouse mat
he's tricking you i've seen it i've seen
i've seen your life i just it just
you just you just like he did it once
and we're like that's a fluke
and he just went line after line after
line up the line
like how does that happen and he's not
rocking like he's not rocking like a 600
mouse or anything with 9 million dpi he
just
he's just it's just the man just magic
so i noticed uh in all your eye drawing
ability
we've just got a little bit of white a
little bit of black missing on the end
there
yeah that was my artistic flair oh
hey i was sold man
i think it really adds character you
know if we zoom out now
yeah the one on the right a lot more
character yeah
there you go so it's a little rough
we'll export this we'll go we'll get a
little update on how it's looking in
editor
and uh yeah we'll we'll come back on
iterate
this is not the final version of the ice
no
do you think uh do you think count disco
would approve of this so far
so far i'm curious what we're going to
do for the visor though
oh i might have not had a plan for the
visa
i was wondering i was like in all the
versions you've shown me
the visor hasn't been there man you
picked 45 minutes in the stream to to
point out the visor
we could have gone back to like minute
three i could have done but don't know
about that
i so i suppose um i mean i said at the
beginning every
every good prop has a little bit of
storytelling in it we could say the
visor
fell off in its journey across the
oceans
we not sold not sold
i i i i'm i'm i'm i'm just i'm i'm just
curious to see what you're going to do
yeah it fell off pico um
prizes for when you're in space and uh
he's on the planet now so he's popped
his visor up he's hidden away behind the
tape
and uh yeah he's just chilling now i
keep forgetting to get rid of that uh we
went really yellow on the ball
yeah and it lived the weathered life but
i don't know if it lived that was a
double life
just gonna go back and tweak that
and we'll make a little light a little
bit more
see dissatisfied iterative this is the
this is the side of art you probably
don't get a c which is me spending 20
minutes
uh changing it going into engine going
no coming back
changing it uh and then changing it back
and then
settling for what i originally had in
the first place eventually
so i'm gonna get rid of that find our
marker pen
which i definitely
and then yeah over time you know like
marker pen always gets like rubbed away
and stuff
we're gonna try and like recreate that
effect of like uh
you know it's sort of missing in the
texture of the ball and the crevices and
stuff so we put this in a folder
and we call er pen
and we're going to do exactly what we
did before when we were sort of adding
details to the crevices of the
volleyball
but this time we're going to take away
so rather than adding pen to the
crevices we're gonna take it away from
the crevices and stuff and
hopefully get that sort of rubbed effect
on it um
so if we go back into our smart masks
and we'll look for
[Music]
you know what we'll just play around
with all of them
yes red wolf the whole scl is going to
be
this
[Laughter]
every friday 50 some odd weeks a year
after six years there's like hundreds of
these this is what this one is
so you can see we're sort of getting it
it's like rubbed away a little bit
that's cool yeah it's probably a little
bit intense
we keep it at that for now and then one
thing i always like to do just to give a
bit of a human touch because
these automated generation things never
sort of get it
always quite right needs an artist's
touch otherwise i'm out of a job
needs a nice touch definitely let's have
computers do everything
so if we make you know what this isn't
the brush we want
how about however else
think something like this and we just
imagine
that as uh count disco is making it
his uh his elbow has just just smudged
the corner of the eye a little bit but
he's not bothered to
put it back he's fine with it and then
when he was doing the other side he's
oh no he didn't smudge it that much his
elbow smudged it a little bit there as
well
and somewhere in his journey across the
universe flown across the ocean
lost a little bit there as well um
i'm not making this up these are all
artistic decisions that i'm making
years training go into this sort of
decision making
that's what i want to know well not too
many years mr i was born in 1995
too many years um two maybe three
i lost a little bit more here and yeah
there's just a lot more character now if
we
you know just a little bit more
yeah see how this comes out
you know what whilst those exploring as
well i'll do a little bit more work
giving you two birds one stone um so our
card at the top it's probably looking a
little bit boring i think we're going to
need a little bit of texture for that
um so we've got our base one here we've
dropped the gloss so it's a bit more
papery
i'm just going to add another layer and
we're going to do what we did before i
don't think we're going to use the
oh no actually we'll use the crumple
again we'll get we'll get our use out of
it today
chat's pretty insistent on the visor i
don't think we'll have time for the
visor today guys
yeah maybe i could after the stream i
could make a few tweaks
unfortunately the visor requires going
back like to step three
[Laughter]
and adding it before we baked it down
was was no one buying the story that it
fell off in space
was no one no one buying that this is
this is the star citizen crowd
please no no no that's that's not true
it's just about it's just about fidelity
yeah i mean it's about they know a
thing's supposed to be there and it's
not there
they're big pico fans they know they
know how we should look
and i understand yeah it's just so yeah
it's just about the fidelity i've got
the crumples on the top so
it's getting a little bit more solder's
paper now if i just turn that off you
can see what we had before versus what
we have now
um in fact i think i've done such a good
job on that if i say so myself
i'm going to do it for the the nose as
well because it's a little bit weird
that everything got so tattered
in space but his nose
remained pristine so i think we're going
to need a little bit on his on his nose
and
drop the height once again add a mask
yeah so we'll explore that we'll see how
this is looking in uh
in engine
i wonder if we could paint a visor on
you've got 10 minutes left got 10
minutes i think i'll go
do a couple more uh editions
and then i may i may open the third oven
and reveal a finished one
but i think i think we've done quite
well for 45 minutes if if anything
i think i think my lead corey's gonna
he's gonna have some questions about how
quickly i've done this
i think he's gonna be cracking the whip
on monday a little bit too quick
ah there we go our details are coming in
now yeah i think that's the right amount
of uh
sort of disheveledness yeah grunts
the tin foils still looking quite shiny
i think what i'm gonna start doing now
rather than working on each of the uh
individual materials is sort of like uh
start focusing on the sort of that
accumulates over the whole thing because
you know it's looking quite pristine
considering it's uh it's literally
washed up on the banks
outside laureville with all the rubble
and the the space seaweed
so yeah we'll do a couple more sort of
overall passes with grunge
if i stick all of this in a folder
i will just call it
um call it base it's got the base
and then we'll add a dirt layer so
we get looking for that sort of like
maroony
brownie wet sort of mud
but then you know we probably don't want
to be too specific to this area if it's
going to be across the universe so
we'll keep it sort of like generic
generic sort of dirt
there we go and uh dirt is very rarely
glossy
so we'll bring that right back and we'll
turn off the normal
keep the height and add a little bit of
height information to it so it pops
and then we're gonna go play around with
those smart masks we've been playing
around with so much today
so again using all that sort of
information we baked out like its
position in the world we can do all
sorts of cool masks like uh
ground dirt so it will literally know
what the base where the base of this
model is and where the top is
um from the maps that we baked and be
able to
sort of mask the dirt specifically to
the bottom
you see we're we're just getting it on
the bottom yeah and i'll
fade out slowly upwards just gonna pop
the height on that a little bit
really drop the gloss on the spec
yeah pico seen bad days that's for sure
i have to bring the angry eyebrows back
i don't think you'd be happy about this
um we'll do one more so at this point as
things start to get noisy
i start to sort of like put like debug
colors on so i can actually see what i'm
doing as i'm applying it
and then go back so no one should be
worried i'm not gonna just pop bright
red all over this
um so if we get for a a sort of
i want sort of like an overall wear on
everything so maybe a dust
seems to be applying all over the place
so yeah now that i can
sort of get how i'm applying it to be
where i want
you know it's it's building up like
quite naturally in the crevices but
you're still getting it over the general
surface
as well once i've sort of like settled
on that then i can get rid of the
creepy color red to something a little
bit more small
there we go and just drop down a bit
all right i'll get that overall dirt
going
okay that is a very disheveled pico uh
wonka says just add the words replace me
to the red and call it done
uh true story of funko the third
volleyball the mark hamill volleyball
was going to be a replacement ball
i was going to paint the entire ball
read and write replacement
until will uh
will had the idea for the mark camo ball
and i'm like i'm like that's better
that was one of my favorite props from
um citizencon last year
uh a bunch of people who came to the
event and had their stalls they
obviously sort of like
dressed the stalls and they had all
sorts of like props from the game i
think i have one here someone made like
a 3d printed a medical pen
and stuff and one of my favorite ones is
someone that actually just made a
replacement cube
and just had gone round the event
placing it in random places
you know like where i thought like a
plant pot would be or something and
you just have this bright red
replacement i thought it was funny
as well as some turtles as well do i
hide in turtles around the event as well
i thought i was going crazy at one point
i just kept countering all these uh
turtles hidden in stairwells and well
the turtles are all you guys you're the
ones who
was that with those those no the the
first turtle that was that was just put
in
game randomly that was from that was
from your team
i'm saying oh no i mean i mean at the
event they were placed everywhere oh
no someone had brought model turtles and
placed them all around
all round citizencon as well as these
replacement cubes
i really thought i was going crazy at
one point
okay if we go back to engine now okay
yeah all are where
and stuff starts coming in i think it's
just updating
um one of the maps this is where
super fast hard drives come in handy
this one might be on its last legs
i just ordered a i just ordered an eight
terabyte m2 that's arriving tomorrow
am i right i'm thinking the n2 that's
the ones that plug into your motherboard
right
yeah man those are the really really
quick ones right
yeah man i'm pretty jealous i remember
when ssd was as fast as you could go
you know
um i think what we went on five minutes
left i
think now is time to maybe
see behind the red curtain open the the
third open door
reporter's like how much did that cost
i'm not thinking about it
[Laughter]
no just install it don't think ask
questions later
um i'm gonna reveal what i managed to
get up to
i probably shouldn't delete my work but
before the stream
i had to go a texture myself and you can
see i went through the extra details
yeah of adding on his beak gives him a
lot more character
you drew on the unibrow there yeah i
drew on here i drew things around here
as well i thought
it works too i mean it all works it all
works
it's i'm sold it looks to pico like me
um and yeah i spent a really long time
trying to get like directional stuff on
the duct tape for this
it took more than the the 55 minutes
we've been making this so i didn't want
to
i didn't want to go into too much detail
on the duct tape on stream because uh
that's a rabbit hole we do not have time
to go down
um so let's get the final version or
what could be the final version i'm i'm
i'm starting to think that maybe i could
add some
lenses but let's get the [ __ ] yeah i i
think before we can
make like not for the stream today but i
think before we
sign the thing off yeah yeah we have to
we have to we have to take a shot at the
lens
it's a it's a it's a critical part oh
he's just not the same without him i
think that's why he has such a sad
expression in his face
he's missing he's missing his lens yeah
you've got maybe he's just got really
sore eyes because of all the dirt that
keeps going and
you've got mando without his helmet
right now
okay i'm just exporting the final
textures now
i imagine my computer's so slow it's
probably
it's probably still loading the textures
i exported last time
um and we're gonna need our spec
so that's exporting as well it would be
just my luck that we come to the end of
the stream and as i try and present the
final one
none of my textures will load we're just
left with this uh
that is how it happens i'm just thinking
uh you know a couple of minutes to go do
i risk do i risk reloading the level
in a and i hope that it will work
i'll see uh it's probably just like uh
my taxes are just compiling in the
material or something
[Music]
very strange all right well
maybe we'll wrap it here while you you
can you can address that
um john thanks so much
man thanks for taking the time to make
my personal pickle ball dream a reality
uh uh as for of the folks who the folks
who have uh
been asking uh where pico will go in the
verse uh we don't know yet
uh it won't be a subscriber flare won't
it won't be anything that
you know costs money or anything uh the
props team was just like we'd like to
make it and stick it in the verse
somewhere fun
so uh i have no idea uh if
if or when it gets added you guys can
tell me because i honestly won't know
um we are gonna throw the raid today to
who are we who are we rating molly uh
most noodle we are rating moist
noodle today uh uh she says he's a pvp
extraordinaire he's he's all right
moist and i go way back he's all right
he's he's all right
uh he is he pvp streamer uh he's he's
playing on the live
environment right now uh so yeah so
we'll throw the rate over to moist
uh tell him uh tell him uh
i don't know sound pico says hi
all right uh for john i'm jared uh take
care everybody
we'll see you next week
you
