## Transcript

hi everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live
uh affecting visuals i'm your host jared
huckabee
and if you've never seen star citizen
live before it's where we take an hour
out of our week and
bring some developers onto the show and
we we take questions from
the star citizen community and pose them
directly to the developers
usually over some manner of video
conferencing especially in our new work
from home era today
we have three members from our esteemed
visual effects team on the show let's go
ahead and introduce them
see who we're talking to today um we
will start
we'll just go clockwise from the top leo
tell us who you are and what you do for
star citizen
hi i'm leo i'm a vfx programmer
so i work in the vfx team i help
the vfx team with like producing tools
and implementing systems that will drive
vfx um in the game
i'm mainly focused on on the gameplay
side of
vfx so when certain effects
should trigger how uh
like different systems try to trigger
vfx i provide tools to other programmers
to
add vfx themselves to their uh systems
and so on so let's uh what are some
shorts what are some of the things that
you've worked on personally uh
uh for for for starter season so folks
can uh
know what you've touched what what to
ask um i've
worked a lot with uh ship vfx so
thrusters uh atmospheric gantry trails
like wing chip for dishes and contrails
um i've done some work on the weather
like all the wind implementations
that's something i've been working on
and
recently i've been working on fire um
which is in very early stages but yeah
it's an ongoing project yeah we've
really enjoyed
following along with your with the
process of it in our in our sprint
reports it's been a big hit among the
community
so i think we're all very excited about
the possibilities
of fire down the line uh moving
immediately clockwise from
leo mike uh you probably need no
introduction at this point but we're
going to do it anyway
who are you what do you do for star
citizen i'm mike
and i'm the vfx director so i i direct
and run the vfx team got to see don't do
that
not really no i'll leave it to these
guys
right and uh you already know who i am
so we'll continue on
clockwise uh uh tio who are you and what
do you do for star citizen hi
i'm teo and i uh do visual effects on
visual effects artists i
generally create particle systems and
textures
and work with the tools that leo and the
rest of the programmers
provide to populate the world
and make things like impacts
uh recently iworks worked on the
atmospheric entry effects um
and yeah environments
clouds smoke smoke fence all that kind
of stuff
cool well this week's show is a
generalized question and answer show
about vfx
so we will be taking questions live from
the twitch chat during the show you can
submit your questions for consideration
by posting them with the word question
in capital letters surrounded by
brackets
that'll help our community management
team pull them out from all the other
chat and send them
on to me we also as usual put up a
thread earlier in the week
where we allowed folks to post questions
in spectrum
and vote up which ones they wanted to
see answered most so we'll go ahead and
start with those
just a general reminder that these are
the visual effects teams
so while there are certainly some
gameplay elements related to it like
leo said it's like this in general
if you're if the question is how do you
create
weather we're on board if the question
is how will weather affect my spaceship
when i do this
that's the realm of designers and stuff
like that so so
again just as we're cultivating
questions you want to try to stick to
the actual
effect itself and the creation of the
effects that you've seen throughout
star citizen uh so right off the bat
the number one most voted question we
just we always start with with the
number one right off the bat
uh mike uh lots of people want to know
how the work
on the new shield vfx are going uh we've
been talking on and off about new shield
effects for for some time now it's been
progressing steadily really it's going
well i would say
we've recently i guess come to the end
of our what we call the pre-production
side of it there's been a lot of we've
recently started to invest more time
in in concept in these kind of effects
where there's not really any real world
reference
so yeah we we've got a guy in our team
who who does the concepts
vfx and and it's fantastic to have that
so
that that side of it's done we've had uh
we've had simon our lead vfx programmer
working closely with caleb our principal
vfx artist on the pre-production so
actual in-engine
uh code side of things shaders looking
at the the kind of graphics options
we've got
um kind of slightly wackier ideas as
well stuff that's not necessarily in the
concepts the
the kind of just ideas that come when
you when you see this kind of thing
so yeah i mean i say we're i would say
we're pretty much
close to wrapping up the pre-production
which means that we're going straight
into the production phase which is what
people care about because that
that's where we actually start to make
the effects a reality and put them into
the game
um so yeah going well now
the pre-pre-production phases often vary
in length some some pre-production
phases are only a week or two
you hit something real fast and some
pre-production phases take quite a bit
of time like this one has
uh was some of that due to waiting for
various sdf tech coming online
yeah very much so so we we knew from
quite an early stage really i know that
the backers
have been aware of this for a long time
that the the sdf the signed distance
field
we knew that we were going to be using
them to to generate these effects and to
have the effects kind of driven by the
sdfs
so we knew there was a lot of work that
was upstream we sort of used
terms upstream and downstream we're one
of those teams that are downstream from
other teams
so we knew there was a lot of work that
was going on with the vehicle teams
and the physics teams that that was
necessary in order for these sdfs to
become a reality
um so yeah that was that was a large
part of it that that was
not really why anything was delayed but
that was what we needed to be able to
to have in for us to do our thing as
well um
so yeah yeah okay uh
so the next quest the the next most
popular question uh
had to do with planetary clouds so uh my
question for i'm going to rephrase it
first before we go into it
are planetary clouds a vfx thing at all
at all
no well the the actual gen creation of
the clouds is not our not our domain
the work that we do similar to what i've
just said with sound distance fields i
guess the work that we do will come in
when
when those clouds the uh the kind of the
domain of the the core engineering team
really once
that side of things is is is there then
that's where we come in and we'll start
to care about
the actual the rain that comes from the
clouds the lightning and all them kind
of things and and
probably like the interaction of the of
the of the player
within that cloud as well that will
probably be something that that
certainly leo would
would be involved with i think but the
actual creation that the the
the physical creation of that cloud is
is not our domain
no gotcha so it it's like like like a
like a like
like props on a set dressing yeah
another team will create the
tech that develops everything and then
you guys will come in and dress it up
and make it look
exactly and make it look the way they
should all right yeah i mean
we're involved in the process like we we
collaborate with the people who are
actually implementing the tech so like
i've got good visibility on on what it
is that we're doing for it
but yeah we we don't actually make the
thing okay
well uh i i know it's a i know it's a
popular
hot button topic with the community as
we've seen in multiple question threads
so the what i can offer to the community
right now is that
uh when the appropriate time comes we
will have we will have a feature
on the creation of planetary clouds and
volunteer clouds and a lot of stuff
as soon as it's ready at a point that's
ready to talk about and
show you so i can't tell you when that's
going to be it's
when it's ready um moving on
uh we do have uh we do have a number of
weather effects in the game
uh today what can you tell us about
what's next
well yeah i mean so so it kind of does
depend on what we've just spoken about
with the clouds themselves
um we're obviously going to be anything
that you imagine
would be happening is going to happen so
we're going to have rain
we need to have that um one thing that
i'm more interested in
or more excited by is like more
localized types of weather so storms
tornadoes whirlwinds little dust devils
those kind of things
lots lots of that's the kind of that's
the kind of vfx that
that i kind of look forward to because
it it's the whole collaboration of the
whole team so it's
again it's like it's the vfx programmers
and it's the gameplay implications and
it's the visuals that we have to provide
to to show what the game you know show
those gameplay implications so the
player can see that
if they go towards a tornado uh
you probably shouldn't do but i'm sure
that people you know
would enjoy doing that in a game uh to
see that like the map the visuals match
what is going to happen to the actual
ship or the player if they're if they're
not in the ship
um but yeah like lightning storms as
well um snow
or just anything you can think of like
weather you know if you can think of it
as weather then
it's a pretty good guess that we're
going to be wanting to implement in it
in the game
when we get the the clowns i think i
tweeted at you
yesterday the day before that this
phenomenon that somebody was
photographing the
the weird i can't even
it was like a jellyfish in the sky if i
had seen it i would have thought i was
in some kind of stranger things
uh moment uh but apparently it's a real
thing that happens and i never knew
about it so
yeah um let's let's move to quantum uh
to quantum travel uh we got a lot of
questions about
uh about the the quantum travel effects
specifically um
while there are several variations of
that like when you fly a
at an alien ship you get a slightly
different quantum travel effect
the core qt effect has kind of been in
place for a while now
and some of our backers
uh indicated in the question thread that
uh that maybe it hasn't
aged as well as other things have
improved or that they're simply
tired of seeing the same effect uh for
the last uh for
the last while is there a possibility
for some kind of a dynamic generation in
those effects
something that can happen where on any
given time the effect would change or
be different based on how you've tweaked
the engine or
environmental effects or or basically
the quest the
all the questions combined into one sort
of like what are our thoughts about
changing the the standard quantum travel
effect
and providing some visual breakup for
for folks who quantum travel quite a lot
yeah so so for sure you kind of nailed
it there there's a
i think there's a bit of visual fatigue
that comes in when when it's one of the
earlier effects that people just see a
lot
like you know i've seen that quantum
travel effect a few times myself
um and yeah it it we use the term rot
like some some things rot over time it's
just
it's just that the tech the tech that's
driving the effects might have changed
so certainly with quantum travel
there have been fundamental changes to
the back end work like what is
what is the engine doing with with that
actual process of
quantum traveling which which does
change how the effects are behaving so
i won't say they're broken but they
definitely don't look like they used to
and
and um the timings get changed as well
so from a design point of view it's
really important that
um they care about like the spool of
time and they care about
all those kind of those kind of hooks
that we then use to drive the effects
so uh i get i guess what i'm saying is
we're we're aware that they are due
an update and that is that is planned
and scheduled and actually
our vfx concept art is rob he's i think
next week in fact i think that's his
next task he's going to be jumping onto
uh concept in the the quantum travel
we've got some really good
we've got some really good information
from people like
nate nate the squadron 42 art director
and hannes the cinematics director
so those guys have got a really clear
idea of what they want so
we're going to use that we're going to
we're going to feed that into our
concepts
to address your point about actual kind
of like
the diet more dynamic element of it and
variables and things changing
i think absolutely that that's something
that we we always look to do with our
effects we
i've talked in the past about emitter
strength so particles have like a
strength curve and that can we can
leo can can probably elaborate on this
but we can actually use that strength
curve to
to uh we can map that to other variables
so if you're
let's just say the quantum drive was
getting damaged we could actually
visually reflect that we could we could
show a much more chaotic looking effect
um so yeah there's all kinds of things
that we we could do with that and that
we we
would like to do as well there was also
some possibilities of using the sdf tech
um
when i was exploring the look of the
atmo entry
i also tried it with
what a qt effect might look like and
there's
a lot of possibilities and a lot of
really cool uh
dynamic um things we could do with it
absolutely yeah
okay for for like a tech point of view
um
it was a while ago like implemented the
qt
effects and one of the limitations we
have
right now is that the effects are set up
on the ships
so if you change your quantum drive
this the effects will remain the same
one of the things i'd like to do at some
point is
move that we don't have those
limitations anymore so
like with a few changes to the system in
the back end we could actually
implement uh per drive
effects rather than per ship effects
which i think is also one of the things
that
people have been mentioning so somebody
could take the
the quantum drive from like an alien
ship
like the scout has a very different
quantum effect and bring it over to
and bring it over to a miss ship or an
aegis ship and put it in there and
and get the change in effect kind of
thing if if design
like if the design of those content
drives allows that of course
yeah yeah that would like yeah something
something we'd like to pursue absolutely
yeah okay yeah
and as you like you mentioned the the
different styles as well
obviously the most the most common one
is the the default as we call it the
kind of the blue
the streaky blue one but yeah we've
we've got different we've
got different visual styles for
different uh alien
races so we can and we've we've always
talked about like having high and low
tech
variables as well so maybe a cheaper
drive
would would look different it's a bit
like you know putting it putting a nasty
old big exhaust pipe on you on your car
compared to something high-end you know
we we like to be able to reflect that
visually as well right
so this sounds like the first step
towards doing that is
is untying it from the ship and tying it
more to the
more to the actual quantum drive item
itself
um now that we can see other ships on
re-entry
uh what are your thoughts on meteor
showers
i'm gonna let it take this one take it
away to you
uh well i have tested this um
and it is on the vfx side obviously
completely possible
uh it would just depend on the design
requirements
um perhaps story element elements in
squadron
yeah things like that but it is on our
side it's possible
and it looks it looks pretty cool yeah
yeah i
imagine it's one of those things that's
easy to make it look cool from a
distance but then you have to figure out
the gameplay implications of
what if somebody goes to that meteor
shower and flies to that you know
now there's now there's it's more than
just looking cool now there has to be
gameplay implications to it yeah and
that's a much more complicated
conversation
yeah in a normal game you can use meteor
showers as like a backdrop but
for us we can actually like how do you
spawn a meteorite in the sky
like where does it come from will it
just like pop in existence or like i
know okay that's a great point it's that
that's that's the challenge there it's
like that thing's got to come from
somewhere at some point so
you know yeah where it can't be
is it hidden behind a is it in a gas
cloud is it hidden there's always
possibility that someone could be
at that place where the thing spawns so
yeah that's quite a unique challenge to
our game
npcs in in games have monster closets
dude
are there such things as meteor closets
where they can spawn and come and
it can come from and again they have to
be visible from like every angle because
you you can't control
where the player is going to be when
they see it so
yeah lots of interesting lots of
interesting challenges there but uh
if you want to see how it looks just get
a couple of friends to all come
come down more or less at the same time
at the same speed on a planet
and then you'll that that's kind of how
it'll look
cool um how do you guys anticipate the
switch to vulcan
will affect your work
well for me uh i mean again leo you can
probably provide a more technical
answer to this but for me in theory
aside from the fact that
there's kind of time out the schedule
for the programmers to to do their work
it won't really make a huge difference
to the likes of me and to
we won't we'll get like big performance
benefits
in the game from it so i guess we can
throw more particles
at things which is always a good thing
for me um but yeah it's not like going
to make a fundamental change to how we
work or anything like that
yeah for for me personally at least i
think it won't
make much of a big difference because
it's not really the code
i work in that much it's it's more simon
our leads who will be doing uh most of
the work there
but yeah it will be quite a big big
chunk of time to get it all working
and tested and um
yeah but yeah it's it's quite exciting
because i think
it will allow for some some more
particles and
better features and yeah
um it wouldn't be it wouldn't be a vfx
show without a question about gas clouds
so
uh mike where are we at with the gas
clouds uh
how they're coming along
they're coming along well i mean it is i
guess it's similar to the to the shields
topic that
it's it's long been talked about and
shown and the backers
you know are very patient backers will
have seen lots and lots of updates on
the cast clouds
uh it it's we still have weekly syncs
with all the people that are involved in
it
it's it's i would say it's going well
like um
earlier on with the gas cloud work it
was we were kind of more focused i guess
on squadron
in particular but we we've more recently
at least this year been
been discussing options with the pu team
as well so
you know there's there's lots of nice
looking gas clouds for the grange points
um the actual tech itself again that's
more of a graphics thing and that is
pretty much
the the tech itself the gas clouds
that's pretty much
all you know in a good state and and
looking pretty solid there's lots of
we've started to do a lot more through
testing
in terms of like let's get a gas cloud
in
in an area let's get loads of ships in
there let's have dog fights let's get
bigger ships in there and let's really
try and break this thing there's lots of
work that
comes from that just more boring stuff
but like bug fixes and lots
things that we didn't really anticipate
previously from
our point of view like the actual i
guess things like
the the different like the different
space loop effects that
we want to have themes to the gas class
so we want we want a designer to be able
to
take a gas card that the artist has made
and we want to be able to just
have that same gas cloud if you place it
five times in a row be able to change
all the properties so that it actually
looks and behaves in a different way and
the experience inside that
is different you know in each of those
variants of that of that same thing
so all those kind of loose ends that
we're trying to tie up i guess
we want to we want to we want to make
sure design
is as far ahead as they are so the whole
kind of thing sinks
and then that's when we're going to feel
confident about and putting it in there
and letting people
see it for themselves so much of what
you mentioned
uh especially what you do uh depends on
the
on the work of others like it is well
making a video game is a collaborative
effort
between multiple teams but with vfx uh
is absolutely no exception it's it's
you've got to work with the engine team
in order to give
get you the underlying tech you need
before you can you can color something
yeah if anything you do is going to be
emissive and a lot of the effects are
you got to work with the lighting team
to figure out how that's going to
you know dynamic lighting uh of course
if you want these things to actually
have knock-on effects
and stuff i i think there's actually a
question we'll get to this next one
about
about explosions actually being
physicalized in the
in the world and having knock-ons you
got then you got to get with gameplay
design
and stuff like that uh it's it's
definitely a collaborative uh
process um usually yeah well let's see
what we can do touching on that one
right there explosions
has there been any talk about making
explosions have
uh area of effect you know damage
yeah absolutely um the again i guess the
yeah the fits of the physics team and uh
i forget i forget the name but basically
of the team book like rich tyro you know
[Music]
yep yep so so there's a lot of work that
those guys have been doing and i'm sure
we've been showing it
and updating the backers about it
regarding like physical
physical reactions um like impulses so
yeah an explosion should should
if you're if you happen to be standing
say someone fires a grenade
like from a grenade launcher um i'm
looking at you too
and that explosion happens over there
absolutely it should it should knock the
player kind of sideways and stumble and
that that's all
kind of planned and a lot of that work
is very far ahead as well
uh they'll you guys they'll actually see
that
on isc in about two or three weeks
depending on
uh b-roll availability so right here
that's actually when it's going
um so yeah so that's you're talking
about force reactions and the ability
and the ability of transferring
uh those physics from the things that
create them onto the players
and yes yeah coming later this month
maybe at the beginning of next month it
all depends on when the visuals are
ready people
people are always like why don't you
talk about this or whatever that's like
we're waiting on the visuals
you want to see it don't you i don't
know what that voice was i did either
we're just gonna move on
uh let's let's let's let's go front
let's go to the live chat here for some
questions
uh uh right off the bat what special
effects have you had the most problems
with
what's been your big problem effect
oh god will someone else go like someone
what's been your el wapo what's been the
thing that's just driven you crazy
i mean i mean so
effects perhaps uh that have
been around in the environment mostly in
like lourville and area 18.
um i think for me but you you probably
sympathize with this tier but i think
for me one of the problem effects is as
smoke from a barrel of a gun which
sounds like a really simple thing to do
but that
that's really really tricky to get
looking good um
two reasons is the the lighting model of
our particle system at the moment
is it's not it's not fully pbr so it's
not it's not quite
like accurate in real world terms so
again with our game you can make you
have to make sure that your effect looks
right on
in daylight you have to make sure it
looks right at night time
up in space where the you know the glare
of the sun is intense
so what we end up doing is with it you
want a kind of a nice subtle
smoke emission from the barrel and you
always get this from from the art and
designers
working on weapons i can you know could
you just get a little bit of smoke about
the barrel
and the problem is that you you do that
and it looks great but then you see
someone firing it in space and it's
super bright it's like oh god
it looks really bad so now i've got to
tone it right down and then i've turned
it right down
so then i get people saying i can't see
any smoke coming out i'm gone
so it's really tricky in that sense and
also another another
side of that i'm sorry if this is i
don't know if this is boring or
interesting but
another one is is the fact that you can
move around really quickly so you have
to have this
like the particle count obviously we
can't
we can't spawn too many particles even
with the gpu system we can't spawn too
many
so you get this problem where the barrel
if the smoke is emitting from the gun
while the player's moving it around
you just get these little blobs like
smoke and that that kind of breaks the
immersion that doesn't really look good
so just a kind of really minor type of
effect i guess in the scheme of things
but that's that's a really tricky one
that always causes me headaches
yeah leo um
well the past year i think like
atmospheric country has been
kind of a headache as well um just in
the sense that
we have some trouble of like figuring
out when to
spawn the effects
our ships don't really fly fast enough
to
physically uh or physic
physically accurately um spawn
like spawn the effect when when it
shoots like in real life
um so we have to kind of fake it because
it's a really cool effect
um but yeah it's it's kind of
um we've had a lot of back and forth
between different teams but how what we
can do
to change or like change the experience
or change
the the calculations is it's yeah for me
it's
i guess a bit more of a technical point
of view not
really like visual but yeah
john crew you can send your letters to
leo care of
that impairment games uk manchester
um
you spoke of uh you spoke at the reentry
effects uh one of the questions we got
here
uh when we were showing the development
of
of that on the sprint report at one
point there was a
hull shader that that would would make
the hull a heat shader for the hole that
would make the
hull glow if you were doing a bad
atmospheric reentry
uh is that happening still is that off
the table
what happened to that was that just r d
well before you answer uh i i wasn't
going to mention it but one of the
things that
is difficult based on the previous
answer is uh
putting the making sure the effects
the the reason for the effect is
understood and
and seen and on the atmospheric entry
effect um deadline and i worked on
yeah that that glow is a is a big part
of that
you leaving it for me to answer then
yeah yeah
well i mean it is still planned that
that's the short answer it's it's not
we certainly we we sort of are indeed it
and we showed it
uh it's we haven't taken it off the
table we're definitely
planning on on doing it um when when we
can the issue there is the
again it's i'm probably just going to be
repeating myself a lot but
it's the collaboration it's not
something that we as a vfx team can
implement
that needs to be uh we need to get like
time from the graphics
team so ali and ali and his his team um
to actually work on the shader itself
we then need to collaborate with with
the ship people so you mentioned your
own crew so john john's been in
conversations about this
it's just getting everyone together at
the same time to be able to
you know make sure that all priorities
are aligned
to actually be able to do that so
definitely still planned
um i can't commit to when yeah but
it's certainly on the table and we're
also going to be needing something
similar for
uh for the fire propagation as well yeah
now
priorities can be the easy answer to
almost
every one question uh with regards to
video game development
it's just a question of is yes it's it's
always a question
in the simplest forms yeah we don't we
always like to do it we'd always love to
do it we'd always love to pursue it
it's just a question of with everything
else that we're trying to do and even
with
as many folks as we have and as many
studios around the world there are still
a finite number of resources
so you have to always direct your
efforts towards the things
that you know any given individual can
work on uh it's
so yeah priorities are often the course
there um
it will be needed for the fire
propagation stuff
yeah yeah yeah so the reason why it
didn't really work was that we have to
glow on the ship itself
with the damage map so if you shoot the
ship um
you you get like the glowy glowing parts
so we could use that for for making the
ship glow but
all the items attached such as the
landing gear
the uh the glass the uh
doors even they didn't glow with it
and it's basically we need the same kind
of glow tech
on all those other
um objects um and
so one of the things we're requesting
now from the graphics theme is this
is kind of like a more generic glow
shader so that we can
use that same shader on the material
for fire so if an object is hot enough
for it to glow then we can use that same
kind of
system to to make an object glow um
so it's going to be yeah probably a
while but
it's it's going to be like something
used for different
different systems as well which is which
is nice
so you brought up fire propagation so we
let's
let's get into that we've been
showcasing that on our our bi-weekly
sprint reports for some time now
i personally find it very very
interesting which is why i include it
and then luckily the
the community has agreed um why is
the entity to voxel propagation
important
and necessary and uh
beyond that what are the next steps like
when do we start
updating the fire effect itself and uh
and then the question actually came from
the chat was will it
change color based on fuel like
basically how far do we intend to take
this let's just make it
a simple question and go from there
all right so we prepared a little demo
for the fire propagation so i can go
through the demo
um and answer some questions a lot of
the questions
yeah yeah you wanna do a screen share
yep can you see my screen we can see
your screen
all right so uh we got everyone's
favorite ship
sexually die maybe not but
we're going to set it on fire john crew
you can send your letters to
leo cloud appearing games uk
winslow go ahead so
uh we are going to base our fire on
voxels so you can see the square um i
can put a debug
um like this i don't know if like you
can see
the green edges but like those are all
voxels
with material properties
um so in those voxels we are kind of
going to bake the environment and in the
environment
we have material properties so for
example
plastic the material properties this is
all
prototype work so nothing is final a lot
of
tweaking and balancing and setup still
needs to be done
for all of this to kind of be
implemented but
for now this for example says plastic so
in plastic we have all of these
properties which will affect fire
um and here we have wood stands and
plastic combined
for example here we have a fabric as
well so all of these have these
these kind of properties they're
physically based
so we're going to start with a
physically based
propagation system and see how far we
can
get with that and then we have an entity
as well
so what's the difference between an
entity
and a voxel basically a lot
of environments in our game aesthetic
it will never move and we have a lot of
those kind of static
objects and it's mainly for performance
reasons
we can't keep track of the fire state
in all of those objects for example here
in this voxel we have all of these these
dirty pillow
pillows they like we can't really set
each
[Laughter]
set the dirty pillows on fire leo yeah
we can't
set them all separately on fire so so we
kind of
average out all of these properties
inside of axle
um so for example if i change the
physics so i set the physics on you'll
see that this tool
was falling because it's a dynamic
entity and it can move in game
uh while the the blend box it will
remain
hovering over the table while it's just
static it does have
like static physics but it doesn't have
any dynamic physics or anything so
we can be sure it will always be in the
same
place
[Music]
so we can set these voxels on fire
um and we have different effects as well
so um if i set this voxel on fire
we'll have um the kind of generic
effect that most properties will have
more most materials will have but we can
also for example this one has
a fabric which is a different
material and a different effect as well
so
we'll have a more kind of low effect
uh compared to the high flames from the
generic one
and these are work in progress so i i'm
still
working on them and they'll they'll look
more distinct
than that yeah yeah definitely so all
the visuals yours
visuals you see here they are temporary
for the prototype
um they're definitely not fine
final uh we also got like
um this one uh that's the vegetation
i don't know if it's very well visible
with with the quality of teams but
this one has like uh ash
things floating uh up up the flames
so you can kind of can see like the the
ash
um so all of these you can also do uh
electrical fires and whatever and in the
meantime you see that this fire is kind
of
getting out of control spreading around
it's spreading around
we also have a fog volume so
you see that the the the room is getting
a bit foggy because of all the smoke
being released by the fire um
this is something we'll also add so this
will be based on the
uh atmosphere of your room um
your um so if there's lots of smoke or
toxic gases your your room will start
fogging up to to kind of add to the
visuals
i'll reset this to
kind of make it
doable again so how do we
propagate so we got some very quite
fast uh propagation here in this area
we have a few few
[Music]
ways of propagating the fire so the
first one
is let's go for radiation uh radiation
is basically your objects
shoots ray of energy kind of things
to nearby nearby objects so it will kind
of heat up
by radiation this is
not the most effective way of heating
up an object but it's
kind of simulated anyway
think uh infrared uh but and not nuclear
radiation right right yes exactly yeah
good point
different way i think we also have
convection
um and this is basically the way
um so you heat up the air and the air
starts kind of moving around in your
room
we won't do like full fluid simulation
for this
but we will try and um add in gravity in
there
so that if you have a low gravity then
the
convection won't be as strong while if
you have a
high gravity then there will be more and
more convection we'll also try to
muddle in the wind so that the wind
direction of your
your fire affects
the the
propagation propagation indeed yeah this
is important actually for visuals sorry
to cut you off there
because the particles will follow forces
like wind and gravity
um so you would expect flames going up
a wall for example to then have more
more of those voxels above it to catch
fire
yes for example if we set a voxel on
fire near
a wall if i can find one then there
there should be more propagation upwards
rather than
um around it
and the last type of propagation is
damaged
so if we heat up an object and this will
be based on the material type as well so
it will
not all material types
will do this kind of behavior but
it is possible for that object to
have a chance to ignite when it receives
damage
and this kind of allows us to
to model a more random fire
behavior while the convection and the
radiation is really it's
deterministic it's always the same it
will go
up with gravity with certain wind
direction uh the radiation is always
like based on the strength it will
always go
like just around um
so the damage gives a little bit of
randomness
and then uh was one more thing i wanted
to show here
so with the
entities and voxels so for example if i
set this voxel on fire
and i move this this brush to static
brush
the fire doesn't move because everything
is baked into this
voxel while if i set this
dynamic entity on fire
we can move it and
it will the fire will move with it and
what this means
is that you can kind of set fire around
here
just because this tool is on fire i
never get tired of seeing this
it's it's really cool to play around
with to be honest yeah
that is very cool leo
thank you for taking the time to show
this i've got some more
if we have time uh sure
which what you got a rolling barrel
uh keeping the best for lost
uh if we ignite it and we enable physics
the barrel will start rolling
and we can keep track oh this is like a
made in britain extinguisher
so if we track this voxel
uh then we
see that we can track the temperature of
this this voxel
and if it goes be above the yellow line
it will go into the smoke temperature so
it will start
smoking and that means that the voxel
can also
start to catch on fire so in here you
see this
yeah just like it spiked up that's
because it went into the fire range
uh of the temperature and this foxel
column fire basically
and we have this for all these voxels
around it so the the temperature will
go up they will start smoking and when
is this
important it's going to be important if
we want to start
extinguishing so our extinguisher
it's yeah not working
very well but we got a debug
extinguishing feature which we can use
let's speed this up a little bit so i
can speed up the propagation
this is fine a lot this is fine this is
fine
um and then i can start extinguishing
and hopefully we'll see the fire to die
down
where i extinguish so basically what you
need to do is is make sure that
there is no more smoke anywhere um
okay maybe this was a bit too much
you can reset it
[Laughter]
well we finally answered the age-old
question from billy joel
it was leo
[Music]
yeah so extinguishing works in a few
different ways as well
so we um because we go physically based
we can kind of um
use the fire triangle triangle
which is used for by firefighters uh
basically
if you take away one of the oxygen fuel
or or the other
it's fuel oxygen and
willpower what
uh temperatures heat i think
it's it's temperature it's fuel and it's
materials i think
i think the materials are kind of fuel
isn't it yeah
let me quickly blocking out here
uh fuel heat and
oxygen so
basically what we do is we we take away
the heat
inside this um inside this sphere
that you see here there's this debug
sphere we also take away the oxygen so
that the
the fire kind of dies down and then we
by taking away the heat
we are able to kind of make the
temperature
go below the um
smoke temperature and that will make
sure it won't be able to
kind of reignite and catch on fire
we also track fuel so if the if that
specific
voxel or object doesn't have any mass
anymore to burn it will die down on its
own
and of course like later down the line
if we kind of decompress a ship
then your fire will be gone as well
so yeah i guess this is my
demo completely running out of control
but thank you so much house designed
yeah yeah
you yeah you can stop the screen share
thank you
um thank you leo uh
oh wait where's my picture there we go
uh people saw the wonderful outside of
the apartment there
uh for a few seconds um that's great uh
one of the follow-up questions that i
know folks a lot of
a lot of folks had in the chat there
have you
have you considered zero g and how any
of this is going to work in zero g
we're all not in yeah
for i explained a little bit that
convection
will it will play into convection which
is
the only way zero g will affect fire and
propagation but to will explain a little
bit
but officials i guess yeah i mean
in terms of propagation it makes sense
right zero g there's there's no
um there's nothing pushing the fire up
or sideways with wind or anything like
that
so it radiates uh
everything the the difficulty with zero
g
fire is the visuals obviously because
gases behave differently in zero gravity
um
so it's it's something
i think about a lot um keeps you up at
night
keeps me up at night and it's um
yeah it's next on the list for me to uh
take a look at
along with um different uh
visual styles for surface types for
different types of fuel
that kind of plays into it almost
because it it it might
it might need its own uh look
right yeah now fire and zero g it tends
to be
uh from the reference i've seen like
almost
yeah globulous yeah it's weird yeah
it's it's very weird so we can do that
but then would that look
cool and would that you know is that
what we expect right
yeah like with all things you take it to
the point of realism
then you bring it back to the point of
fun
uh let's see all right we've got 15
minutes left
what else we got missile effects
mike are you happy with the current
missile effects
because they kind of seem like crap i'm
not i'm not happy
with no i'm not happy with them and i
intend to improve them
um i'm actually i'm actually working on
them myself at the moment
um sort of i guess in between official
duties i i'm
trying to tweaking the effects and i
probably i think i've shown in
in a couple of the update meetings that
i've already got some
improvements to them just things like
making them making them last longer so
increasing the life and that helps
readability
um just making making the flares more
visible from a distance pushing out the
actual thrust
effects themselves just kind of minor
tweaks again similar i guess
similar to the quantum travel
conversation it's a much
the missile trails are a much older
effect um
possibly some of the first i i worked on
back in the day but yeah long story
short definitely planning on
improving them already made some work on
it we're also we're also holding out for
some
some graphics from sorry some vfx
particle system
improvements as well inc like for
ribbons on the gpu system for example
which will allow us to to get
kind of a bit more efficient with the
trails as well so yeah going to improve
them
definitely and those will go along uh
other improvements to missiles in
general being worked on by like the
vehicle experience team
and stuff because missiles in general
are
are are coming due for a uh for
an overhaul and you'll of course be
hearing more about that
uh as it continues on um
somebody was asking where's pico he's
right here
i think it'd be flammable this we're not
going to find out
this is the only one in existence this
was the manufacturer prototype this is
literally the only one that
is out in the world right now so we're
not we're not going to find out if it's
viable i need some reference
uh but not going to get it you're not
going to get it uh
let's see what else do we got here um
we've seen what looks like cherry
blossom trees in oregon does the thought
of them dropping leaves excite or
terrify you
for me both yeah it's terrifying in the
sense that it's
it's like more more dynamic effects um
but it's exciting because that's a real
nice having having
leaves falling from a tree and getting
blown around by the wind and
uh ian the the uh art director kind of
he wants origin to have that kind of
feel to it like a
sort of a gentle breeze so uh yeah i
mean it's exciting actually i'm only
really joking when i say it's terrifying
um but i seem to vaguely remember i
think i
i think i half jokingly said to chris in
one of the updates that if we knew the
amount of leaves on a tree we could
actually
directly leo's laughing already but we
could we could directly
drive like the amount of leaf particles
that fall from the tree
but i mean and that's why we call you
part of the problem mike
it's an option it's there you know but
but then geometry as well so
yeah yeah yeah but then you know someone
all the
all the leaves would have to grow back
otherwise we just end up with no leaves
on the trees
at some point in the in the game so it's
probably not really not the best idea
so maybe we can do seasons as well yeah
well
yeah yeah yeah in future
in a tbd to be determined uh patch
yeah uh right along with missile effects
let's move on to thruster effects
um
same kind of question i guess yeah i
mean the answer is the same
like i mean thruster effects is thruster
effects were the things i was most
passionate about
for for a while when i joined cig
because i absolutely loved the
thing about vfx is like it's quite in
the old days of being a vfx artist
there was this conception and it was the
case uh in in sort of more
earlier games the vfx just made a pretty
looking effect like
a flame and they just placed it in the
level
or or it came from a weapon as you just
saw with leo's
leo's demonstration of fire propagation
there's a hell of a lot of data that
drives the effects
these days um thrusters always i i
really like the thrusters because it was
a similar kind of thing it was it was
fairly simple it was like the the thrust
input so the actual value
from the ship was driving the the
strength curve of the particle so you
could do some really nice things with it
um it's progressed over time so we as
well as thrust input and
and leo you know was was very much
involved in in the functionality side of
this
we got overheating we've got damage
we've got misfires we've got we've got
boost we've got shock diamonds when
you're in atmosphere
that you know you don't you don't see
them when when you're not in atmosphere
there's a lot of ships in our game as as
well you know so
there's a lot of thrusters that need to
get made we're constantly improving the
gpu particle system
so so naturally some of the older
effects
don't look as good as other ones we've
actually just finished
work on the 100 ice clusters yeah and
we just showed that yeah yeah so we just
showed that in the
in in a pu update and uh i'm having fun
about an internal update guys yes sorry
an internal team update
um chris loved him like an ian ian
commented as well like he thought they
were the best ones we've done so
i was really happy for jacob the the the
artist who made them
so yeah it's just one of them things
where we got so many moving parts
we we you know can't really press the
pause button
on on the machine that you know the
beast that is star citizen
um so we just got to try and keep up and
we just need to find a bit of time to
just look at all of the effects
uh kind of collectively and just and
just work on improvements that we can
do across the board i have been doing
that again similar to with the missiles
i have been working on the gladius
duster effects it's my favorite ship
obviously it's important for squadron
42.
so i've been looking at what do i need
to do to make the gladius effects tick
all the boxes
uh that chris has got really really
clear ideas on on how
how they need to be improved like
general visibility maneuvering thrusters
in particular i know that i know that's
a common
thing that comes up like maneuvering
thrusters are a bit too small you can't
see them
we've maybe been a bit too aggressive
with the with the with the loading of
them
so with lots of work is being done with
that i'm personally involved so
um yeah make them better we'll try
and for the folks asking yes you will
see them when the time is
right time is right um with things like
weather and temperature affecting more
and more things planetside have there
been any consideration for things like
heatwave or
or shimmer effects yes
the house is something like that we used
to have them exactly jared yeah yeah we
used to have them on the cpu particle
system
um and again we moved across
we've moved more of our planet effects
well all of our planet effects to the
gpu
but we didn't have refraction so there
so a refraction particle getting that
heat wave look
wasn't available to us um so once we get
that on the gpu
then yeah we can put the the shimmer
back in yeah
okay um one of the most common questions
that we get
and maybe put you on the spot a little
bit here
uh space dust have you considered the
option of
letting people just check a box and
remove it
some people don't like it some i like it
but some people don't
yeah i see that a lot and i understand
that that it's not to everyone's taste
uh we're not planning on removing it
just because
um well it's it physically exists in in
our
in our space in our game it is
physically there it's not it's not an ar
thing because i know there's been
conversations about oh hang on
what is the purpose of the space dust i
know that it's primarily to to make it
feel like
you can you can see that you're moving
basically it gives you that parallax you
take the space just out you you've got
no kind of sense of that you're moving
and i know that there'll be yeah i know
there'll be some some people
want the more realism side of it that
they don't care that they can't see
any kind of visual cue there's been talk
of putting it onto an ar so it's
it's a deliberately artificial space
dust kind of thing that helps with that
we did some tests quite a while ago on
that sort of thing
chris chris is quite keen on keeping the
space dust in
uh one thing i will say is again
something that i've been doing
personally i've been i've been tweaking
the values
so again it's it's quite uh not the most
glamorous of effects but
i've just been looking at maybe not
making the streaks quite as big maybe
reducing the amount increasing the
amount depending on on the location so
really just chipping away at that and
just trying to make them not too
intrusive
but but so that you still get the
benefit of getting that motion
graphic designers are known to suffer
from
word blindness when looking at for at
the same words over and over again
during visual design uh does the same
thing happen for visual effects
to you tell us um
yes so um
for me it's not so much obviously
text or anything like that it's more
motion and intensity so
a good example is when i'm working on
the fire effects
um and tweaking values with you know
with different strengths on the actual
fire effect
um after like about an hour
it's it's hard for me to distinguish
between the
the changes i'm making and that just is
because i'm
um it's it's like when you're sitting in
the back of a car that's moving for a
long time
and then you stop and then your your
vision con continues
to to to make you feel like you're
you're moving um
that happens definitely to me a lot uh
yeah so it's important to take breaks
uh work on another type of effect even
or something completely different
and then come back to it otherwise you
just waste time making changes that
don't make any sense
i think that's where your colleagues
come in useful as well you know it's
nice to
nice to show an effect that you've been
staring at for so long and you actually
i might give tio some feedback or he
might give me some feedback
oh no leo anyone in the team will will
go they'll point things out that you've
just become
blind to because again you're just
looking at so long
yeah yeah that happens in just about
every aspect of
game development that'll even happen in
yeah video stuff
you know it's by the way by time yeah by
the time isd segments go out to the
public i've
i've seen each one at least two dozen
times in a variety of different states
and and everyone we'll we'll finally you
know bring it out and branch it to other
people and they'll be like
why is this thing there i'm like what
are you talking about there's this giant
like ugly ass square thing in the middle
of the scene right here and it's like
oh i've looked at that footage so many
times and for so long
i was completely oblivious to it uh yeah
we'll go ahead
we'll recapture that i didn't realize i
didn't say so yeah so
so uh uh contact repetitiveness
blindness is something that affects uh
anything when you just work on it over
and over and over
for a prolonged period of time um
two to two final question before we wrap
up here um
how do you balance vfx needs versus game
performance
oh well that's a good one i mean
yeah well we've just got it we've got to
make it work you know so
so the the fire is probably a good
example of that
ground ground storms was another example
we know
we got a clear brief on what it is we
need to do and it just so happens that
the fire is gonna
you know that that that's very easily
gonna be a performance breaker
so we need to look at people smart
people like leo help us out here
uh and simon yeah you do leo
um you know we need to look at we we
need to make sure that they are
performing i mean this is
this is a game development
uh core value core principle for
everyone in every department
you've got to be able to make sure that
it runs in frame it's got to be
optimal and maybe you make some
compromises for that but you've got to
make sure that the compromises aren't
answer the detriment of the
of the visual quality
and uh oh go good you want to add no i
was going to say
this makes a big difference to to me
when working on
impact effects for example i could
visually i could throw
it uh tons and tons of particles with
smoke and
like make it really look cool when a
mass driver hits snow
which uh i i've prototyped before
and worked on but uh you do feel that
lag
come in when you have an impact or fire
weapon and that's just
that's just a no-no for me i it drives
me crazy
uh when i'm playing you know any other
game so
it's it's something i will put with
performance i put performance before
visuals
um yeah and trying to get get as much
visuals
out of the performance yeah it's worth
it's worth noting that in that fire demo
that we saw uh today and then in all the
footage we've seen in previous ones that
is a very
wip effect for the fire itself yeah it
is you know
the work right now is on the tech and
making sure the tech is lean
and mean and functions away and then
once all that's done
somebody will go in and start working on
the actual fire effect itself and
yeah for sure i mean it's like simon and
leo did great things
with the with the ground storms by the
way like they that's a that was a huge
undertaking there's a lot of effects
going on on the screen
and they the performance is actually
really good of that
given what they're doing the performance
is actually really good on them
um so yeah yeah tia is absolutely right
like we've got to make sure that the
gameplay experience is is
is kind of top priority there uh final
question before we let you go
uh fireworks in space really
yes yes really
um i mean yeah it's
you know do we do we need to justify it
with some
with some lore 930 years worth of
advanced technology
yeah yeah yeah leo's got got some
thoughts on this i'm sure
yeah it's uh called space fireworks yeah
just like just like oh there's space
fireworks
say no more so you know i didn't realize
they were space fireworks
now it all makes sense exactly yeah i
just needed that clarification
i'm sure that's put an end to that
argument
all right uh thank you so much guys for
taking time out of the end of your week
to be here on the show
i think folks really appreciate it i i
know i did
um as we are want to do at the end of
every seo now we are gonna throw
a we're gonna throw a raid over to a
star citizen streamer
uh that is uh hopefully broadcasting
right now uh i haven't heard for certain
but we're gonna find out
uh this is a french uh streamer named uh
you know i'm not good at pronouncing
these things i've been calling teo tio
this entire time
i said wimslow instead of wilmslow as
luke presley once corrected me on
i'm terrible at the pronunciation but
we're gonna try water pat
i think if i've got that correct uh she
is a french streamer
uh who does a lot of flight instruction
and stuff especially with the new flight
model in 310
so um so when you go over there and
and the raid happens uh say hi from the
vfx team
and uh yeah we'll see you back here next
week everybody so take care
uh thank you teo tayo
leo mike this is i'm jared
end the show thank you
you
