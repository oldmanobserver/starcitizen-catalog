it's not like we didn't know you you
guys needed this information
we wanted to show off a lot of this like
right from the get-go
we just never had the resources uh to to
change that flash ui
we basically had our hands tied
we were happy with it at the beginning
the problem is that
everything that was iterated on
throughout the course of the mining
systems being developed was not always
being conveyed back
in time to the original setups that we
had so
we we knew for example that we were
adding volatile cargo
and consumables and yet what that
actually ended up resulting in was that
a lot of the backers were sort of
theorycrafting a lot of this stuff to
try and figure out what exactly was they
were dealing with
players couldn't even see what was
directly in their cargo holds which we
felt was
something that we could also amend we
change it now to building blocks which
is
so much easier first of all a lot
cleaner and a lot easier to read it's
going to react a lot better with like
higher brightness conditions and every
other designer can
learn to use it and just go ahead and
make tweaks and changes to it
so in 312 we're gonna get this new
streamlined ui
the flight ui for example we felt that
we could provide at least some of the
flight ui information
such as your throttle speed and your
current velocity
which means that there'll be no nasty
surprises like i'm
in decoupled mode and i don't realize it
and i'm drifting and i don't know why
anything else that was catching players
out such as accidentally flying into the
ground when trying to manage deposits so
uh we felt that was kind of helpful to
have besides this one
we added now the functionality where you
can see which consumables you have
equipped on your ship
at the quick glance you see icons for
them you see which ones are active
at this moment how long they have before
they expire how long they will take
what's the cooldown
so you get to see all this information
you don't just have to
imagine how it works and hope that it
does like you imagine it
in addition to that we also felt that
the readability of what you were
actually mining was
not 100 where it could be we had the
cargo hold um element in there which
originally was just an scu readout and
the progress bar of
zero to 100 and what we
ended up feeling would be beneficial to
the players to be able to see what's
actually in the cargo hull
so we have now a new component in the ui
that not only
shows you what is in there but actually
up based in real time
again very similar to this we added the
functionality of viewing whether
something is volatile and whether
there's a danger
and this is one of the things that we
weren't really showing off properly in
the ui and we
we now are so volatile cargo in your
cargo hull component will be highlighted
in red
so that you really see that you've got
that in your cargo hold at any point
beneath that is a volatile cargo display
which will show you the egg the exact
percentage of health
from zero to 100 as well as the eta
on the time it will collapse and the
timer will come down again in real time
i will update whenever you take a bomb
as well
and then finally another thing that we
added to this was the
uh the there's actually a jettison
message as well which we were properly
we're now properly conveying that your
cargo has been jettisoned
when the json cargo button has been
pressed
we hope this will sort of alleviate a
lot of the confusion that the backers
were experiencing
they don't have to go through a hustle
they don't it should not be a struggle
for them to understand
what's happening in the mining process
and we're hoping that it will mean that
players have a better time with the
mining system in general that they will
get more out of it make more money out
of it and just generally have more fun
with it
there's a lot of exciting ui work coming
this quarter beginning with the revamped
mining and cargo interfaces we just
showed you
the refinery deck interface is coming
online towards the end of the quarter
and an overhaul to the long-awaited
manufacturer-based ship huds
that will start showing you next week
but before we get to that
let's go ahead and check in on some of
the smaller updates from teams around
the world
in this week's sprint report always
looking for ways to optimize and improve
performance
the lighting team is going back and
taking a look at some of the versus
older ships
in an effort to reduce the resource cost
of lighting within their cockpits
and doing so all while maintaining or
even improving the overall visual look
they do this by applying many of the
lessons the team has learned throughout
star citizen's continuing development
and once things
are more performative and their looks
are brought up to current standards
the team will then begin additional work
on integrating the lights from
individual button presses in the
upcoming fully physicalized dashboards
as well as updating the transition
effects between different power states
like from the auxiliary to the fully
empowered
overall it can be very easy to get
carried away when lighting an asset or
location
and unnecessarily blow past your
resource budget
which is why the team is also going back
to one of the most
immoderate resource hogs among all ships
in the origin 600i
now it didn't take long after applying
recent techniques
for artists to reduce the 600i's
lighting resource footprint
by a factor of 10 which then allowed for
the addition of new runtime probes
throughout the ship
meaning all those open areas will now be
properly affected by
and reflective of the universe around
them
the weapons concept team have finished a
sprint on developing new
non-lethal ordinance for star citizen
and squadron 42
including this taser-like stun gun from
preacher armaments
where you can see how the side panels
would expand out before discharging its
electron payload
as well as the upcoming cure life med
gun an
up close and personal beam weapon that
utilizes a cartridge of healing serum
to treat both npc and players alike
following up on the new volatile cargo
ui features we discussed earlier in the
show
the props team have been working on
three new styles of valuable
yet quite dangerous cargo items for
future gameplay
including damage sensitive items you
should probably carry
very carefully time sensitive items
meaning you
have to get them where they're going as
quickly as possible
and then a new quantum sensitive cargo
item
that means you're probably going to want
to keep a low profile
and maybe you know take the long way
around
meanwhile the vfx team have been working
on updated chaff effects to go along
with recent code
changes that are all a part of the
in-progress revamp to missiles
we'll talk about later in the quarter
now this work in progress
visual exploration will continue to
evolve as we test more
sparkly elements and continue to dial in
the approach we want to take
while simultaneously working to separate
its look visually
from the also in development flat cannon
weapons for
capital ships and space stations
of course it's been a while since we've
checked in on the team's work in fire
propagation
and well they might be having a little
too much fun at the moment
what you're seeing here is what's called
the visual target test
and this is separate from the code work
that we've shown in the past
the purpose here is to see what's
possible visually with the current
shader and graphics tech
that's already in place this looks
pretty good
but more importantly it's allowed the
team to identify areas of much-wanted
improvement that's still needed
like the glow and emissives from heated
surfaces the quality and density of soot
in the air
a more varied mix of flame types based
on the surface the fire is emitting from
and more in locations news
artists that recently finished their
work on cargo decks have begun to move
over to 3.12's upcoming refinery deck
add-ons for space stations
as they further explore the visual style
here it was decided to introduce more
soft body elements where appropriate
seen here
in early roughs on some of the pipe
systems and insulation materials
you can expect us to follow along with
the continuing progress of refinery
decks
throughout the remainder of this quarter
artists have also taken a pass at some
of the existing derelicts in-game
like this starfarer crash to update the
look more in line with what we might
expect
from a long damaged and abandoned
vehicle a smaller tasks like these are
usually reserved for the downtime that
can sometimes occur at the end of
sprints
or when other scheduled work is
temporarily blocked by
technical or resource issues overall
it's a great way to keep artists engaged
while simultaneously working down the
smaller tech debt issues
that can often build up in a team's
backlog
finally in ship the station docking news
with the concept we last showed you now
approved
designers have begun the process of
white boxing the actual locations
where these arms and collars and docking
hubs will go
on the existing space stations now the
easiest thing to do would probably be to
stick these things out at the farthest
reaches of the stations
but there was a feeling here that that
would make the stations feel too
disconnected and spread out
and we were very keen to create as many
dynamic views as possible for those
within the stations
of the massive ships outside while also
minimizing the amount of
downtime foot travel the players would
have to make if we just
set the hangers at those farthest
reaches what you're seeing here is by no
means their final placements
but as stated explorations of potential
options
that must now be weighed by the various
teams for their relative benefits
and detriments one thing's for certain
ship to station docking is on its way to
the star citizen precision universe
and it looks like the wait is going to
be worth it
so what did we learn about this week
well we learned that building blocks
continues to make addressing the
feedback and considerations of players
easier and more effective for designers
and programmers alike
that it's never too late to go back and
optimize or improve on the things that
have come before
and that the vfx team isn't going to be
happy until the entire universe is on
fire
this is fine for inside star citizen i'm
jared huckaby we'll see you next week
