## Transcript

hi everybody
uh welcome to another episode of star
citizen live
builds publishes and platforms or what's
it platforms and publishers who knows
i'm your host jared huckabee and joining
us on the show this week
are a round table of incredibly
technical director type folks who are
involved in
making bringing all the aspects of star
citizen that all of our wonderful
developers
create over the course of the days and
the months and weeks and
bring them together into builds and
publishes and and make them accessible
to you the players so
we are stepping back behind the scenes
here and we are joined by well a couple
people let's just go around the room
and uh see who we're talking to miles
i think it's been the you've been the
longest since you've been on one of our
shows we're going to start with you
first
uh who are you what do you do for star
citizen
i'm the director of build operations i
manage the team
which uh deals with the version control
mostly
and build system creating the builds
that we deliver out to the players
okay uh ahmed we'll go to you next who
are you and what do you do for star
citizen
uh am ahmad checker i've been with cig
for five years and a half
my team and i were publishing technology
we received the build once it comes out
from the build system and we try to
deliver it to every single player
whether internally externally
leveraging a lot of cloud technologies
automation and
some good old-school also system
management and system engineering about
how to keep
all these moving parts together to
deliver like a good player experience
at the same time to harvest as much
debug information and
because we're in active development so
it's kind of very unique
kind of role we're not just serving a
live product we're also
yeah yeah all right uh and then there's
benoit
so on the show today benoit
who are you what do you do uh you need
to say my last name first
[Laughter]
bo ah so good actually
you
i know you did cool um uh i'm ben
i'm the cto at turbulent uh so i manage
and oversee all of the teams that make
platform services and so that includes
website
launcher and a couple of in-game
services as well
so so yeah so that means taking miles is
built that goes through ahmed systems
and uh getting that into your heads
not just so i imagine the three of you
uh work pretty closely throughout
throughout the the month week day i
don't know
well yeah how many bills a day
i'm at sometimes a lot a lot
i mean that's that's the good thing we
we we deploy a lot of builds behind the
scenes that we get to decide what they
can make here or not
so not all the builds that we deploy you
will get to see right
sometimes there's so many yeah yeah not
every build even makes it to the point
where it can deploy
so yeah some of the some of the builds
are uh
yeah so let's talk about that before we
get into the question and answer period
uh which is you know what most of the
show is this is a bit of a
uh esoteric show it's different than we
normally do
um most most of the time uh when people
look at the stuff that
you know other games put out you know
they're buying this and stuff we're
never talking about
build systems and publishing and
platform stuff so
so we're in an area that that a lot of
folks may not be familiar with so let's
talk about
uh how a how a build becomes a law
that was school ass rock nevermind uh
let's begin by to do an overview how
does the the build and publish process
work
so i mean it obviously starts with the
developer committing a change
once that goes through that process we
get uh we have tools which allow the
developers to kick builds
from our release streams uh
once the build is finished we go through
a manifest process
and we create what we call the build
manifest and basically it's just the
list of files that
dictates what the launcher should patch
down and
we upload that and kind of hand off the
comment from there
yeah that's that's where the custody
kind of switches from a team to another
but also we do not really really have
silos like all these teams
actually work together for so many years
so it can be that we can
actually be following up on the building
and build system and trying to inspire
what could be wrong and you could be
also looking at deployment and see what
could have gone wrong
so from from that moment that we have a
build we have a manifest it depends on
the size of the deployment
every deployment is going to go to in a
single region a small number of audience
a key or a staging deployment this is
fully automated you go through a web
interface you click deploy everything
gets created from scratch
share nothing like vms get created
a kubernetes deployment for a new
generation of services name space gets
created a helm deployment chart gets
initiated that that chart as a global
chart has other charts underneath it
a lot of movement pieces so many
movements gets deployed so you can have
that fleet of services
and the simulators that indicate the
game server is deployed in the cloud
accessible whether
it's an internal group of people or xml
if it's external we
so far due to how rapid things are
changing we'll have to have a captain to
have someone who's really running the
deployment
so every deployment in that case is a
get branch
you go take our automation repo and
nikki a branch and that branch would
have some of the facts
that are specific to this deployment
these facts are always changing we're
allowing very last-minute change because
we are a development company we are
really developing
as we go so now we're trying to take
away any
any ability to to to change things very
fast
so that deployment gets created it's a
blue green deployment and
all the resources get allocated around
the world and it's hidden
at this time our internal qa start
hitting it
and depending depending every deployment
has a goal too like every deployment has
a very specific goal whether we're
delivering a feature we're testing a
feature we're collecting feedback
and kiwi hits that has that part hard
and there is a
another checklist with other departments
everyone has to know this is a new gamer
experience where we are exporting or
publishing a full gamer experience it's
not a bunch of
virtual machines just being able in the
cloud and everyone has to get an
agreement and
all the work gets done and then the
players see the light comes on on the
launcher
and i think that's that's where you get
to see more i mean platform is involved
in all of that
like all these systems are super super
involved that platform you get to see
more like okay we're ready to publish
right now and i think benoit can explain
that better than me
yeah so that's where uh usually my team
comes in where uh we've built tools to
allow the
uh the deployment to go out so that
includes securing the build
uh from you know uh who needs to be to
have access to it
as ahmed was pointing out there's a lot
of builds that
players don't see that are used for
internal testing
that are used for you know queueing a
specific feature
or doing ad hoc testing on on a specific
refactor or something like that so
that is internal but the moment it needs
to go external so either it goes on ptu
or on production uh that's where the
launcher release tools come in
and so this allows us to take the build
manifest that miles was speaking about
and basically make it available to
players to patch
and so that's where the delta patching
technology comes in that's able to do
rapidly look at the build that you have
and the build that's now available and
make compute the difference and then
just give you the objects that you need
to run the latest version of the game
obviously for that there's a lot of user
facing services
and every time there's a user facing
service that means a lot of
responsibility related to
security scalability etc etc so that's
mostly the platform teams that take care
of
of the maintenance of those systems but
the operation of it is fully in the
teams and so that's the great part so
that's it's pretty much the build
process in a nutshell
i think in a nutshell that's the
that's the the the nickel version the
knuckle version of the process at the
very least
uh you know we only got an hour long
show here sure
so we do so uh as usual uh
we're taking questions live from the
chat if you have a question that's
related to the
build publish or platform process you
can submit it in the chat
these are all things that exist external
of the game
so as a general rule of thumb if your
question has anything to do with
what's inside the game this is not the
show for that
so those questions won't be asked
additionally we also collected questions
throughout the week as we usually do
from spectrum we pulled out the ones
that were
appropriate to our guests here so let's
start in with those while some of the
live ones come in
uh miles how does the process of
creating and maintaining a build
from a dev branch work uh for example
how is specific functionality selected
from the dev branch
put into a build such as 310 while
others are
left behind in like game dev and then
once it's created
how are these changes maintained between
each build
sure so we actually maintain
dozens of dev streams where individual
features live
and are housed and as those features get
completed
they're they're merged up into the more
collective streams that get tested by qa
as well so we can kind of see how they
play together before creating the
release branch
eventually um usually once everything's
ready for like a 310 or 311 we'll
branch that out and start cutting builds
from there
we have a pretty robust inclusions
process that allows us to
strip it down and make sure things
aren't going out that shouldn't be yet
and then as far as
i think i already touched on that we
kind of have a nice user interface that
developers anybody production can go and
request a build so
production a lot of times is the ones
responsible for kicking the release
builds and
maintaining that pipeline of who does
what when the builds where
um as far as um how to get
selected things so obviously bug fixes
go in our release streams we have a
bunch of internal automated tools
um that as soon as changes are submitted
to those streams we
start bringing those changes back down
to the lower level developers and
distributing them out so that everybody
has access to those changes as quick as
possible
um yeah i think it's i think it's one of
those things that
maybe isn't always apparent that you
know everybody's working in these
individual feature streams
you know so that everybody so that the
active feature team can work in their
stream and the ship team
can work in their stream the ship art
team can work in there you know the
featured team is this one
our team is this one and they're all
working in these different streams so
they don't step on each other's
you know toes and overwrite each other's
work while they're working and then
that process of integration is where
where bugs are born
it's huge um we actually manage quite a
few micro services that kind of back the
whole build process and
uh that's probably the most heavily used
microservices that integration process
at the moment
it it's thousands a day
easily yeah that's uh the the
the number you know you know every every
check-in generates a number when the
and the builds that go live the people
often see like we call it patch 311
but then there's that you know secondary
number the the change log number
you know that is how many different uh
check-ins
there have been each one and then when
people people who follow evocati or
follow pt or whatever when they see
that number rise like that is how many
check-ins
have made that particular bill not
enough check-ins are done just the ones
that actually were included in that
particular build
and put in it's a it's a staggering
number
right it does do a couple traffic jams
on those integration days for sure
yes absolutely um
then what what database technology are
we using
and why uh are we using like what sql
nosql what are we using
well so the the the answer is
complicated but we do use a
plethora of databases uh so
uh platform systems tend to rely on on
structured data and so they're gonna
mostly
leverage technologies like mysql or
mariadb which is the same kind of engine
but we since a lot of the game systems
are also
uh made by micro services then they can
each service can actually use its own
data store and so we have the ability
to use the right data store for the
right use so we don't have it's not like
nosql for everything or sql for
everything right it's more like
this use case needs a structured data
set and so we're going to use this
engine right so
in general uh the technologies that are
in use in the game today and in platform
both
both of them share a lot of these
technologies but uh
mysql is is used to persist a lot of the
data on both ends
there's a mongodb is also a big player
in a lot of the
dynamic variable systems that power the
game and
redis is a as a real workhole workhorse
for a lot of the
really real-time stuff like you know
spectrum red counts or
distributed logs we're going to use
redis for a lot of this which is
it's really our our swiss army knife of
databases there
so the right database for the right job
correct correct anything using like
filemaker pro no
no uh no though though some people want
those features
i was just about to say we advocated
this a week ago we had it but we had to
duplicate it yeah
um ahmed uh what type of
aws servers uh do the platform and pu
currently run on
okay yeah what can you tell us yeah yeah
i mean we
we can tell everything because it's
public offering everyone knows about it
we use a large large large variety of vm
sizes and families but the major
common factor between all of them is the
aws nitro which is a kvm lightweight
technology that aws introduced with the
next generation of new generation
and when it comes to the game servers
the game servers run in c5
if we have some backers watching the
live stream from the days before 3.0
we were doing some comparisons between
the c4 and the c5 these were changes in
the hypervisor changes in the
in the cpu powering the vm underneath
when it comes to the cloud you're
usually trying to
to hit a very specific
sensitive part of your workload so for
the game servers we have to meet in two
main areas we need to maintain a decent
ratio between the memory and the compute
and
we need to make sure that we have very
fast compute so c5s fit that very well
we have other services that are single
threaded that we need a very very fast
single core
clock speed so you would run on z1d also
another nitro
instance we have other services that
require moderate cpu
clock speed but they have larger memory
usage you'll be running an r5
so it it's it's all in our availability
actually uh
a lot of our workload we try not to be
stuck to one single size
because we need to make sure if there is
any issues and we cannot allocate vms
from the size we always have a backup
size we have
backup regions behind our regions but
sometimes you have to choose your battle
whether you're willing to go to a second
region to allocate resources
or you're willing to go for the second
most optimal machine size i
hope this is not so boring but we use a
lot of them and we try to use the new
ones i think that's interesting
the thing that's interesting about that
is that you realize that sometimes you
try to get a vm from the cloud and you
can't because they're out of vms and so
yeah
and you end up playing the world's most
advanced game of whack-a-mole
i mean it's what keeps the job like
interesting and entertaining
it's it just it just got the image what
is it there that the
the ahmed was there was spinning plates
yeah
um a follow-up here uh
are our game servers dynamically
deployed depending on users the user
requesting to play
and can game servers dynamically scale
by load
yes we are very proud of our road
scaling system we have a buffer based
dodge scaling system game servers are a
slot based
so if the game instance will take
specific number of slots you cannot
overload that
so when you auto scale a system like
that you are bound to use what we call a
buffer system where you always have a
step ahead of you
of vms or instances both in the logical
and the like in the physical
the already server players and that
buffer that buffer size how much you
maintain ahead of you has to do with how
fast it takes an
innocence from scratch to load the map
and be ready for players
so these are adjusted this is what
scaling system works on the regional
level so the guys
in sydney could be it could be a rush
hour for them so we start spawning vms
over there
the us and the you are not affected and
yeah it's it's
uh it's a very essential system for us
because game game and behavior like
gamers behavior is always up and down
and we cannot have resources either
around and these these are quite large
vm so we cannot just have them hanging
out for no use
not with that attitude
all right let's see what we got from the
chat here uh
miles what's changed hardware wise
uh since the last time uh we we talked
about this uh
uh and what effect has it had on
build times and publishes sure uh
well i think it's been about four years
since we last talked about this topic so
um we've pretty much upgraded across the
board be that storage
ramps adding more cpus um
we've also spent a lot of time utilizing
all the hardware a lot better with
better build distribution across the
machines
and a lot of that has
helped greatly over the last four years
so we used to
at least six hours per build back then
we could only have
about two running at any given time um
nowadays we're sitting at about three to
four we can have up to four builds
running simultaneous
simultaneous simultaneously
and um we probably put out 12 to 15
builds a day now
um it's pretty regularly especially with
all the feature stream support that
we've added over the last year or two
um the builds are getting kicked very
regularly
and it's almost a constant queue and
stream of builds coming through
where's that phrase come from kicking
builds like what what
when did builds become a thing that were
kicked well i mean it's like kicking a
can down the road right you just keep
it going until it gets through the trash
that's a very appropriate analogy
[Laughter]
that's probably it exactly miles um
is merging feature branches difficult
um it can be
um fortunately for me the developers
typically own a lot of the processes
because nobody can
solve their resolution conflicts better
than they can um
there is a somewhat heavy build process
to that
where um we always try to test the
changes upon
merging and make sure that they're not
going to break anything in the stream
that they're going to
so that that is time consuming i'd say
it was a better
better answer yeah you you mentioned
earlier that that developers have the
ability to kick off a build
is is is that a is that a good thing
i go back and forth on that every day i
think typically it's a good thing the
less barriers
that we can put in front of developers
and allow them to
iterate more quickly without need from
intervention from us
is it helps both them and us because it
frees us up to continue to work on more
tools that
make their workflow more efficient and
and allows them to not be stuck waiting
on us for things
um how do we test and benchmark our
systems for stability
that's interesting so the there's been a
lot of work
there for in the past um to try to get
the
uh get that up to speed um nowadays
uh there are multiple ways where
stability is being tested so
uh on the platform side for example we
have a
a set of tools built on locust which is
a
load testing framework written in python
which is super nice
uh and it allows us to basically
simulate you know thousands and
thousands of users uh so we can write
scenarios about what they do for example
you know uh melt the ship like what if
you know x amount of players melt the
ship right what how does the system
react so we can
we can test that and we've used the same
principle in the same framework to build
a
game uh game facing locust
system that we call pestilence which is
basically
yes i know the naming is nice but
basically what pestilence is able to do
is mimic
what you guys do in game so he's able to
log into the game
connect to the servers and then do
specific actions that we want to test so
if let's say
you know we have a service that has an
issue and we're trying to see what's
causing issues and we can
actually write a scenario that does that
and then we can spawn thousands and
thousands of locusts doing that
in game to simulate what happens when we
actually launch a build because
you know that's usually what happens is
like there's a big storm of people doing
the same action and so
uh so we can test the ability this way
now it's getting more and more
integrated into the process where we
write scenarios for different services
as we go
recently we've added the ability to even
you know
provision account data from it and so
we're able to
you know pre-warm some of the databases
uh to
prevent some services from getting hit
too hard when the patch is launched
things like that so that's one thing
that that's the major thing that we do
for
service and platform specifically for
load testing
on the game side i'll go forward more so
these are headless clients obviously
exactly those are even more than
headless clients they're not even
running the game itself they're
literally just
you know running the cloud side of the
game if you want okay
okay but we do have endless clients as
well that's where i was going
right where there are automated systems
that can do
which is called a cloud test launcher we
can which can actually do that running
the game client as well
but the testing there is more focused
around testing the game server
performance than you know the cloud the
the mmo side of the game basically yeah
that's martin senior and his team
working on that cloud test launcher
we'll actually be talking to
uh his team about it in isc next quarter
hopefully
cool awesome in case people wonder how
often how far ahead we playing these
things
um let's see
ahmed is there hardware parity between
all the different regions
uh it often seems like well let's just
let's just go there let's just it's just
let's just get that one
yeah yeah 100 we do not discriminate
they all they all have the same spec
uh what really happens is player
behavior affects a lot what's happening
in the game server
and also your latency like the the game
server the dedicated game server is a
very very sensitive workload it's very
sensitive to any kind of overheads
instead of any kind of latency issues
so no everything is apparently we do not
discriminate
actually the only workload that we have
the always running the same exact
platform no change
no matter what the environment is is a
dedicated game server there are other
services that we can give them less
resources in smaller environments
because we know they're not going to get
hard when it comes to that monologue
simulator cool dedicated game server we
always make sure that it has the same
exact spec after where it goes
okay i i know the the second half of
that question was
uh what was this person
was from the australian i'm guessing
this person's from the australian region
and they've never seen that it seems a
little more sluggish but as far as the
actual hardware behind
the servers they are at parrot it is the
same yeah and we actually care a lot for
our
our customers in sydney like one time we
had issues in the sydney
abc and we had to locate some uh some
vans in mumbai like in india which is
it's the far but still it was the
closest area in dws and we got really
upset we're like
super fast we're gonna make decision go
back to sydney so if they're having any
issues like i
i guarantee them it's not related to the
hardware
uh how how much storage space is needed
for one game instance
it's the same way that like when it
comes to how much
so that the windows built into linux
build a difference in size
right but the different size is very
like not that big of a deal
that the data file the the the b4k file
that everyone has
i have to have it on my servers too so
we can stream all these all these static
files in and out
and make the game server run so it's
very close to how much you download to
run your client
okay um you you
you said you said linux build and i know
there are people
i've already seen it show up uh you want
to go into
detail server builds linux server build
yes
[Laughter]
i don't talk politics i like technology
just wanna just wanna clear that up
there so that people don't take that
uh where should it be let's see what
else we got from the chat here
uh when a new build is required for the
ptu
how long does it take to compile on
average
three to four hours roughly
is there is there something in
particular that could spike that one way
or the other
um well there's always a lot of load on
the system so that could always
cause times to fluctuate quite a bit um
there's a lot of uploading that takes
place during that so
sometimes the network can be bogged down
it's not just compilation time there's a
lot of fan out and fan and there's a lot
of steps down
we go do a lot of things in battle and
then we can look them back and and these
are systems
sometimes sometimes they are under
development themselves sometimes we make
changes that make things take longer or
take shorter
but yeah if we were talking in general
like might definitely said between three
to four hours i would average
and you're right i'm in that when a
build is finished
cooking it's not ready to be distributed
and it gets low on it for a while now
it's too hot exactly you know
let it let it sit a bit right but no
it's because it needs to be uploaded
right so that it can be distributed and
that step is fairly long as well
that's why the total time is true for us
the client compiles themselves or
relatively quick as
the the data is typically what takes the
longest and that
can go for an hour or two for sure a big
game it is a big game
and only getting bigger uh what methods
practices do you utilize to organize
branch management between teams
um that's base that's our um
kind of our internal feature stream
setup where
we have um teams as they are
getting ready to start work on new
features they will come to us and
request
a feature branch and devops will go
create that feature branch set up their
integration flows
using the automated tools that we
mentioned earlier and
they'll move into that and and once it's
feature complete
we help them where needed to get back
into our dev branches and
kind of repeat the process with teams as
we go
is it annoying trying to find a file
that was supposed to integrate and
didn't
occasionally um
hey benoit let's talk issue council
here's a good one
uh are systems like the issue council
directly linked uh
to the internal jiras or whatever
internal jarrahs and stuff
yeah yeah that's that's been the idea
since the beginning right is that the
uh report that's filed and confirmed on
the issue council gets uh
if you see the cigi on it then it's been
imported
to jira basically and so at that point
it can be tracked internally it can be
assigned to because you know product
you know developers need a jira ticket
to work or check in
right and so that's the way we
legitimize the changes that they have to
do and so
yeah issue consoles connect the the same
same way to feed the status
status back from issue cancel um you
know
there are there's we're aiming to do
improvements to that flow to give more
visibility but
you know we still have a long ways to go
before we can hit that the roadmap is
the same thing the current roadmap so
the cars that you see on the roadmap
also comes from jira so the
the this is a live representation of the
production as
as it stands the moment it gets it gets
put up there
uh so yeah it is connected and that's
the key it's the data source
and the data destination
uh what level of automation
do we have when in our build and
deployment process is it highly manual
is it highly automated
how would you characterize it ahmed
i'll talk about the flaming slides so
when it comes to deployment depending on
that i kind of touched on that earlier
under the
deployment size if it's a smaller
deployment that
locates like reasonable amount of cloud
resources this is fully automated anyone
can go through a go
interface and click and these
deployments you are not allowed to
change so much of them you can only
change a few specific facts
and it's based based on a system that
runs off get off of like a source
version control system
and uh and against the automatically
everything gets built and everything can
get destroyed also by by goi
or by a user interface when it comes to
any large public facing
environment these we're talking about a
lot of resources so in the current phase
of the project because
we also still have systems or areas in
automation that imperative
where we tell it how to do things not
what we want that's that's a very
important topic a lot of people i see
and the questions are from the devops
community that's a big thing we're
trying to shift a lot of our stuff from
telling the automation how to get there
to what we want
and let the automation business system
like frameworks obtain
that state but to go back to the point
if you have a larger
environment at the initial part of it
you have to have a human decision you
have to have a review another human
decision making sure that these are the
correct values
and then it goes from there and it
becomes automated the node scaling kicks
in and manages the environment from here
yeah i think it's uh it's comparable to
a lot to the way that we use
like procedural generation in our our
planets and stuff you can use these
automation tools to help you and to
assist
and to you know get you started or maybe
even finish a job but that's there's
always got to be these
check posts where humans are involved to
validate the decisions to
to determine what's going on it's just
you you'll never
there's there's no replacement for the
human element
and just add something really quick as
the project matures as parts of the
project material as we know we're not
going to be moving a lot of knobs here
we can offset these parts and make it
like
super self maintained self healing is a
big topic in our industry and
we want to talk about it if a reactive
at the active environment or the
environment that reacts to itself and we
might i get to talk about
a little bit about how we're trying to
enhance uh the metrics
or the traces or the logs or the
insights inside our services
so we can let our infrastructure make
decisions based on decent sites
yeah yeah i mean one one key part that's
still a human intervention i think
both on platform and game is the the
flip
of the environments right so the the
game as ahmed was mentioning is
is deployed using a green blue
deployment that means that you
while you guys are playing a game online
on prod for example
and we're preparing a new build there's
the you know that's the blue one
and then the green one's being built or
vice versa right and so at some point
when
the bill's validated there's the the
flip happens
and a human says okay we're flipping and
that's where
the the bill goes live it gets available
and launcher servers are flipping over
and rotating and so that's that's still
a human doing that and it actually
requires a couple people saying
yes yes yes before it actually happens
oh oh no i i remember
i learned that specifically with the uh
the launch of 3.0
when we're sitting we're sitting i'm
sitting in a bathroom with a razor
ready to destroy that giant
gremlin that was on my face and there's
and everybody's going through the go
no-go checks and everybody's like oh
yeah
everybody's right everybody and then it
comes down to it it's got to be chris or
aaron to give the final go before
they actually flip the environment over
and and uh and
and chris goes it's just everybody's
quiet
goes well maybe we should do a couple
more checks i'm sure jared doesn't want
to get rid of the beard just yet
and boy did i i got i'm i'm in that call
i'm supposed to keep it muted i'm not
supposed to contribute i'm just there
monitoring but you can bet i unmuted my
mic
and i'll let some people have some
colorful words
and no one will forget this 2.0 it's
very similar to the build system as well
which is
highly automated but somebody always has
to make the decision to request a build
even if that's a release bill
right from the live chat
is there a secret dev build
a secret dev build secret dev there's
always a secret to building
secret they've all got
[Laughter]
uh ahmed what uh what deployment
strategy are we using are we doing
uh rolling canary what are we using
so we do them all like we discussed in
the beginning about how we do blue green
blue green is usually when we are
delivering uh
a lot of breaking changes a lot of
things are like okay
we cannot have half and half these
things are not going to play nice
together
and this is an in development like a
product currently in development so we
need to get you guys in the new stuff so
we can see what's going on
from the moment that we publish a big
build to a large environment like live
we can do well we call them hot fixes we
can do between five and twenty half eggs
and these are either canary released or
rolled
like in three 310 we carried
six hot fixes for the hub server and we
rolled the last one
uh there and that happens in every
single aspect there are
areas of the game that can allow for
some toggling where we can toggle
features on and off
or hot loading or hot changing data and
there are other areas that
because the challenge in running a game
in the cloud is the statefulness the
experience between
a very immersive game like ours a game
client like ours
and the game server is super stateful
this is a very fragile experience if you
did anything here
you lose that that connection and and we
we are actually always discussing how we
can make it make that less fragile so
people like us
are not do not have so many precious
parts of our environments that we cannot
touch
the players are off but we do both we do
canary we do ruling and we also
initially do a blue green
hopefully in the future as the project
matures we start dealing with the
concept of a deployment
it's an environment that's always going
and there's always pieces moving
all the way around that we we still have
have to do a lot more things before we
get there
it's fair uh miles what's the uh
what's the average duration of a full
production rebuild
on the main star citizen branch
thankfully thanks to our caching we
haven't had to do one of these in a
very i don't think we've had to do one
of those in a while um i think
the last time that we did do one it ran
for about 24 hours
thankfully that almost never happens
nowadays
remember i'm sorry just i'm
i'm trying to remember which chris
roberts game it was
where somebody basically deleted the
entire
uh it basically deleted all of game dev
and they basically savage salvaged the
game by having
somebody had taken a copy home to the
ball game to work at home and they had
to like
they had to like carry this person's
computer from
from home into the office with you know
uh until this i try to remember which
game that was i think it was strike
commander
ben would ben would know ben would know
i think it was strike commander um how
many
uh oh we touched on this a little bit
but
we'll do it again how many human or
manual interactions are there between
commit and deploy
to get a build there's only two it'd be
the
developer making the commit and then the
developer kicking the build
depending on what environment you're
wanting to deploy to
it could be potentially one more human
interaction which
uses the same interface we kick our
builds through to deploy to our internal
staging environments
i think ahmed could address outside of
that for me
yeah yeah if it's a larger environment
it goes through like
people talking it goes through people
deciding that this is the ability
we want to go with and then from then
the humans just just do the decisions
we were talking about earlier everything
is driven by version control everything
is driven by get
but there's a human saying yes and we
did not abstract that into a goo
yet we don't we didn't see the need for
that this is this is
um we call ourselves devops i know this
is some kind of haiti topic for a lot of
people devops is a philosophy not a
title but that's what the market goes
for
but we try to to really hold the values
of devops close to us
we share the ownership of that product
this gaming experience is ours
i can spend more than 50 of my time
investigating an issue about how a
player isn't able to connect something
because i i have the access to all these
tools and i can try to go and
investigate it so to go back when it
comes to deployment to a larger
environment that's usually where
human decisions are being implemented
but all all the actual work of
provisioning
configuring securing is dominated but it
would take days
it would take weeks to deploy the whole
environment manually like with how it
spreads around the world
uh i was trying to remember what was
trying to
remember what the devops uh what that
devops chart was
the the figure
what what what are the points on that
one
trying to remember what they are it's
it's a lot
but see that's the thing these these
terms are coined
and and they create some some issues
sometimes
um my take on this not to i can
take the whole house out there be close
to your problems
know what kind of problems you're trying
to solve and we are in an amazing time
where there are a lot of open source
projects that you can go
and and see what everyone else is doing
and get it done
every every organization taking every
project they can devops is kind of
unique
and we we are one of the very unique
ones
that's a safe bet uh in the last year
what this says in the last year but if
you want to go beyond the last year you
go beyond last year
uh what patch was the most challenging
for you on the back end
if you think of a nightmare patch for
you guys
what what what what's what's the one
that you don't like to think about
you want to go last almond i'm i'm
thinking
i think 3.0 for me because uh
because the the patch before that was so
far right
and and to you know to echo what uh
almond was talking about in terms of
devops philosophy
if you don't deploy for a long time then
you forget how to deploy
right and so 3.0 was the the longest
running in development patch of star
citizen i think that we've had
right and and uh launching that touch on
everything
everything was new there was like it was
the first first for everything so it's
like a brand new game
and so for me that was by far the the
most difficult to get
across the finish line uh and that's
when
you know then going to quarterly made it
a whole lot better
like as now we can deploy you know more
often which is
which is how you get this rhythm going
right and keeping keeping it going it
also means
you know to be fair the more you deploy
the more you break stuff as well
right so there there is a risk there
yeah don't touch it right exactly don't
touch it it's good
but uh yeah for 3.0 for me by far
i don't know for you guys how about you
miles
uh my my problems are very different
usually
uh i'm i'm more heavily involved at the
beginning of the
cycle less than the end so um
3.9 was actually pretty challenging to
transition to
as far as getting the new stream set up
and making sure all the changes were
integrated to where they needed to be
we definitely had a good time with that
one there's a lot of workflow changes at
3.9 for sure
yeah yeah for me it's a difficult take
between 3.0 and 3.9
uh 3.0 definitely 3.0 we rolled out a
new hypervisor a new generation of
virtual machines and
a lot of new things and it was in a very
critical time
i think we have an episode of one of our
shows that i'm not very good at keeping
up with
where we talk about what happened with
3.0 3.0 there there was
there was chats between cr and tony and
uh still very like
i i still remember very very very dear
message to me when tony
said i gotta go put some some gifts
under the tree and come back real quick
that that was 3.0 and it was a lot of
fun it was a lot of
fun uh 3-9 was a lot of fun too with
like fleet week wow
we we we are spoiled by our player base
our blair berries are actually
developing this game with us
and i'm i'm not saying that because like
it's if you really see that
and 3.9 was a lot of people doing a lot
of
we were learning a lot we cannot stop
learning from
what happened during three nights and
flee week
and uh one of the major also ideas in
devops is measure everything
and uh has been when i was talking
earlier testing a game and attributing
this to a game is challenging
it's it's it's relatively doable to test
rbcs or api calls but the immersion
like how the game runs and everything
that is difficult and three nine we we
had that
we had we had that okay everyone is
testing everything
everywhere they're doing everything and
we were receiving all this data
and uh digesting a react into it i i do
not have an accurate number but the
number of half fixes that went in three
and a half day week was really really
high
yeah i was i was wondering if one of you
guys were going to
mention the conversion to the delta
patcher
if not the that conversion but actually
this actually went
pretty well that was 3-0 yeah it was
three i wasn't
[Music]
on ptu for like a month and a half
i just remember my biggest memory about
launching the delta
patch system was the the moment we had
the ability to push a build a day to
players
we did that for 48 days straight it was
like
all right i i do have very vivid
memories of converting the build system
to support that
that was yeah that was definitely a
challenging time as well
yeah i i have a sad memory from 2015 by
coming
to the office at 1am so we can prepare
the old school bed so we released
at 6am and that was voluntarily like
like we would go and work on it because
it used to take hours to prepare these
facts and make sure you have all the
diffs between all the old versions
yeah you actually bring good memories
about the delta vector
and right now sometimes we see we look
at the cdn graph
absent we see these beta bytes coming
out like can you imagine if the delta
bachelor was not here how much data
you're pushing
it's yeah it's one of these things that
we take for granted now but it was an
amazing big exchange for us critical
technology for sure
it's a seemingly simple thing but it's
like absolutely critical to
the ongoing life of any mmo
uh let's see what else we got um
will i cash and global persistence
change how
long term persistence is handled
oh well that's interesting so um
not really in fact the the long-term
persistence was engineered to basically
uh persist your data that you earn in
game between patches right so
it saves your money and the history of
all of the uec money that you've got so
every transaction up and down
current values of all the your ledgers
um the inventory systems
that's part of ltp is also there to
store hey you own a hornet right
or a you own a constellation right um
the state of these objects so you know
oh this hornet's missing is like
left wing was or was abandoned at grim
hex or
so that's stored in this in the
persistent system so icash will
basically bring more state tracking more
state persistence
but we're still going to persist the
same amount or the same kind of records
between patches to be able to
rebuild the state when we do a
data wipe on the icash site so the the
reason and the reason why that's
still an issue is because the schemas of
those objects is still moving right and
so we
we still need to do that but um the only
change that will come from it is that
um there are some parts of the icash api
that allow better handling of stacking
objects so let's say you buy 50
magazines right
the way that's handled in the akash is
is much better and so
the ltp systems will track that better
and so
that's not the only change but the
functionality for players should
function the same way
and for anybody that hasn't checked it
out uh check out the last the previous
episode of calling all debs where we
talked with chad mckinney about
uh icash and its effect and lead into
global persistence
uh let's see we got 10 minutes left
we're almost done
are there any improvements to publishing
technology you're excited about in the
near future
yes so as we take some of our legacy
systems
through imperative uh described
deployment where we're describing to
automation system how to do things to
into more declarative systems
we don't want to throw in a lot of
jargons but people who work in devos
technology most probably know what we're
talking about here that is very exciting
for us we're also
looking at how we can leverage some of
the bare metal
resources that allowed a lot of cloud
providers now we've always been trying
to squeeze as much power as we can get
and we want to see what
will happen when we are going to have
the hypervisor anymore maybe maybe we'll
get some some more
power out of it uh again we we are not
until we measure till we measure things
and we say benchmarks but yeah i'm
excited for
these two things one of the most
important things i'm excited for we have
two new engineers that will join the
team on monday
so that is that is a big thing hopefully
more hands on the keyboard more minds
more more people designing all these
challenging solutions with us
so yeah a lot of a lot of good stuff
happening this has definitely been a uh
uh a year of growth actually last year
was here
we've been growing for a while so i'm
thinking about it
uh over 600 and somewhat people knew
yeah let's see all right
we've been throwing yeah we've been
throwing these softballs let me look for
some hard balls here
when a server crashes here we go when a
server crashes
why
when a server crashes uh how long is it
until that server is ready to go again
and is this process automated yes so
the server doesn't have to come again if
if we are actually in a timer we're
shrinking down we are actually have a
lot
the servers can go away and never get
used again there's another pool of
servers
if we are in a time actually we need
resources the server will crash and it
will come back in a different new
incarnation
we'll have new logical name to it have
new id to it and i'll become part of the
pools
of innocences that can host games but
yeah
nothing nothing has like a long-lasting
name or a long-lost
existence everything is that the common
word that we use in our field is a
thermal
so these instances are just instances
they come and go all the time
no one touches them they decide to
question their own they get sad
ants not cattle cattle not pets right
yeah yeah absolutely absolutely
ephemeral good word use ahmed
[Laughter]
uh what benchmarks do you use to
determine how a particular build
progresses
from evocati to ptu to live now before
you answer that though
i want to clarify that it's nobody in
this call that determines whether
something goes from one stage
to another stage those are those those
are calls made by
uh you know you know the the directors
and above and stuff like that but as far
as the benchmarks just speaking to the
type of information
that we use to make those calls
it's a very collective democratic call
the way it works
whenever we are in the mode of releasing
we have the live sync meeting that
like one of my favorite meetings we get
to have it early in our day
kind of like towards the end of the day
in europe and we bring up a lot of data
whenever we go to btu there are several
types of reports
one of them is the stability report the
stability report tries to model
that how much disruption we are causing
to the player experience
and then we have a player feedback
report that comes from the player
experience team and it takes an account
all the
issue council issues the feel of the
game if there are
specific features in the gameplay qa
also goes and takes that
that report and goes through and try to
reproduce
by the morning by the next morning all
these like
data got collected we have performance
data and then then
everyone has a case right and it's it's
a lot of
conflicting factors together that decide
sometimes
we want to progress faster between waves
because we need the
concurrency we need more players to see
things how how things are going
and you get to decide what the messaging
is going to be like what's the trade-off
okay it's going to be amazing in all
these areas and this feature is going to
be really bad i think our players our
backers will understand that we can just
explain
avoid this area it will be all right and
yeah it's a lot of moving factors when
it comes to benchmark it's
it's a quantified collected crash
information stability information
performance
information resource usage information
all collected together we'll abstract
the number in a model
we call the stability score and the same
side also we have
we have hardware working teams that try
to collect and summarize the game
experience
and both of them get together and then
we have different goals and different
groups
and a very democratic way of deciding
how things would go and yeah
hopefully we make the good decisions
every time that's a
that's a that's a great answer there's
there's there's a ton of hard data but
then there's also
that um that experiential
stuff that we get from from our qa and
stuff from the
from the rep we use we go to the player
experience
you know teams you know and get their
feedback from the players just like that
and all of that gets put into a
a gumbo of sorts where we it looks and
it creates a picture that's unique for
every single
uh release candidate and it's it's like
you know
from this candidate to this candidate to
this candidate uh
the the exact criteria that determines
whether
this moves forward and the next step may
be different for each one
uh so it's a there's no easy a rubber
stamp answer for it but uh we use
as many tools and uh equipment and
people as possible to make the best
possibilities
even even development teams like some of
the game service guys are going to be
watching
live ptu builds when they're you know to
see
performance metrics and get a sense of
it right and so that's also in the mix
you're right it is a hodgepodge of
different you're full of [ __ ]
you're always there just like kick it
just kick it out
just push it go go
when was in these things he's like i'm
on the east coast it's already late just
push it
time bills uh that's it guys
you've done it congratulations uh thank
you
for taking the time out of your busy
days at the end of your week
uh to be here on the show with us um
it's it's a i i it's not it's not always
the uh
it's a relatively dry subject uh for for
folks and people often ask me why
uh why are you doing this i'm like
because this shit's important
and that's twice i've sworn the last
five minutes that's right
i'm gonna get an email i'm gonna get an
email sorry guys uh we are going to uh
we are going to do a raid who are we
raiding today uh we are rating a similia
uh similia is a streamer in sweden if i
remember correctly
uh so so check them out um
and uh if you if you jump into the raid
uh there that when it kicks off here
uh tell samilia uh
to push it live benoit said push it live
ship it push it benoit said
what did i say sweden i think i meant
switzerland switzerland switzerland
so check that tell me where's america
it's cool called the outer world
i'm just joking i'm just joking uh
please send all letters to here
uh james austin texas
for ahmed for miles for benoit i'm jared
take care everybody and we'll see you
next week
you
