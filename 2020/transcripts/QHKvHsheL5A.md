## Transcript

hi everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live game dev
weapons grade i'm your host uh jared
huckabee
uh if you've never seen star citizen
live before uh it's where we take about
an hour out of our day at the end of a
week
and we either answer some questions
about the development of the game
or we speak with artists designers
conceptors programmers sometimes
one time we did a show on schedules with
producers we just explore their process
how they go about their work how they
make the things uh that they make
for star citizen and that's what we're
doing here today so let's
it's it's a let's introduce our panel of
esteemed guests
some of them you may have seen before
some of them this may be your first time
so we'll go we'll go around the room
and we'll meet who's talking uh jake
since you're in the
corner there let's just start with you
who are you and what do you do for star
citizen
hello uh i'm jake taylor and i'm a prop
and 3d weapons artist
and so you make props and 3d weapons
indeed
don't no no don't need to explain that
all right all right
okay uh moving along clockwise corey
you've been on the show you're you're an
sel veteran but it's somebody's first
show who are you
cory banford lead proper ice so i
mostly chase these lot around now
now that that's at least new the last
time we had you on the show you weren't
a lead so congratulations yeah oh check
congratulations
it's good it's good fun i enjoy it
congratulations
it is so soft i i i'm not chilling this
is this is mine this is just this is
beyond personal time here
it's very soft um yeah and then uh uh
that was my going around the room i
realized i had to be up next so that's
pico
he's a penguin that's his introduction
and last but certainly not least david
who are you what do you do for star
citizen yeah my name is david zipper
and i'm a senior weapon artist on star
citizen
so i do a lot of fps weapons
sometimes ship weapons but i'm mostly on
on fps weapons
you helped us out with our visual guide
fps weapons
that we did in jump point a couple
months ago i really appreciate that by
the way i don't
i don't think i ever said thank you by
the way thank you
all right so let's turn let's that's
enough for enough for the introductions
let's get into the show
actually i understand that we have a lot
to talk about so i'm going to turn it
over to you guys
what are we doing today
going jake no jake jake's
okay uh yeah so we'll be able to show
off the block out of the new gemini
sniper rifle
and we could also show off the shotgun
which is a bit more head
a bit more ahead and we can also look at
uh the where
the pipeline that we do and just answer
any questions talk about that kind of
stuff
all right all right well you've got a
lot so we'll keep you on the clock then
you want to start the screen share and
take us away cool
so corey david do you want me to just
like start talking and you're like
interrupt me as you wish i mean i'm
keeping on a chat so if people have
questions about what
jake's doing um david and i'm sure we
can field them and just generally
discuss yeah i'll go i'll go ahead and
take care of the questions sure yeah no
worries
i'm not gonna answer like when is x
coming out or anything like that don't
worry
please don't ask us that we don't know
and uh for folks who
want to submit questions during the
course of the show uh remember you can
submit your questions in the chat with
the word question
uh any capital letter surrounded by
brackets that's going to help our
community management team
pull out which questions are appropriate
for our group here
and then they'll pass them to me and
then i'll pass them to the team uh
remember that these are
three artists so if your questions are
about how this works
or how that works or will we get this or
whatever
uh this is not the show for those kind
of questions everybody
art based questions for art based people
for simple people yep uh cool
so on the screen you can see the concept
for the sniper rifle so this is the
first thing that
as an artist will see and
this is based off a model as well so we
have the lucky opportunity that our
concept artists are also modellers
so we get to take this in and
essentially
already work off a really good base so
if i bring in the concept now because
right now you're looking at the block
out
show selection this is
that model for the render that you see
here and
if i show off all the geometry you can
see that it when making
no uh mind was put into making this
cheap
or or cleaning i'm already seeing
1.3 million polygons
yeah that's a that's a good point you
raised i want to make sure that that
gets
across there concept models even even
when done in 3d
are because they're explorations because
they're working fast because they're
iterating
super quickly uh there is no uh
conservation of of of of information or
polygons being done
there's no efficiency being done so that
is people often ask why don't you just
put the concept model
in the game uh it's because if folks
remember
uh longtime folks might remember the uh
uh freelancer when the freelancer was
remade the first time
uh way back around 2014-ish uh
it had rivets in them it had rivets in
them that were
there were something like uh like like a
hundred
try a hundred thousand tries so just the
rivets alone were just ridiculous and
somebody copy pasted the rivets
and into the actual game freelancer
model and it made things very bad for a
while
so you don't use concept models in the
game yeah it's
it's when concept artists do use 3d
uh packages they'll tend to use
usually quite different actual um
software as well so they'd be
i know that a fair few concept types to
do it for you we'll be using certain
fusion 360 which is more
for um basically like cad and stuff it's
not
really even the software itself isn't
really designed to create
the same sort of geometry as you know
game ready stuff
so especially with our workflow where we
um you know in a lot of video games what
you'll do is you'll create like a high
poly model
and then you'll sort of transform that
and you'll like bake that information
down onto
a simpler piece of geometry um
in in our workflows you can see what
jake's doing here is actually modeling
in like a lot of the chamfers
um so every everywhere there's like a
rounded edge that actually gets modeled
in
so yeah you can't really transfer the
information directly it's more of
a process of like reconstructing the
shapes
um to be optimal optimized for like a
you know
game-ready scenario
so you're you're you're in the process
of this is literally like
uh you're you're you're about as far
along in the process as you are
you know building this out and
converting it from the concept uh one of
the questions from the chat
is uh what do you anticipate the dif the
greatest difficulty
for this weapon to be at this point i
know you're you're still in early days
here
um i know that already because i've had
to tackle it a bit
and it's it's this area around here like
all this kind of gubbins because
if i focus on the concept a sec um
not only have you got kind of like these
really difficult organic
shapes in a hard surface asset they're
all very slightly kind of turning in
and oh wow that's yeah that's one of the
biggest um
problems we need to tackle while doing
it is that that everything needs to be
animated it needs to work the magazine
needs to rotate out
it has a mechanism and and all that
needs to work
and the parts shouldn't intersect you
know shouldn't move
into each other and and you know having
that ugly intersection that
that's something we need to prevent
while while doing it
and and of course you know that's
something that concept artists know to
look out for
uh you know through metrics and stuff
like that but you don't always
discover every single uh uh
edge case and uh issue during the
concept process
yeah that's how that's fine
um that that's why we're doing a
blockout so we're doing this blockout in
this state
and already do a rig a rig is basically
a skeleton that an animator can use
and the animator then tests it in engine
and we can we while doing it we already
usually run into issues and and see um
how this this works out and then uh here
we can see that the mechanism pretty
pretty nice um we can test all that in
engine
and reiterate on it because uh in this
state it's really easy to rebuild
rebuild
something or change something but if
it's final
and we have already made textures and so
on so the more we've
done on it the harder it gets to um to
change
you know so in this state it's it's
still
pretty easy to uh change around shapes
and and rebuild it
yeah and for those asking uh he's
working in maya right now
yeah it's quite um it's quite
interesting because a lot of
um a lot of the assets in star citizen
for instance
ships um props and environment they're
typically made in 3ds max but um
character animations and
charac you know and that's all done on
in maya so
you know for fps weapons it makes a lot
more sense to be using maya
um you know you could you could
technically make it all in max but
it's mostly just the animators and the
rigs will need to be admired anyway so
if you can do the art in maya as well it
just kind of streamlines it you're not
supporting
two different source files it just makes
things a lot neater
um and yeah the workflow has kind of
been adapted to that
uh in chat they have a question uh
couldn't there be a tool of some kind
that just takes the concept model and
then just
breaks it down from there that would
that would be the yeah
that would make our jobs obsolete
yeah i think like that's what we there's
a lot of automation
that can be done um for 3d modelling but
um i think it's just due to the fact
that we've got such a a specific
workflow i think it would
be very difficult to get a computer you
know a computer program or an algorithm
or something to actually reproduce those
results perfectly
we we do use um for things like lods
in in some other workflows we have um
systems that
generate our lots for us or you know we
have a lot of scripts to automate parts
of the process but as a whole because we
have this focus on optimization
and we have a lot of different
requirements that really
for a human once you know the rule set
is quite simple but
for i think getting like i don't know
like ai or some sort of
program to do man i think maybe in 10
years maybe in 20 years or something we
might have
you know we might be closer to that but
it would also require a longer concept
period because all of those
absolute things the the functionality
would have to be completely totally and
utterly worked out in the concept phase
and while we certainly target that and
we certainly take those things in mind
during the concept phase
uh anybody that's followed uh the
development over time knows that
that sometimes things just have to
change from concept because metrics
change the the the scale and scope of
development changes
uh the lessons we learn along the way as
we make each one of these
uh improves uh it's just it's a lot
easier for a human to adapt
than it is for some automated tool
yeah i think like if you look if you
look back at
um a lot of the workflows that we had
you know even even
10 years ago for video games it has
you know we have seen a lot of changes
in that there are a lot of workflows
that do rely more on um like procedural
generation
or you know computer assisted kind of
stuff
um but yeah i think you know there's
it's it's it's a conversation obviously
as artists we have a lot is
you know how long is it until our jobs
are going to radically change because
you know
things like um deep learning well you
know like deep learning algorithms and
stuff are basically going to be like
you know make this like i think nvidia
have done some interesting stuff like
landscape generators and things right
you know when they're gonna when are
they gonna make a landscape generator
for
3d art it's i think with hard surface
assets it's
because they're so sort of organized in
their structure
it's really hard to get a computer to
make them if that makes sense
because i know it sounds kind of
counter-intuitive but when you have an
organic asset
it doesn't really matter if the topology
isn't perfect right you can just kind of
munch it so yeah i think
you know things like photogrammetry and
stuff generally work better on like
rocks
yeah well and one of one of the core
tenets of star citizen is that
you know we use automation and tools and
everything to
help our workflow and to assist artists
anything but not to take over the work
from them
there's it's you know some games would
use procedural generation
and spit out the finished product we use
procedural generation in like our
planets and stuff
to provide a base from which artists
then go
and do their work after the fact so it's
we we use scripts and that kind of stuff
to help us along the way but not to do
the work for us
at least today there's no substitute for
that human touch
um one of the questions one of the
questions from the chat
is uh how long uh how long a process
would this normally take i know
there's there's almost no normal in game
development but
looking at this well when you got this
model what was your estimate on how long
it would take
to make this game ready from the
timeline i would say
it's it's um it depends on how many
problems come up
while doing it like in the optimal case
you can do it in about two weeks i would
say
in a non-optimal case where we need to
change a lot where problems come up
and we realize them pretty late in the
process that that
sometimes happens sadly um it can
take up to a month or so that sometimes
when when problems come up super late in
the process that
eats up a lot of time but usually we we
try to plan it
pretty good and get it done as fast as
possible
and yeah and that's right sorry not good
no good good i guess that's the main
reason for like the
the sort of blockout phase like what we
would normally do is we get the concept
mesh
run it through some optimization
processes and get that in game
and then you know you can see the
character holding it we can say does
this work on the mail rig does it work
on the female rig does it tick all the
boxes for the hand grips and stuff
you know uh jake will probably show you
um another weapon later where we had to
make some
adjustments to the weapon from the
concept because
the the grip wasn't quite working um
just through like
you know while the concept artists are
very aware of the sort of
you know the application of a weapon
unlucky humans holding it they
they don't necessarily test all the you
know they can't necessarily test all the
use cases
so sometimes we do come back and we you
know we get it in and we're like okay
this isn't working
tweet the proportions here maybe you
know make make some changes
you know just just just purely because
it needs to be used by a character
and i'll show that now sure as well one
of the the problems
that came up for example with the
shotgun here is that the
the magazine actually sticked a little
bit too much into the armor of the
character and we we had to address that
and and
that's something while doing the weapon
itself um
sometimes you can't even think about the
possibility that the magazine
because of the shape it has it it kind
of like clips too much into the the body
of the character
and and therefore we had to like change
the orientation of it that the flat side
is on the body and not the round side
that you can see here
if that makes sense so some of those
changes that
you guys are mentioning and if i change
over to the
shotgun concept and this was a concept
that we were given
and i can't really show them side by
side so i'm just going to quickly flash
between the two of them
but if i point it out in the concept
here
we've got kind of got like this trigger
and then this nice angle here that leads
into
the magazine and then it kind of leads
out into this really nice long barrel
and this area is where most of the
change happened
we were having issues with what you said
david like uh
the character's arm and clipping with
this barrel
and we're limited right by how big this
barrel needs to be because
we want it to specifically contain i
think it was like 12 shotgun shells
so i had to make this thicker this has
to be sitting
right up against the trigger now um and
this whole nose area had to be brought
in way back
and um because there's a pump action as
well if you look here like the handle's
quite
slim and if you were to grab that and
drag that back and forth you probably
break your fingers on this or something
there also wasn't any like buffer was
there
on it wasn't like on a rail whereas what
you've got now is you've got the the
sort of foregrip
sound forwards quite a lot and it'll
articulate backwards because this
correct me if i'm wrong but this this
has got like a pump action on a fully
automatic mode right
um i don't want to semi-automatic sorry
you don't think you're right i don't
think you're right
so it's got a drone mag and it's it's
just a pump action uh they're a surprise
i i i i can say that there was some
healthy discussion about that topic
uh between richard tyron and cr the
other day it's still under review i
think
okay yeah i know that was initially
this sort of brief but yeah maybe let's
change now cool
yeah and as you can see um like we we
model it pretty
detailed so that you can look inside and
you even see the shotgun shell inside on
the magazine
um yeah you can even zoom in see the
shotgun shell
and what the animator does it he takes
the top
shell and actually animates it into the
chamber
if you like having a slow motion in
engine like by
10 speed you can see the shell moving in
there while the
bolt is moving back yeah actually like
this basically
and that is a really nice touch and most
people won't even notice but
but it's it's really cool that we have
it in engine i think
i should be able to exactly so you
you're switching around here so you're
now in
inside the lumberyard oh we lost the oh
there we go so this is now inside
lumberyard
yeah so you can show off that shotgun
uh i just let them drop to the floor and
then pick them up from the ground
because
you're a savage i'm a professional get a
table jake the table's right over there
yeah uh but yeah we should
fire a shot you can very very quickly
see that come out see a dude's torso
through the other
side
a little fun
perfect dummies so i can really see how
this gun feels
it's looking cool yeah
uh those guys just showed up for some
bikini calendar shoot
yeah uh you got a a question from the
community here um for artists
uh what are your limitations poly uh
polygon count wise
uh this first was this person saw the
barrels flash hider
uh looked like it had a ton of polygons
in it uh
and and then is gaming really moving
away from polygon restrictions
um yeah i think i can say something
about that so you can see on this one
together with the magazine is around 52
000 polygons which sounds quite a bit
but
you need to consider we have a different
workflow than
uh most other studios have so our
workflow is custom normals
so all these like at the front or jake
is showing it with the cube here
um so yeah this has 12
triangles and if you bevel it it already
has 44
but um if you select the vertices now on
it
um like if you can select all of them
you will see that that it's 24
and because of the hard edges here like
the hard edges basically
split the the object into multiple faces
on the left cube so right
exactly exactly and and the vertex count
is actually
the same for them or nearly the same so
that's actually what matters in the end
is the vertex count and
um another reason another thing that
matters is small polygons
but we are using level of details of the
weapon
so like after about like one meter or
one meter um 50 it already has um
it's getting rid of the small little uh
bevels here at the side
so you basically after 1 meter 50 you
see the
the left cube instead of the the right
cube right so our weapons use the same
leds that ships do so so so that way we
when we look up close at it we can see
all the full
crazy detail and then everybody else
who's running around in game they're
seeing a lower lod version
until they get until they get really up
close it's also worth mentioning and i'm
not
an engineer or a graphics programmer so
i might you know this is going to be a
layman's explanation but
um the advantage of this workflow
where you're putting a lot of detail in
the geometry of course it will increase
your your triangle count your vertex
count
however in a lot of games like i said
earlier they they actually bake
um they actually bake the high poly
information into
a lower poly version and they create a
texture for that called a normal map
which essentially per pixel will give
you like
the angle essentially
say you have 200 props or weapons in a
scene
and you're loading in 200 of those
unique
textures it's quite a lot of texture
memory
whereas with our workflow we do use
textures for some things like palm
the materials themselves and so on but
we don't have like a lot of unique
texture memory
taken up per asset so you're actually
kind of
you know we're basically taking up
more overhead in terms of poly count but
we're also reducing the amount of
texture overhead
in a way so it's kind of swings around
about
um i think hardware is a huge part of
that and that's not really a topic i'm
you know hugely educated on like to you
know
actually you know what modern specs are
for graphics cards and you know it's a
difficult one to really explain it's
nice but
essentially like you know we're kind of
prioritizing
reducing texture and memory versus you
know the amount of triangles we have
yeah uh in a question that
asks to look behind the curtain and see
if oz is really there
uh for the magazines do the weapon
magazines actually have individually
modeled
rounds inside them um
and do you move out of the magazines we
need to trick it a little bit to
for like not having too many polygons so
the top
round is usually modeled completely and
the one under it has
a little bit less details than the top
one and
if you go even deeper into the magazine
you maybe even have a cylinder with the
red stripes
so you if you have like a glimpse from
the side you can still
yeah and in this case you can still see
it pretty good but on some magazines
it's it's
um the shadow is actually taking away
the detail anyway so you can
can um use more uh less
less details the deeper you go in yeah
things like um grenade launchers and
such where
all the um well you know not bullets but
rounds are visible
they'd have to be modeled in yeah yeah
but in terms of the capacity and stuff
is you know stored as a value somewhere
so
they're kind of there but sometimes
they're not drawn sorry go on jared
no no that's it you
you do it you do what you got to do to
squeeze every answer performance where
you can
that's true for most video games i think
or at least we should be
yeah we even even though we use more
polygons and the workflow we do is is
still optimized quite a bit so um
we're not using a heavy load of textures
like corey said before
which can in some cases if you use a
2000 by two thousand resolution
or four thousand by four thousand you
can easily get to um
like a hundred megabyte per weapon and
um if we have like
a hundred weapons in game it it gets too
heavy and we had to like
think about ways of reducing it so
and our workflow with the custom normals
is really scalable
um you can use it on weapons you can use
it on buildings
and and on it doesn't matter really what
you do with it
it all works yeah and that's why it's so
strong in my opinion
yeah it's um it's quite uh
yeah the scalability is really important
especially for
um say props for instance where you have
like
i don't know an absolutely obscene
amount of them like
you know you need them to be we wanted
to look good we wanted to have a lot of
detail
but we also want them to be fairly
cheap uh folks are still talking about
whether the shotgun was
and semi-auto there are so no no there
are accommodation
uh pump semi-auto uh shotguns in the
world i think the the tech 12
and there's one from uh the european
union his name i i can't remember right
now
they're rare but but they exist uh as
far as that one goes
uh i know it's still under discussion
about whether it's going to be both or
whether it's going to the spas thank you
see
there's the chat is that's what i was
trying to remember the spas
so see you always count on chat
uh so yeah so they are out there so i
don't i don't
i know that that's currently under
discussion about whether where that's
going to land whether it's still going
to be a hybrid or whether it's going to
be one to the other
all right or just our only pump it's
definitely going to have pump let's put
it that way
there is a pump on it yeah exactly there
is a pump on it it will definitely have
pumped i think the question is just
whether it's
yeah uh semi automatic as well or not so
so check back later folks
one thing i wanted to say as well uh
those who are
uh paying real close attention you
probably saw that i did some work and
they pretty much
went back on it all and that's just
gonna happen sometimes a lot of time
you'll try and tackle a situation
realize that it won't quite work and
then you'll just tackle it in a
different way
so i try to get rid of the negative
space on this
on this shape here first and then with
this shape here and try to combine them
and realize
oh that's not going to work i'm going to
do it this way instead and
now i can get rid of that negative space
once these two pieces are combined and
little things like that yeah and you
always need to consider we're working
like in in sub-millimeter
sizes here sometimes so like the edges
are like
0.7 millimeter or something it's like we
need to do it a little bit
bigger than it would be in the real
world because
if you do it in a game engine um really
hard edges are
like pixelated a lot and and you're
reaching a point where
it looks better where when you do it a
little bit bigger even though it's
unrealistic
yeah so we have like a like the minimum
value of
i would say like point seven millimeter
and usually i go for one millimeter for
edges
yeah on on it's probably way more
because the objects are bigger right
yeah usually uh our safe minimum is like
for say like something that's like a
meter square a meter cube would be like
half a centimeter we'd say the chamfers
it's it's kind of down to the use case
like if we have a prop that you pick up
and inspect
you know similar to a weapon you'd
probably want those chamfers to be
sort of tuned to where they are in
screen space if that makes sense
like how big they are relative to the
size of the the
you know where they are in the world but
yeah
now i think the nice thing about
modeling this kind of stuff is it is
definitely like an iterative process
you know you're kind of you're problem
solving as you go you're sometimes
tapping shapes you've never
kind of worked with before or you know
employing a ton of different modeling
techniques
you said editor is that iterative for
playing the star citizen drinking game
you have to drink
what's your best modeling advice for an
amateur cg artist
uh this person specifically uses moto
and zbrush at the moment
yeah for starters it's it's
um the software it really doesn't matter
that much i would say like you can use
blender it's free
or you just try to get a um a version
from from your uni or so if you're using
my or max it's also good it's
most the people in the industry use maya
or max
so that's always a safe bet i would say
but
it's most important is that you keep
doing work you know even if it's not
good in the beginning
just continue don't stop doing your work
try to improve
try to get into into fields that that
you know
you're interested in if you like
characters go into characters and
if you go for like more like weapons um
then then try to do a lot of weapons
right try to learn more about weapons
how they work
because for example on weapons you know
you you need to
kind of understand the mechanics behind
it a little bit at least
so yeah it's always helpful to have your
a proper mindset for what you're doing
you know that that's really important
yeah i think using reference is a
a very important thing when you're
starting out as well like
um also you know there's tons of
communities out there for
um getting feedback and stuff like you
know you'll find that there's a lot of
communities where you'd have industry
veterans you know in like discords and
stuff
you can get feedback from them they can
tell you sort of where
you're making mistakes with your
modeling um like
i think reproducing a shape is quite
easy
reproducing a shape elegantly is where
the sort of challenge in
you know what i would call like
production are you know we're not
necessarily
concept artists we're not sort of
designing these forms ourselves
but we're reproducing them with a set
kind of criteria
right you know if you think about it
like pixel art if you're a pixel artist
you're you're employing a bunch of
techniques to you know
reproduce something in that sort of
style this is this is sort of similar
if you're if you're interested in in
video games specifically getting into
being a
3d artist for video games definitely
learning about the techniques
that we employ is you know gonna
get you a long way um or if you're
interested in like you know
cgi like film and stuff you know they
use a whole
another bag of tricks and you can kind
of yeah
yeah probably modeling for them looks
like the concept you did before
so for film it it like of course they
need to kind of
look that they don't use five million
polygons for screw
but uh they they they kind of like don't
care too much for
for like the um like the i would say the
polygon quality
you would say like like that's more for
game art that we like
you know have to look a lot how
optimized it is and that you for example
for this piece we have like 200 polygons
and for films you could use i don't know
a couple of thousand for for this piece
alone here yeah
real-time rendering means you know we're
rendering the asset
you know 60 120 you know
however many frames per second so
it's very specialist hardware doing a
very sort of specialist task um
for films it's like they chuck it on an
offline render it just choke yeah i'd
like to serve the farm
it'll just be absolutely chugging away
you know so they can
they can render like you know an hour of
footage over
you know 20 computer weeks or whatever
i'm not sure what the ratios are i'm not
too up to date on the film industry
specs but
you know for games it's it's got to run
you know it's got a run
uh a frame rate that you know is
sufficient for people to actually
interact with it
and and that's why when you're working
on games you're you're really a
technical modeler
so a big part of our work is is not i
would say art in the traditional sense
of just
doing nice things it's it's also a lot
of work that
that goes into learning the techniques
and um yeah that's
in for games especially you need to know
how to do your stuff and then with the
knowledge you have
you can do art but go coming to a point
where
you you're so good that it's you you
basically know it in and out and just
can do content over and over um that's
that's a hard way definitely
yeah you've also got to consider the
fact that the hard surface modeling like
what we're doing here we're creating
you know machined industrial things
that's only a single facet of what
you know it can mean to be a game artist
you could be a an environment
artist in which case you're making
terrain you're making rocks you're
making that kind of stuff and we do a
bit of that on the props team
um or you know you could be a character
art you know studying anatomy learning
about
you know how muscles and faces and stuff
work
like character artists aren't real
artists
character concept artists aren't real
artists
we'll make a very specific character
character concept artists in l.a
aren't real artists we'll just i'm not i
don't want to start with those guys
just narrow it down right there we're
good
you're trying to drive a wedge between
us jared and i'm not gonna let it happen
between you i'm the one that's going to
hear about it
yeah um do you guys
typically do high poly to low poly bakes
even on unique assets like weapons props
stuff like that or do you ever use like
a mid poly no bake workflow
yes that's all our work is so what
jake's doing now is he's making like
basically we use this thing called
custom normals or weighted normals
where essentially your big flat faces
you point the normals
straight and then you'll have like a
single sort of 45 degree angle edge
and then the normals will be kind of
facing um you know towards the the
larger surfaces and it'll
fake a curve essentially so we don't
bake any of our assets because
you know i've got i don't know a
thousand props and if each one had its
own texture and you were like okay load
all the props into this level it would
just go
and then it would die so yeah we we tend
to just
we only really bake unique assets when
it's
either something really special for
squadron or
um it's an organic asset that
you wouldn't be able to throw enough
triangles out to do it justice any
anyway and it would end up cheaper just
streaming in a texture um we didn't
quite talk about uh
palms uh before it's like the way we do
details
so um so poms is is a short
form of parallax occlusion mapping and
we use it for stuff like
especially that goes in you can see this
indents here and
what we do is like we we kind of model a
high poly
that's the only case where we use it
that's why i'm
yeah i can do it now and um so you can
see that they have like
that that it really has perspective it
really goes in and that is because it
has a height map basically everything
that's low is is black and everything
that's
high is is uh white so um
yeah you can can even if you zoom in it
still looks super cool
because it's it's really giving
yeah it's it's really giving the the
certain perspective we need for screws
and so on
yeah palms are amazing when we started
using those
we started using those that that changed
things overnight
so it's basically putting a sticker on
it with the detail and you can use the
stickers as
much as you want basically and it's it's
kind of
like baking a map but just for the
little part where you want the detail to
be right
for like like screws and indents it's
it's not worth to model them
it's it's really easy for us to just oh
yeah jake
yeah there you go so yeah so so just to
make sure folks
are getting this here the screws and
everything a lot of those intents
they're not
actually like modeled it's a sticker
that goes on and then
yeah it's looking good yeah and the
beautiful thing about
having it as a sticker is it's not sort
of it's not
um unique to that single you know set of
pixels
you can place it wherever you want on
the weapon so you can have a bolt
that is i don't know 64 by 64 pixels
of texture memory and you slap it on
like 90 your asset on like a thousand
props
you know you're streaming in that one
set of um you know displacement maps
slapping it on like you know hundreds of
props
and you you're just streaming that in
you know what the second you stream one
property and it'll stream in that
texture
and then you bring the rest in it's like
eh you know that's fine we've already
got that texture
so performance wise it's it's real nice
yeah and it can in in some cases it can
be like
uh i don't know like 200 kilobyte or
something because it's a really small
texture that you're using over and over
again
it's it just needs to be really these
small pieces and
like the traditional way of doing it in
in a lot of
games that are still done and have been
done before
is is doing basically this technique but
for the whole weapon even
in places where it technically doesn't
make much sense to have it
because on on a flat surface we just
don't need it right
we don't need to to tell the engine that
a flat surface is flat because it's
already flat
yeah if that makes sense
yeah i saw one person asking the chat
how many lots to use
on an asset um the answer is generally
up to five um usually what we do the way
our loads are calculated so for anyone
doesn't know
lod stands for level of detail it's
essentially another version of the
the match the the geometry that is
cheaper you know has fewer vertices or
fewer triangles
we basically we take the the average
size of the small triangles
and we say when that is a certain amount
of pixels on screen switch to the next
one
so it doesn't matter if your asset is
the size of a space station
or the size of a coffee cup once those
small triangles are
you know on in on the screen a certain
amount of pixels it'll say okay use the
next slot
so it's a really lovely scalable system
in a lot of game engines what you'll
have is
you'll dictate the distance that you
transition
transition to a lot like manually which
obviously when you've got many many
assets is a bit of a pain and it's just
like a really elegant system
here um usually what what i tend to do
is
um you've seen it before that that
basically you have the
the um parts of the weapon with the hard
edges
and and usually i leave that that parts
with hard edges
yeah that's it's a really low polygon
area
and and if you go to like a distance of
like 20 meter you can't tell the the
difference between
between it so if you're zooming out
the one without a lot is disappearing on
the right but
but with the lots you can't see a
difference
yeah um it's also worth noting that um
someone asked we do we do our laws
manually or do you do them
computer generated it's kind of it
depends on what the asset is uh
more organic assets you can get with
automation on weapons because they're so
dense we tend to
you know doing them by hand is quite
challenging so we tend to do i think
the first slot automatically and after
that we do it manually is that right
yeah that's that's how i tend to do it
because um
like it still has enough detail to
to usually look really similar to the
first one
if you do it automatically but after
that it the automatic the software
kind of doesn't know anymore uh how to
do it and this is like the lowest
version
where where it's just the basic shapes
and
it maybe doesn't look too good for you
now but
on a distance of like on it on a
distance of like
let's say 25 meter or like 50 meter you
can't tell the difference
with that lot it reminds me of halo on
the original xbox
yeah but but you need to realize we
don't have like unique textures so we
can't
still make it have the texture on it and
we all need to do everything with
polygons
and that looks like super like nintendo
64
style oh even the characters have lots i
haven't seen those
yeah i know we are exploring um we are
exploring more automated workflows for
um for lots using like houdini um
that's quite exciting it's i'm a bit of
a
i'm a bit of an automated skeptic
personally i think that human beings
for i i think for the foreseeable future
will be better at it than computers
obviously it's not it takes a long time
and it can be
it can be automated but the results
often are not as good
so you'll have more no like in in some
games you know you have more
more obvious popping you know when
you're moving away from an asset you
might see it like
deform wildly we try our best to make
our odds
unnoticeable and you know there there's
a lot to keep track of
yeah nice one did you steal that joke
from the chat
yes i stole it from don steeler i always
steal my money you're not getting away
from me man no
no no no i call i've called it out
before dawn steelers in chat every
every friday just to provide me with the
worst puns possible and i steal them
freely nice
good good steeler jared i think
can show off the uh wear and dirt as
well now because we've done quite a lot
of modeling
so we can show off yeah yeah we've got
like 15 minutes left jake
so um i thought we were gonna make a
weapon skin as well but that's gonna
have to wait for another one isn't it
all right oh yeah if time runs out we
can do it again of course
yeah weapon skin i really wanted jake to
make like a leopard print
weapon skin or something yeah i i once i
made one
that had like this leopard skin style
in pink and white and it still didn't
make the way into its game
i'm really disappointed i need to talk
to
i don't know producers why why this
didn't happen yet
yeah just uh just sneak it in one day
yeah so dynamic won't that's what jake's
kind of showing off now that's a big
part of our sort of
workflow this is one of the times we do
use
a unique texture per asset on weapons we
use unique
for a unique texture to generate this um
wear and dirt
essentially so the plan is in the future
for this to um be a consequence of
you know your i can't say when obviously
but
um you know your handling of the weapon
will affect its wear value essentially
um so to what degree i don't know i'd
you know but for now it's
something that we have a slider that we
can you know scale um
essentially we have a
texture for that where we have it's
split into the three channels of course
red green and blue that's how
um computers read textures um how they
display photos and stuff they have those
channels
um we used a red channel for wear the
green channel for dirt and the blue
channels for something called ambient
seclusion
which um you can kind of summarize as
when two things are close together they
tend to block out the light
you know so it's essentially just a way
of very cheaply kind of faking that
effect
um to kind of darken your cavities and
stuff so jake's been working on some
tools to kind of
help automate the process of generating
um these wear and dirt masks
yeah so um
using a blend map that corey was just
explaining at first
i try to make it within substance
designer and then i've got like an auto
generated one here and then i was
thinking like we could bring it into
substance painter have very specific
parameters that we could play around
with
but as i was like throwing on different
weapons
i found that if i just make it in
painter and then just bring them into
designer to export
it's a lot a lot simpler and often the
simpler
um answer is the best one and this way
it gives us a lot more
creative freedom so with these channels
here
i've tried to separate them out into red
green and blue but
with the red channel that's gonna be the
edgeware
so if i look at the weapon here
see that's like just the edges coming in
there that kind of silver
and then with the blue channel i've
tried to get this kind of peeling
uh metal effect so when you peel it off
you kind of get this different material
that comes in around it
just makes it feel a bit more grounded
as if the material is peeling off before
it gets to the layer underneath and then
with the green channel i've got
kind of a dirt generation
which works pretty well for just
creating kind of generic um
grime and dirt but a big question about
getting this to look good was like
how do we want our weapons to wear like
do we want to add rust
not really because let's say you've left
a weapon out in
like a planet that's like a desert
or something and you find it after like
um
months of playing and
it's completely rusty on a planet that
has no rain
it doesn't quite make any sense so we've
got to try and get it to look
generally grimy and beaten up like it's
had a hard life but it's not necessarily
like going to be seized up it's just
kind of
a bit be in you know over lubricated
kind of you know nasty but not you know
you know that's also something we talked
about that
we maybe in the future can like
depending on the planet you're on you
have different kinds of wear
and dirt and um that it's like if if
it's like a
planet where you have a lot of rain then
the wear
when it's now kind of a metal or
compound that you have under it
it can maybe change to a more rusty
version of it
so it kind of depends for now
this needs to be like usable
on basically every planet we have but in
the future the system
might change to to more complicated
system
we'll see we'll see we'll see about it
so i want this is one of those times
where i need to jump in there and be
like you know
you guys are you guys are working on the
art assets uh
to support the future development of a
system that will be created by engineers
and programmers
and systems designers so what can and
cannot be done and what will and won't
be done will be the preview of other
folks
but you are here building making sure
that all of your stuff is ready
and willing and able for when that time
comes
which is which is wonderful yeah
i saw someone ask about whether the
concepts artists are more responsible
for the
functionality of a weapon or whether
it's the developers or skies
um generally the the concept artists
will you know have a
pretty decent understanding of how the
weapon operates they will be
coordinating with
um you know designers and stuff for the
pre-production process
like how do we want this weapon to
behave what kind of features does it
have
all of that stuff kind of gets kept in
mind when a weapon's being you know
in the pre-production stage so when we
receive an asset
the challenges we face largely are okay
we have this
idea for a weapon it does x y and z it
has these functions
how do we make that work with dm game
systems you know how does it work with
the character rig
um how does it look scale and proportion
wise and so on you know we kind of
a lot of the legwork is done not
necessarily by the concept artists
themselves but in the pre-production
stage
there's a lot of discussion about the
functionality of a weapon
yeah and then we're kind of like okay
how do we how do we
realize the dream you know this stream
like of the concept artist
and you know design and and so on
obviously we're just one small facet of
the weapons pipeline
um you know weapons you know you have
audio vfx
animations um you know
the actual gameplay systems um
you know in terms of weapon damage and
balance and stuff we just made the thing
itself
you know what you know we don't
necessarily we have a lot of
you know talented and you know people
with
many many different skill sets kind of
who also contributes like
weapons as a feature we're kind of more
we're a part of weapons content but
weapons feature contains a lot more
um developers so we're kind of you know
we're kind of what's
we're downstream so to speak of some
departments
you know but we're also there's also
people who depend on our work
like animators um you know
audio and vfx they kind of need to see
the asset in game first
right you know so it's it's it's like a
multi-disc
multi-disciplinary you know sort of
thing
a there's a pipeline to it like just
about anything else
yeah is that another one for the star
citizen drinking game
nah i don't think no maybe not that one
i would say
what is it it's fidelity it's immersion
it's iterative uh scalable
that's that's getting there i don't
think that's there yeah maybe not
all right let's make that word bespoke
bespoke isn't the uh sony chats like
bespoke bespoke's not the uh star
citizen that's that's the that's the
jared drinking game i'm the one that
abuses that word
um uh what it's one of the chats we're
wrapping up here uh
are there any easter eggs on the weapons
you guys have made that you'd like to
to share
i've put my um sort of
name my abbreviated name in a few serial
numbers but that's pretty much the
most fun i've had i'm very pedestrian
when it comes to
um some people have snuck in uh
slightly more memes and uh things onto
decals and stuff
we try and um we don't want people to
see something that takes them out of the
game
because you know if you if you see a
decal that's got you know
some meme in it it's not you know you
know someone you know a developer has
put that in right
so it's kind of like you've got to be
careful about your easter eggs that are
not too immersion breaking i think yes
and also you know if someone sees them
and it's
you know a naughty easter egg you might
get in trouble so
yeah you also have to be aware not to
send folks on
uh uh random goose chases and stuff
because they think it's a
clue or something and some arg game and
it's actually just
the locker combination to your day that
you had in high school or something
yeah yeah it doesn't mean anything
sometimes serial numbers are
are just really really serial numbers
and don't have a meeting
meaning or something it's it's usually
they don't have a meeting
sometimes it's my my bank account number
corey i would think anybody else was
joking but with you i'm not entirely
certain
yeah if you know yeah you can clean that
one out if you find it
that's a joke 12 euros can be yours
yeah you could have one whole money
uh for modular weapon parts like uh
scopes and suppressors and stuff uh is
there a version
for for each uh is there a version of
each weapon for every configuration of
modules or are the models
in game uh actually modular wow
this this question goes around circles
yeah
yeah it's um so we have a a kind of an
item port system
so um we we place uh
helpers on on the weapons so um
you can yeah in this case you can
customize it and
um you have the points there the
attachment points where you can actually
put a different model so you can put a
laser pointer on it
uh and or like a flashlight
and uh yeah at the front and
not every weapon supports suppressors or
muscle breaks but in this case it works
because it's a ballistic
weapon but some weapons just are not
really
just too big or are not the kind of
weapons where you put
where you would put a silencer on so
uh algante uh yes you did see what you
see and you'll learn more about it
later in isc this quarter
someone asks what is your favorite hard
surface modelling technique and why is
it booleans
i think mine's actually splines i'm
known for my splines so everyone
everyone loves splines
and there's definitely blue booleans
brilliance i just like seeing it
great uh recently
uh we saw the inclusion of the lightning
bolt company uh with their sniper rifles
and pistols
uh what were the different challenges
that you faced when making those
you're very lucky because you have the
two guys who made the pistol sniper
rifle right here
oh yeah um oh yeah
[Music]
yeah it was
one of the more complicated weapons
because it's um
so for us if it's a static weapon we
just need to model it
it's it's always you know
straightforward we we know what we're
doing
just get the weapon
and uh and do it right but in this case
a lot of stuff is moving around it's
unfolding
you have like moving stuff rotating
stuff
all the little parts at the front the
round stuff is actually moving
and or is rotating out so
so yeah i would say that the more um
animates about a weapon the harder it is
for us to do
and the more we need to consider uh
actually
like how stuff behaves and and if it
like intersects like i said earlier
and yeah do you guys have a favorite
weapon that you've worked on
i've only made one so a couple of
squadron stuff
i don't know if i can talk about that
[Laughter]
mine is actually the shotgun um fairly
new to the weapon pipeline
and i've made that pistol and that smg
but the shotgun's the third one i've
made
and the fourth being this sniper rifle
but
this one was the most fun because i
think i
had a bit more control over it because
there were a lot of things that did have
to change
thanks to things clipping with the
animation
so for me that's why it was more fun
that's a great looking shotgun it did
i'm trying to think of what it reminds
me of but it it
it's definitely sparking a familiarity
with me that makes me
appreciate it a little bit more oh yeah
man thank you
i just can't right yeah i just the
entire show i've been trying to figure
out what it reminds me of that that
makes me like it so much
and i can't think of it
maybe it is a tommy gun maybe maybe it's
a 30th century version of atomic
although that would be a machine gun
not a shotgun but i don't i don't think
it's a tommy gun from the chat
uh let's see let's see if we have any
more questions before we let you go for
today
um let's see what else do we got here
someone said aa-12 which is another drum
fed
shotgun
lots of questions of course for the show
but uh folks remember
these are artists so if you're asking
about
uh bugs or or connection issues or some
these would not be the people who could
speak to that
um do you do you ever soften uh soften
or harden the normals of the geometry on
a on a per need basis or
or do you have like a set of guidelines
for
for the normals on the vertices um so
usually
what i tend to do is i try to have
everything soft and
um have like on all hard edges i have
the
um a chamfer or a bevel
so um yeah that's how i usually work
that that i don't leave a lot of hard
edges but of course sometimes you need
to do it for
certain reasons and then you can just um
select all the edges
harden them and and just leave them in
the state
yeah yeah in edge case for having
um a hard edge amongst custom normals is
when you've got like a super third and
face
or actually i can actually show with a
shotgun um
within here because this is super thin i
haven't actually beveled the edge
on the inside because it doesn't need to
be it's just a bit of spit like
where we can save some memory nice jared
yeah so uh we're we're about at the end
so
why don't you go ahead and stop the
screen share
and we'll uh wrap things up there i
think we're on the ranks yep
i'm on the wrong screen now i don't know
we're right so
uh yeah i was just i was showing you
this this is my weapon
i'm not uh toast doesn't let me fire it
in the house though so i can't show it
to you
i can't i can't show it uh not after the
eye incident
sounds very expensive trip to the
doctors hey
eyebrows grow back yeah the eye the eye
patch eyebrows grow back
so guys thank you so much for taking
time out of the end of your week to to
hang out with us
and uh you know show a bit of your
process um
we will we will absolutely bring you
back at some point to do the weapon skin
thing uh
there's always there's always oh that's
right toast is in the chat he's like i'm
not in the house
go ahead um so as we are want to do
uh we are not we are going to throw the
raid over to a star citizen streamer
who is broadcasting right now uh the
streamer today
uh is an oldie but a goodie it is dj
knight
uh dj knight who uh once once once took
me to a
an all-american pizza place in cologne
germany
uh that was just dominoes
it was just dominoes and we got all
excited we were like wow all american
new york pizza place in the middle of
germany yeah let's check it out
and i was it was just dominoes can you
say domino's first david
yeah so so guys we're starting up the
raid so you can opt in right now
uh when you're when you're uh when you
get there
tell them uh jared says what's up with
german dominoes dude
uh for star citizen live i'm jared i'm
jared that's jake
that's david that's corey and we'll see
you next week everybody take care
love you bye
you
