we have a lot of teams at cog
they all work in slightly different ways
so content teams work differently to
feature teams
but from playing the game and seeing how
you guys play the game it was clear that
it was not quite working for flight and
combat
so to rectify that we created the
vehicle experience team
we're kind of like a small kind of
specialist team so we've all kind of got
kind of core interests and that really
allows us to kind of provide good
feedback
the really heavy ifcs bug right and we
were like oh my god we fixed it we fixed
it it was like oh i heard it and i was
like oh my god we fixed this thing right
a lot of our other internal teams are
just dedicated to developing features so
they get the briefer feature they make
the feature they move on to the next
feature
we created some kind of basic designs
that allowed us the freedom just to
tackle them in a way that
it was more about trying to discover
what was wrong and how we could improve
it and how we could implement
it right basically this time so you know
that was kind of one of our goals was
just to improve the kind of core
experience
you don't know upfront what's going to
be fun right you have to experience
these things and so we kind of embrace
that kind of uncertainty now
so i'd say that the experimental kind of
sad so is how it's kind of plus the
minuses
this way of working with like rough
design goals
meant that we get very short iteration
loops and very
very short steps towards the the actual
combat experience that we want to have
as downside it does actually add to the
kind of timeline because we end up kind
of
putting time into things possibly we you
know we work ship as a feature
but you know overall we think that's a
better kind of process
so over the past few weeks we've kind of
been putting the final
tweaks on on the atmospheric flight and
the
source efficiency it hasn't been kind of
a smooth journey but we've been working
with the tech team to kind of
improve some of the problems we've
discovered along the way
so we want the atmospheric flight and
combat to feel completely different to
space flight in combat
it shouldn't just be the same model but
with some drag applied
you want to feel more like the the world
war ii
flight experience you want that combat
ranges in closer
you want it more visceral and you want
to have a more dynamic experience
a big challenge with the atmospheric
flight is the kind of wide range of
planets we have
so we've got a place like laurel where
you come in and you've got
like 60 000 feet of atmosphere to come
down
and if you're carrying like a now you
jump into that atmosphere you're really
gonna ask yourself
do you really want to do this because it
takes a lot of effort and a lot of
planning to kind of
land that ship correctly and then you've
got to take off and leave the atmosphere
so the shape of the ship and the wings
affect pretty much everything on the
ship handling and this is like
something that's really important to me
personally because now i can
i need to take care of my ship i cannot
just like
speed up and and hope that ifcs will
correct all the errors that i'm doing
with my piloting skills no
ifcs cannot over correct everything the
shape of the ship affects the lift and
drag these debug planes
we size them to either increase or
reduce the lift and drag
in any given axis and then that will
increase or decrease the maneuverability
of whatever axis you're traveling in it
gives the ships
a lot of characteristics so just to just
to say they're still
very controllable compared to like
planes or so but they're acting more
like planes
and this is like like this
it just feels real like you you you feel
the
you feel the air you're going through um
so in terms of like
atmospheric like the feeling just flying
over the atmosphere now or flying over a
planet
is immensely great now so these
aerodynamic changes what we're really
kind of going for is
the ability of ships to be different
which means if you've got an m50 it's a
racing ship it's a light ship you can
pull some really extreme g in the
corners but you can also pull some
really cool maneuvers
so when it comes to racing that's really
good to define kind of the race and
experience once we have racing on
planets
but also it's going to kind of take into
consideration some of the larger ships
and
just adjust the differences in
performance of these ships and how
the players compare them in atmosphere
you'll want to bring the right ship for
the job
with regards to planets if you've got a
supply mission
on a planet with thick atmospheric
density
to avoid any knocks or any turbulence
throwing your ship around
and potentially causing you to crash you
might want to bring a beefier heavier
ship
so you can have a more streamlined
journey to your destination
weather's going to play a big part in
how players approach atmospheric flight
as uh let's say you were on a microtech
with very strong winds
the wind is going to blow your ship in
certain directions
and you're going to want to counteract
that but it also means that as you're
flying
these forces are going to change how you
control your ship
so you might do a sharp right turn and
then the wind slightly overcooks it
meaning you'll crash if you're not
careful
if you crash or damage your ship or
a rather managed to take out one of your
thrusters it's really going to pull
in one direction and as a player you've
got to counteract that so you've got to
try and counter balance and missing
thruster
if you lose like a main thruster and the
ship's got two you're gonna have to pull
the ship slightly in one direction to
still move forwards
so in terms of like feel of flight this
is a massive step which really really
excites me
so we want combat in star citizen to be
a varied experience we don't want there
to be just a single way to win we don't
want people to be
min-maxing stats we don't want people to
just rely on alpha strikes
and that really promotes player choice
over just ship selection and item
selection
so with everything being a lot closer
and more dynamic and hectic
we needed to do some improvements to how
targeting works
we're moving towards a more look-based
targeting system than an aim-based one
you can use head tracking or you can use
free look to look at different targets
and
scan around the around your space and
see
which ones are most interesting to you
and then when you've found one you can
either
lock it or you can pin it and locking it
is uh effectively it has the gives all
the combat information available to you
that you would expect
so you get shields you get targeting
pips you get
mfds you can only have one of these at a
time but you will need
additional targets that you might want
to care about you know friendly targets
or
enemies that you might want to deal with
later things like this that's what pins
targets are for
pinning is something that we had in the
early arena commander patches and which
was lost over time
because of the uh maintenance overhead
of the old ui tag
so with the new ui technology the
building blocks we can bring pinning
back
though we will have them in a somewhat
different format than we had before
the main aspect of pinning is that you
can persistently
target something and share it with your
crew
so it's not finished right we also want
to have something like
pinning shared with other with other
ships and all that
but that of course will have to happen
in later releases for now we have a
solid first step which we can iterate
easily on
so if a pilot pins a target the turret
is going to see what this target is
and they can then talk about it and
coordinate their attacks based on that
one thing that we learned in the past is
that
you cannot ship a new feature if you do
not have appropriate ui support
so for the turrets we created a very
bare bone ui
that turret ui will tell you exactly
where turret is pointing
it will tell you about the state of the
turret it will tell you what kind of
like
modes on the turret you have enabled for
example combined versus staggered fire
turrets are now a threat they deal
damage
and so players are really going to have
to reconsider how they might have
approached combat scenarios
the new turret system allows multi crew
to be
more viable in game play we added a
thing called fixed assist
and this is not just for the turrets
it's also for the fixed weapons
it takes an angular offset between your
current aim
and the aim direction of your target and
then
based on that ratio and if you are
within certain thresholds it nudges your
bullets
a bit towards the target as for the
control method
we're included a v joy star control
scheme
which is the same that we're using in
ships so um
you have you're gonna have like a v-joy
cursor on your
around your crosshair of the turrets and
by slaving that
veto around your turret will follow the
motion
we also added a velocity limiter so
with your mouse wheel just like in any
other situation the game you can
adapt your your velocity and the turrets
that would be the rotational velocity
and um this hookup with all the axis
bindings makes makes actually quite nice
to control turrets with
a with a hotels as well so you can just
have like your left hand on your on your
throttle
which is then just controlling the
turret speed where and
with the rest you just control the
turret direction so in the past it was
quite easy for a group of
uh small fighters to be able to kind of
overrun one of the larger ships despite
its many turrets available
whereas now you might find that you're a
little more careful you're a little more
considerate
and maybe try and talk about your combat
scenario before
engaging a large ship yeah it's got one
two more guys going
one more you're nearly done nearly
what's going to be
you did it yay there we go
yeah so the changes in 310 are the next
step in the flight and combat experience
they're not the first and they
definitely won't be the last
we don't want there to be a single way
of just winning combat no matter what
we don't want dps races or min maxing
stats
we want you as a player to have as much
influence over the outcome of combat
as the ship you've selected we know some
players embrace change a lot and some
are very scared of it but we do
encourage
everyone to get in game and test it out
for yourselves we're really excited for
these changes for star citizen
and we look forward to seeing what you
do with them
the way that ships fly and fight their
way through space and atmosphere alike
is at the heart of the star citizen and
squadron 42 experiences
and as john said these changes for alpha
3.10
are the next step in that continuing
evolution for both
if you'd like to learn more about what's
happening you can check out the conlink
that's currently available now
on the robertsspaceindustries.com
website as well as keep an eye out for
when wider ptu testing becomes available
for all
so that you can get in and try it
yourself with that
we'd like to bring this quarterly season
of isc to a close
but before we let you go for the next
few weeks we wanted to
try something new and run down some of
the features fixtures and fixes coming
your way in the upcoming alpha 3.10
in a new segment we're creatively
referring to as
the patch report let's get to it in no
particular order we've got
vehicle impounding where different
infractions can have various
fines and durations meaning lighter
penalties for blocking pads
and a longer duration forfeiture for
crimes like pad ramming
also players lingering over landing
areas without permission
should now see a countdown timer warning
them of imminent impounding
should they not withdraw delivery
mission improvements
where alpha 3.10 begins the process of a
complete
overhaul to the way they work starting
with local deliveries which now have
multiple pickup and drop-off locations
of course there's also a new drug
delivery mission for those who enjoy
visiting
the darker corners of the verse
vehicle paint schemes are coming to
vendors throughout the stanton system
allowing players to personalize the look
and feel of your vehicles
for auc earned in-game
electron damage weapons like the axe cap
sniper rifle and uberoff pistol
bring an electric new way to take out
your enemies outside of their
ships and vehicles body dragging will
allow
unconscious or deceased characters to be
dragged around the environment by other
players
and i'm certain won't make for some
amusing videos from the community
restricted areas v2 where we've finally
done away with the last remnants of the
ugly red areas
and implemented a new spline based
landing system
that will help guide pilots to their
correct destination and away from
places they shouldn't be going
new thruster efficiency curves that
lower the strength of thrusters in
atmosphere depending on the thickness of
the air
which then in turn feeds into a complete
overhaul of vehicle aerodynamics you
just heard about
high-speed combat changes designed to
bring your opponents in closer
by slowing the slew rate of gimballed
weapons and the lock-on time for
missiles at top speeds
encouraging a more engaging combat
experience
new targeting methodology that should
help players better find and keep track
of their targets
turret improvements which bring a new
control scheme to bear that pilot should
already be familiar with
in an effort to make riding passenger
and multi-crew ships
more fun and exciting
ai improvements like cover usage shotgun
assault tactics
and a better sense of when to move and
hold position all aim to make fps
engagements with non-player characters
more dynamic and interesting than ever
before
visual improvements to the m50 and
balance changes to the cartoon wall
mean there's something new to look
forward to for owners of these speedy
and nimble spacecraft respectively
grimhex is getting a new shop new
hangars and a new viewing area to
support the future release of scramble
races
not to be left out new babbage is
getting hangers and perhaps a more
impressive new shop of their own
with the upcoming factory line in its
new array of moby glass variants players
can purchase
then the various planets and moons all
throughout the stanton system
are seeing the return of outposts
derelicts and caves that were lost after
the conversion of planet tech v4
but now with improved lighting exterior
dressing and
protection from the weather elements
outside
i feel like i'm leaving something out i
mean sure we didn't cover
everything that's in the upcoming alpha
3.10 but
there's something else i'm sure you'll
figure it out
uh for another quarterly season of
inside star citizen
i'm your host jared huckabee thank you
for watching thank you for playing
and we'll see you all next month
you
