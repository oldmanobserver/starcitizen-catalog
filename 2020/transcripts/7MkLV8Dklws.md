## Transcript

uh hi everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live game dev
let there be light i'm your host jared
huckabee and if you've never seen star
citizen live before
that's where we take about an hour out
of our fridays at the end of our week
and we goof off sometimes we answer some
questions
sometimes we review some process uh
sometimes we sit down with
one of our developers and we let we let
them
take us on a guided tour of their work
and when that happens we call those
episodes
our game dev episodes and that's what
we're doing this week joining us on the
show this week
is an esteemed guest from our lighting
team mr chris campbell chris
how you doing hey good thanks jared how
are you this morning
i'm all right uh thank you for agreeing
to take the time
out of your of every busy schedule as
we're heading into the
the the the final furlough of alpha
three
one here uh i know or three three three
one one
i did it three one takes me back yeah do
i look like i know what year it is
it's the time is 2018 we're pretty
uh as we're approached three eleven uh
what are we doing today you are you are
of course a uh uh
what is it lead lighting yeah i'm
grounded
artist for the persistent universe all
right and what are we what are we doing
today
uh so i just thought we would do like a
quick kind of
re-light ish of a surface outpost on
hurston okay and and
and the purpose of this is to is to kind
of show us a little bit about your
process what goes into it uh
you you know we've had a lot of talks
offline uh lighting is something
is one of the lighting and sound are two
of my
little uh pet projects with with game
development because i i think there's a
lot of misconceptions out there about
what goes into it uh
what makes good or effective lighting
and stuff like that so um
so we're gonna explore some of that
process today uh
if you want you're the driver on the
passenger today so you can start your
screen share
and we'll just jump right into it okay
share that there all right so yeah i
mean i'll try and keep uh
keep some of the boring technicalities
out of it and focus on kind of
making something cool and uh yeah just
going through kind of my process of
exploring a space and uh and kind of
figuring out something to do with it so
so yeah i've basically got this uh
this little habitation outpost which
i've put on hurston
um i've got access to the the sun time
of day so i can quickly and easily
change the time of day which is going to
be useful um but of course everyone
loves a good sunset so we can
we can start off there i think um does
it ever make you just feel powerful just
being able to grab the sun like that and
just be like oh
i wish i could do that in real life just
make it sunset all day long
right so yeah uh just to start with this
is this is kind of
what what everyone should already know
from
from the insides of these um these
habitation units
uh and so what i've done is i've done
like a kind of very rough quick
redressing pass mostly just because
uh without it you know the lighting's
very functional it's all kind of
built into the um the structure
uh and while there's there's a lot you
can do when you're kind of
building a space like this you can kind
of design the lighting to fit in
nice and neatly but since we're going to
go a little bit crazy
having a bit more freedom and a little
bit more uh
places and locations where we can kind
of throw lights and
cast weird shadows and stuff like that
um yeah
this is a this is going to be a good
starting point all right so it's a
oh then you you just turn on a layer or
whatever so
this you started with the base model uh
rayari
hab and then before the stream here
you've spent some time redressing this
yes yeah exactly i it's a maybe a little
bit of cheating but i don't think anyone
wants to watch me do
horrible environment art dressing work
uh i'll leave that to the
the pros in that department that's going
to say has this been validated by the
environment
yeah no they know you're going rogue
apologies to ian
for destroying his happier okay
uh cool so um i'll basically i'll turn
off
what's already there um and we'll kind
of kick it off
from there so that's the the old lights
now gone
uh what i will do is i'll keep all the
cube maps because i think again that's
kind of
i mean it's a it's a very critical part
of the job is kind of laying out cube
maps for the best ambient lighting
but uh no one wants to watch me do that
for an hour as well so
i'll use the existing cube maps well
let's go ahead and
talk a little bit about what a cube map
is though because the q map
is incredibly important to lighting in
the lumberyard engine
so just introduce us to the concept of
qmaps
yeah sure so the cube map is um or the
environment probe is kind of the the
absolute fundamental
part of our lighting kind of workflow
so all without it you know we've just
got basically a pitch black interior
um it's pitch black because it's all
interior and hidden away using visit
areas and stuff which basically means
that you start from
absolutely zero lighting uh and what a
an environment probe does
is you kind of place a um
kind of like an area of effect in this
case these are all kind of cubes
and with a little bit of softness on
them and
and what they do is they they capture
what's called a cube map which is just
like a a texture which
is captured from like uh imagine that
each one of these has like a little
camera pointed in all six directions of
the cube
it takes a screenshot and then
reprojects that ambient light
into all four directions so the more
that you have
theoretically the more detail you can
get in your ambient lighting
um these are generally approximations
uh so i mean for example like on this
side
um of of this uh bed over here
it's actually receiving the light from
this cube map
um so if i turn that one off then
it gets more lighting from this cube map
and and vice versa so
yeah i don't know i'm sorry chat i i
want to say that i i see your puns
and they are sustaining me keep them
going
um so that that's what a cube map is but
why do we need cube maps why is this the
is is why are cube maps necessary
well without them and unfortunately
still
still not having any kind of rage racing
or something like that
um you need ambient lighting in the game
uh you know a long time ago uh you would
just have kind of a
consistent ambient value which would be
like some kind of gray or blue or
taken from the sky color so some kind of
orange
and that would just be projected
throughout the entire world
in kind of a uniform way but cube maps
allow us to uh kind of
account for um occlusion based on
like the window for example uh or the
ceiling or the floor which makes things
then appear darker
which gives you more um uh depth of
contrast between like the interior which
is nice and dark here versus the
exterior
uh out there okay yeah
and the the brighter it gets outside i
i'm not sure how easily some of this
will pick up on stream
but the brighter gets on the outside uh
the cube maps will recapture
uh and then you'll get like even more
kind of light spilling in
so if we don't have any lights at all uh
you get already this kind of nice
bass ambient lighting um
look yeah and
if you want to actually see the cube
maps i can turn on like this little
uh debug mode and i'll turn off the
screen space reflections
so this is basically like all of the cur
all of the materials have just turned
into like a
a glossy kind of like a chrome mirror
for example
and this shows you what each of the cube
maps kind of reflection maps are picking
up
so obviously towards the the windows
you're getting a lot of this
exterior lighting and that's getting uh
reprojected in
into the the room so when i turn it back
on uh you can see like these highlights
coming in
uh on the the more reflective surfaces
and this is without any additional
lighting whatsoever this is just the
base kind of ambience
nice all right yeah so that's that's
where we'll start
so we know like the so we know one of
the
the current hotness and video cards
anything is ray tracing
yeah and stuff like that but not
everybody will have a card that's
capable of doing ray tracing
exactly i mean it's it's an extremely
intensive
graphically heavy process
and i think it's it's still a ways out
for
a lot of game development um but
obviously something that we we want to
explore
at some point for sure only we will have
a couple unique challenges we'll have to
figure out how it works with a 360
degree
fully realized planet and exactly all
that stuff so we
will have some challenges maybe some
other folks may not but it's definitely
something that we're
we intend to pursue yeah yeah exactly
but in the meantime environment probes
in the meantime
we've got cube maps and environment
probes and uh that's
you know that's that's good enough for
like kind of 95 percent of cases
cool so yeah so i apologize for
derailing you
you no that's that's totally fine um
derail away
uh okay so i find the topic very
illuminating
i totally stole that from chat
yeah so i mean uh i i don't know i don't
know if
it's probably just me but i already
really like uh looking at scenes where
there are
there's no lighting and it's basically
just simulations of the
um the exterior lighting kind of
bouncing around in an interior i always
think that looks really cool you get
lots of nice
reflections and stuff like that so uh
you'll have to forgive me if i i might
noodle around a bit and just kind of
look at certain angles
um but that's also kind of part of the
lighting process is
like finding good kind of i guess what
we would call like screenshot
moments where you find like a nice kind
of uh
a nice kind of framing um with like some
nice dark spots some nice lighting spots
uh and then we can kind of build from
there so like uh yeah like here for
example
you get some nice spill through here
it's getting a little bit dark over
there
and so maybe we'll we can start adding
some light back there and just see what
happens
yeah by all means you do you alrighty
you just tell us what you're doing
all right i'm gonna add a light
there we go and we're done so
that's uh that's lighting for you
uh so uh obviously
just adding in a light by default just
gives me a nice kind of white
very boring light by itself
but obviously you want to see what
you're doing so um
i mean a lot of people may notice where
some of these props come from
uh when i was building this uh this
dressing i was kind of thinking it's
maybe
some guy who works in lowerville uh and
he's kind of a little bit fed up of the
hurstons and he's maybe stolen some
stuff
uh from lorville and he's brought it out
to his little drug stash
he stole some pictures of he stole
pictures of the people that he hates and
hung them on as well he broke in there
and then he wants to you know
graffiti them up a little bit all right
again apologies to the environment art
team
no no we're just learning more about you
than anything else yeah right
all right so i'm gonna start with uh
maybe
like these these props already have uh
some light fixtures built into them
um so i think what could be cool to
start with is just like some little kind
of dim
i don't know lighting or information
over here uh just to
make it a little bit less flat i'm gonna
turn this guy on
let's start with a nice dim
kind of intensity i'm going to
link the light to the picture frame
which then uh
so each uh each asset or material can
have like a glow
assigned to it and that can sometimes be
controlled by a light source once we
link it to it
and then let's make this a projector
light
and we'll give it just a simple
kind of projection
widen it up a little bit and we're off
to
our start
[Music]
so that's kind of cool
it's just a little bit uh horror movie
desk like kind of the the pictures
following you along the wall uh let's go
with something a little bit
warmer in color maybe
i think this guy's a little bit sick so
we'll use a lot of like kind of greenish
greenish yellows and stuff like that
reduce the radius because we're always
thinking about performance
let's expand it a little bit let's make
it a little bit brighter
you mentioned performance very casually
there
but it's there's always got to be this
ever looming
shadow this presence over everything you
do where
yeah it's you have to resist the urge to
go
hog wild or crazy but at the same time
one of the tenants of star citizen is
always pushing
the envelope as they say you know as far
as we can how do you balance that
exactly i mean yeah as you say we're
we're certainly not
shying away from expensive uh lighting
setups and
and you know kind of pushing the
boundaries there um
but at the same time um yeah obviously
we wanna we want people to be able to
run the game uh at a somewhat decent
frame rate
uh so when we're when we're building our
lighting
uh for environments we always just try
and keep it in the back of our mind like
some rough guidelines of
how many lights we can use uh how many
shadow casting lights we can use
and how many lights are overlapping in
the scene at any given moment
and those are just kind of things that
we um we you feel out
as you as you work on the project a
little bit more
um so i've got some some numbers in my
head
um and uh yeah it's just
it's more a habit at this point so i
just kind of
try and stick with it i don't want to
you know
reveal too much of the magician's
secrets but yeah
you you mention it shadow casting lights
uh
the existing of a shadow casting light
implies the existence of lights that
don't cast
shadows yes exactly
um yeah so for example i mean
you know especially for demonstration
purposes we want it to look as good as
possible so i'm turning on shadows quite
often
um but probably probably i guess like 80
of the lights that we're placing
generally don't cast shadows and
uh the the basic kind of thought process
there is that if it's
if it's some kind of uh ambient light or
it's just kind of acting as a fill for
the environment
uh you don't always need to have shadows
turned on so like for example
um let's say that this was quite bright
let's make it a little bit brighter
um and this is again like kind of one of
those things where when you don't have
ray tracing
um and the kind of methods that offline
renderers use you have to kind of
fake a lot of things um so in this
example like there's no bounce light
coming from this uh
this light here hitting the floor and
then like shining back up
you know if i turn it off and on there's
no difference in this uh
this part of the frame right so what
we'll do sometimes is we'll add like a
kind of a bounce light
uh or a fill kind of light
and in this case i'll just extend the
bulb a little bit
so it's a bit softer i'm kind of
thinking that i want the light source to
be
about as big as the um
the cone of this light hitting this uh
this pile of dirty laundry on the floor
so i'll bring that down to about there
and then
lighting is is pretty much all about
ratios so it's all about
how bright is your key light and then
how bright are the subsequent bounce and
fill lights and that kind of stuff to
create
contrast uh in your scene so right now
this this fill light is just way too
bright
so i'd bring that way down and even more
than that
probably even more than that and so now
it's very subtle
but it just adds a little bit of that
kind of greenish uh light kind of
bouncing up into the ceiling
and uh and against these these areas
uh and this light because it's so subtle
in the grand scheme of things it doesn't
need shadow casting to go back to your
initial point
so key lights shadow casting fill lights
no shadow casting
[Music]
it it's always a hard balance because
yeah
in an ideal situation of course every
single light would be shadow casting and
and ray tracing would be on everything
and
you know you obviously you you want you
want to push these things as far as
possible but
the performance performance is and
optimization is such an important
consideration
these things you always you take you
take it to the point of looking awesome
and then
you often have to scale it back uh you
know by
degrees to get to the point where it's
performative
yeah yeah exactly i mean obviously we
we try and replicate the real world as
much as possible and
you know in the real life in the real
world i'm not sure i've i've heard of a
light source that doesn't cast shadows
um that would be interesting um
so that's that's obviously the goal but
then the
the realities of kind of computer
graphics uh tends to get in the way of
that sometimes
all right so
uh yeah i'm i'm basically just like kind
of putting in
whatever i feel is going to kind of help
the scene
so one thing that i like to always try
and add is a little bit of movement
in the lighting um
that also it helps especially in our
engine like
a lot of other engines use baked
uh lighting which then tends to be very
static and you know once it's baked
that's kind of how it looks
um but our engine is and always has been
like purely dynamic
uh the only thing that is baked would be
kind of these cube maps uh and even then
we
we update and refresh those every now
and then um
so it's always nice to
to make the most out of that uh those
dynamic lights by
you know making the move around or
adding a little bit of uh
extra animation and stuff like that to
kind of help it out
right you're talking about the uh the
recently updated uh runtime
probes yes yeah exactly so all of these
probes are
are set to be runtime so i'm not
manually rebaking them
but i do sometimes will i'll just select
them all and then kind of hit refresh to
force them to update
in case they're not updating fast enough
for my tastes
so i'm going to create another weight
uh from the chat uh what is the exposure
control
in a scene if you brighten it up a few
stops uh does it change the scene much
do we control exposure um we
uh from it on an artist's perspective we
don't control the exposure itself
directly
uh we kind of we control the exposure
through
how bright we make our lighting
and in the background we have this kind
of auto exposure system
uh which you know has like a maximum
brightness range and a darkness
uh range and then it kind of you know
tries to strike a balance in between
so i've got these buttons up here which
will let me kind of force the exposure
to a certain
um almost kind of like an f-stop but
it's actually it's an ev value and an
exposure value
so like this for example i've got it
locked to an ev of 10
which works fine kind of outside
and then you know once you get inside
the the darker areas start getting
really really dark
uh almost pitch black and so without it
um the auto exposure can kind of kick in
and then lift those areas
uh and that's kind of how you get like
kind of blown out
um and then um
you know when you're outside looking in
then you'd get kind of like
darker looking interiors from a distance
until you kind of enter them so that's
kind of how we work with our dynamic
range
but we don't actually have any
individual control like say if i wanted
this room specifically to be a certain
exposure brightness i i don't have that
control
which is fine because we have so many
locations in our game
having that extra level of control just
means more time tweaking
it more more opportunities for bugs to
appear that kind of stuff
i know star citizen and lumberyard
support uh hdr
how does that how does that affect your
work
um like uh hdr
monitors or yeah i like your like high
dynamic range monitors and stuff does
that
does that do that play a factor in how
you light a scene
um not so much actually i uh the
the hdr um system is kind of like a it's
a back end
kind of a graphics uh system which will
um
i mean i can't i don't know the tactical
so you'd have to ask someone like ali
yeah um but uh basically it's all kind
of uh
behind the scenes so it takes whatever
we've lit and then it
you know pushes things in certain in
certain directions to uh to work for hdr
so i mean another kind of thing that i
do
when i am lighting a scene is
uh i mean one of the kind of things that
um that ian really likes as
our environment art director um is he
likes
lots of like kind of low angle glancing
lights um and this this comes from you
know a lot of the art direction of our
game comes from
roger deakins and uh um
uh james cameron uh you know aliens and
that kind of stuff uh kind of 80s
90s sci-fi movies
and you know it's in cinematics and
movies you've always got
very low lights you've always got lots
of like specular highlights and stuff
like that
and so sometimes when i'm i'm looking to
start lighting a scene i'll just kind of
place a light
and just kind of look around for again
kind of looking for those moments where
i can see like
you know like oh maybe i really like how
the light pings off this uh this locker
here
and gives me a nice hot spot down there
and then when i find a spot where i like
the light
then i'll try and find a way to motivate
it either by adding a light fixture
there
or you know something glowing or some
reason for the light to be there
because generally we we want to minimize
how many lights just exist in the world
but don't actually have a source right i
was i was actually going to be my next
question
uh we started this by start working with
one of the lights that were already
there in the scene
with the light that was uh embedded at
the top of the picture frame
but yeah as you work and as you go
through
my next question was how many times do
you have to
do do you have to go back to the
environment artist or the prop
artists and ask for a light here or
there so that so that you can
motivate your uh design decisions
yeah that that's uh that's usually
something that we try and do
um as early in the process as possible
so like the environment our team will
will block
out a location um and then we'll we'll
come in and set up our cube maps and all
the kind of
technical basics um and at the same time
try and think about where we want our
key lights to come from and
if we need to request any changes to the
geometry or
or the layout to accompany that um then
that's that's usually the best time to
do it
um because uh later on when art starts
getting final it's uh
it gets a little a little tight to
request these kind of changes
right so i kind of like where this uh
this light is here um i'm going to
give it a light fixture uh and i'm just
going to fly down
to i kind of got a an asset zoo
under the planet of all of the lighting
fixtures that we tend to use
in the game um this actually exists
under the planets in the in the
precision universe too guys
if you oh yeah you can find it if
sometimes if you
fall through the planet at the right
place you can find our acid zoos
so this is a guy i like to use often
so i'll basically just i i'm kidding
about that don't don't tell ian i said
that
yeah this absolutely does not exist in
the in the game
i'd be in a lot of trouble i get an
email from me and did you did you tell
people we left lights under the planet
here we go and now i've got it kind of
just roughly rotated
and then i'm gonna
there we go that's not to say sometimes
there's not something left under the
planet an accident that has happened
that does happen well you know it does
happen
completely unintentionally where they
shouldn't spawn yeah
that happens in almost every video game
you just find a
random asset somewhere where it's not
supposed to be and it's like oops
yeah but that's sometimes that's part of
the fun is finding something that
shouldn't be there
[Music]
so uh so yeah i mean one other thing
like why i'm in this uh this kind of
debug view
um as a lighting artist you're often
working in extremely dark
locations and you know if you're trying
to it would be like in real life trying
to like put a light source
while you're staring directly at it and
figuring out where it goes against the
wall
uh so sometimes i just turn on this um
this debug that just uh removes all
lighting information and just shows me
the
the albedo textures and then i can see
where i want to actually place my my
light source
do you know what albedo means
oh that's uh you're putting me on the
spot there i mean i i know roughly what
i don't know what the the origin of the
word is i assume it's really latin or
something all right
i've asked this question on three
different shows where it's come up like
this and nobody's had the answer
so it's just a curiosity i know but i'm
not going to tell you
okay right i mean it's uh i mean the
albedo itself is like the
um it's like an index for how much light
a as a material reflects
uh from its surface all right there you
go
but the word itself i don't know
alrighty
so we've got this guy and again like uh
it's it's very dark back up in the
corners and you'd expect
some level of bounce i think having this
hit down here so i'm gonna go ahead and
just add a
a simple kind of uh bounce light and see
see where we go
with that and a lot of lighting uh just
ends up being
quite a bit of like trial and error and
just figuring stuff out
the more you do it then you kind of get
a feeling
for what is more likely to work than not
um but there's there's still a lot of
kind of exploration
that goes into it so there we go so now
we've got like some nice kind of
highlights up here
filling out the room a little bit more
without it it's
it's a little bit too contrasty
then uh yeah it's always good good idea
to remember to like refresh the probes
because they will
the more light you add the more light
gets picked up by the probes and then
once the probes get recalculated the
scene gets brighter
and then maybe that's too bright and
then you you have to kind of balance the
lighting back and forth
that's a lot of balancing acts but it
actually looks kind of cool from this uh
this side as well
um earlier in the show you said you had
some numbers in your head
uh we were talking about performance uh
is there anything you could you can
share the questions that was coming from
the chat is
was asking if you had a percentage
quotient that you that you that you aim
for when doing something like this
sure uh i mean in terms of uh lights
that we have on screen our general
rule of thumb is to keep it around
well not around but under like 280
lights
on screen at any given moment and you
may
think that that's like a lot and how
would you ever get to that kind of
number
um but i mean especially in a sci-fi
game almost
all light sources are man-made light
sources
and you've got spaceships which all have
lights
built into them and you've got players
running around with their flashlights
and all of these kind of things add up
to that that total
so we actually we hit that limit
frequently
and uh and we hit it hard
so i'm gonna counteract the blue from
this light i'm just gonna make this one
a warmer color instead
if i was coming in here i'd want my my
three identical
jumpsuits to uh to be the main focus
here
so i'll just angle it a little bit more
towards on the uh the suits themselves
and when you said a 180 lights it was
180 right
let's just say uh 200 200 200 so you
said 208 lights
that's on screen at any one time so
that's not even like in a scene it's
just
wherever exactly this person can look in
this camera frame so like there could be
another 280 lights behind me but
as long as it's only in the in the frame
and that's kind of good
um so yeah i mean some
some environments like big city
locations and stuff
you know the total number of lights in
that location could easily exceed
like a thousand or two thousand um
lights that we actually end up placing
and then we we use as many tricks as we
can to kind of keep that number down
per frame um yeah
we got those guys
all right cool uh just as i'm just going
to offer a correction to some
things i'm saying in chat rtx was not
answered as
no we do not have retracing in right now
uh it is something that we want to
investigate and explore
in the future so yeah there
there was not a no to ray tracing as i'm
seeing some people in chat
uh regurgitate it's just
on the list and there are other
priorities ahead of it that's all
exactly i mean again i don't want to
i don't want to step on ali's shoes too
much here but um
you know before we even start talking
about ray tracing we have to get the gen
12 renderer
um up and running and that's kind of the
main priority i think for the graphics
team
just like all things the game
development priorities he can't
fortunately we can't work on everything
all at the same time
exactly i'm going to try and find
something else to use here
[Music]
thinking i'm thinking of something for
his desk so i want like a
i know like a desk light i guess
so let's see if we got something in here
jeez um i'm just gonna
i'm gonna improvise a little bit i'm
sure there's some props artists that's
like
yeah i've made 300 different light
fixtures yeah exactly
um yeah but if they don't tell us that
they made it then
then i don't know it exists
[Music]
okay he's looking kind of bright in here
that's
that's a bit of a worry let's not use
him
um
[Music]
where do we keep the well this kind of
looks like a desk light let's use that
but yeah we we certainly have a a lot of
uh
props in this game it can be very
daunting trying to look through them
for something oops
i'm gonna put this in here there we go
i'm just going to create a new light
[Music]
put it up here link it
that linked let me see no
select oh there it is okay
all right same process and
add a texture let's use something a
little bit different now
let's go with this one
and of course it's slightly offset which
makes my
my life a little bit harder so now i
have to manually kind of
drag it into place
so about all about finding the right
camera angle to
move something five centimeters
all right that's that there let's
lighten it up let's turn on the shadows
link the light to the actual um mesh
itself and then i can like drag them
around together
and find a decent kind of position for
it
we've had some questions about the uh
aspect ratio you're working in
this looks like what 21.9 uh
yeah something like that it's um it's an
ultra wide
uh asus predator
you're not getting paid don't do that
uh i'll i'll take my check now asus
uh is that just is there an advantage
for your workflow to work in a
ultra wide or is it just something you
like um
initially i like when i first got it it
took a little bit of time to kind of get
used to
having such like a wide screen because i
like having more vertical space as well
like especially when you start
having like all these properties to
adjust um you can never have enough
vertical space
but the more that i've worked with it
definitely
um it's absolutely awesome for having
just like a massive
viewport that you can work with um and
at the same time like
uh you know the more cinematic you want
to get obviously the wider
the screen and then it it just makes it
really easy to like get those kind of
cinematic angles
uh and and wide kind of letterbox uh
moments
um so that's good but definitely what
helps more is a second monitor which uh
is not being shared at the moment where
i've got like it's just toolbars and uh
and other kind of tool windows
would be impossible without a second
monitor for sure
okay every time you go back to this
section i just
think about how we should open up like
the like a lamps plus
store in reverse that would be good
it's a chain we have here in the states
a story that just sells nothing but
lights
i'd be done with that
at least they did in the 80s and early
90s i don't know if they're still around
anymore
yeah hey lamps plus if you're still
around where's my check
so i'm gonna make this it's like
basically
coming out of this this guy
this would uh this could be a good
excuse to actually use one of our planar
lights
so we do have um
slash area lights uh in the engine
um they're more expensive than normal
lights so we can't use too many of them
um they're also they don't cast area
shadows
which is a a bit of a limitation so
we try to only use them in in areas
where
it would be really noticeable if the
specular highlight wasn't the shape of
the
the light fixture itself
so i'll try and see if it if it makes
sense for this spot here
i'm going to turn off the shadows
because you can see you start getting
like some really weird
artifacts
so let's turn that guy off
that's kind of cool because now the the
reflection kind of matches up with um
with the light source itself yeah
i spent 30 seconds trying to come up
with a joke about
the light being playing and i i didn't
[ __ ] do it
you can make it nice and boring a boring
white light
i'm just off i'm off today
and chat with you yet chad wasn't there
to help me
all right so i think by itself this
light's not
not quite doing it for me um
so you can see like what i what i'm kind
of looking for here is again
always trying to like pick out certain
materials uh
and i'm getting like a little bit of
light on the tops of these of this uh
kind of leather chair but i just want to
add another light
a little bit higher up kind of angled a
little bit more down on this guy
that's gonna that's gonna give me what i
want
and i'll try and position it so that i
don't see like
like an extra specular highlight
[Music]
and in this case i can add a little bit
of shadows as well
yeah there we go now if someone was
sitting there
they would look pretty cool
um all righty what else we're going to
do
20 minutes left wow this is uh
not going as fast well maybe it just
took a lot longer when i was setting
this up initially
um no that's okay it's one of the
reality is every time we do this
every time we do one of these shows it's
work does not happen
on an hour by hour basis there's very
few things in game development you can
complete
uh in an hour nice and tidy in an hour
but it i can do like maybe one of those
cooking shows and here's one i prepared
earlier kind of moments
but uh i think that maybe maybe that's
kind of cool and then we'll we can spend
a bit of time
looking at like a night time i'll do
some some character lighting
on this guy here um as i said he's very
untrustworthy of people
coming by his uh his little shack so
he's prepared
and got a pistol as well i know the
other thing i really i was proud of this
he like he stole some of the transit
signs from louisville
and brought them back to his place i'm
gonna get a letter from the environment
art team
yeah there's a lot of things here that
should not be
in the same location all right so i'm
just gonna turn on the
the stuff that i had done kind of last
time and i'll just run through
a little bit of what i was looking at so
again like kind of finding areas um
in the location where there's like some
interesting props or
opportunities to add a little bit of
kind of life
um so i thought having some like broken
broken lights hanging over by
his t-shirts would be kind of cool um i
get a lot of
inspiration from um erica gagnon
who's the the art director from uh deus
ex of the new
deus ex games and um we like to kind of
do some kind of like light sculptures uh
in a similar kind of way that he's uh
that he's concepted and and that's in
those games
and it kind of matches the the hurston
style like we took a lot of uh
the loreville cbd art style
um took a bit of inspiration from from
those concepts as well so
i thought that that kind of matched up
with his uh his work desk
he's uh he's a little bit lonely um
so you've got to have some some company
for your tea party
when you when you're uh taking a few too
many substances out in the desert
all right so yeah let's uh let's look
out here
just a reminder to folks who are
submitting questions in the chat uh
chris is a lighting artist
if your question is about process in how
to light a scene
those are the types of questions that
are appropriate for chris if your
question is gameplay related
or even graphics related or engine
related stuff
which we've talked about to some extent
uh those aren't questions that are
appropriate for
for chris that's my jam yeah so
see a lot of really good and really
interesting questions unfortunately
chris is not the person
uh for those in case you're wondering
why are they answering asking my
question
i'd love to answer it if i knew the
answer
remember this is an art process stream
so if your question is about
the process of lighting or a space
that's appropriate
if it's can we shoot out lights or stuff
like that or gameplay related stuff
is not the stream for that unfortunately
wrong chris
one day maybe one day i'll know enough
about everything
that i can just do every question that
you've got
uh so what i'm gonna do now is just for
the the sake of lighting this guy
i'm gonna set up a camera that i can use
here
um and the main reason for that is just
that i want to
i want to get some nice depth of field
and separation on the background here so
i'm going to knock that down crank up
the focus distance a bit
see if i can find where that focal plane
is
about right uh we're missing some
background there so
[Music]
a couple million kilometers of rendering
distance
and i'm just gonna try and angle this
guy a little bit here
so all right so actually it looks like
just these
these lights from the environment
already do a pretty decent job
um but i'm going to get rid of those
lights and kind of do something else
i think uh
that's on this layer
it looks like it's probably the probe
[Music]
a bit of uh some redness from something
uh as a follow-up to your uh 280
uh light source question do do vfx
and and other intermittent light sources
like that count against that number
uh they would so if if vfx um
was doing something i don't know like
for example like fireflies
and they were cut they had light sources
they were giving off
that would all count towards that that
limit
what i don't know though is if they were
i don't know if there's a difference
between like gpu particles if they were
casting lights versus
kind of the light entities that we place
if that kind of runs through a different
system or not
uh but i would guess that they all kind
of uh follow the same
uh the same budget sorry i just had to
delete a
inappropriate message in chat there
all right so right now i'm seeing like
the
my q map is picking up a lot of red and
that's uh from the the glow that's kind
of built into the um
the structure here so i'm actually just
gonna go in and
i'm just gonna kill the glow in the
material
uh just because i want a as clean a a
base as possible
to light this guy's head chat seems to
think this is a clem's
uh twin brother cletus
yeah exactly this is a desert climb
so i'm gonna grab this glow and i'm
gonna kill it there we go
and i'll rebake this guy
that's better so there's a little bit of
uh of light coming from these guys back
here but that'll be fine
i'm just gonna add to it i think all
right so
uh when it comes to character lighting
it's it's uh
i guess it's kind of similar to doing
environment lighting but um
obviously you've got a single thing to
focus on whereas in the environment
you've got
different camera angles um different
points of interest that kind of stuff
so for a character i'll start looking
for
a key light source and
again i don't have anything immediately
motivating in the scene i've got these
guys back here so i'll probably use that
as a motivated rim light and i'm just
going to do like a basic
um three point lighting setup which is
kind of the
the most common uh way to light
characters
or to light humans in general
finding a good kind of brightness value
for my
for my key light and turn it into a
projector
and shine it at him
and find where i want it to land
something like that turn on shadows of
course
get some nice uh nice self shadowing
i'll try and just move it around a
little bit and
see if i can find something kind of cool
um
so i made like for the for the real klim
you know we had some very dramatic
lights because that that kind of lent
itself to his his cd
environment um so i'll do something a
little bit similar
i mean his face just just begs for some
sinister looking lighting so
yeah it cannot be understated how
important lighting is
especially for character it's like when
you had it there and it was
completely blown out uh you know he just
thought yeah kind of weird
and off-putting but now he looks yeah
yeah you can you can light something
really bad really easily
let's find a nice kind of mid-point here
let's let's go with this
um and let's let's find a nice color
it's always interesting kind of picking
a color sometimes you got to be careful
because
the more saturated you get you can
really start making human skin
look really sick and uh and dead
um what's the
uh let's go with something like from
mandy that would be kind of cool we've
got a little bit of
frame rate slow down here is that is
that happening in the engine or is that
just uh
our video chat uh i think it might be
the video
my frame rate's looking pretty good at
the moment
[Music]
oh well we're working with what we got
all right and now i'm gonna add a light
kind of to
help help the rim light here so i mean
this is kind of exactly what you would
do
on a movie set as well you'd hide
something
up off screen if the lights themselves
aren't enough then you just kind of
add a little bit extra
and in this case i'm not going to use a
color i'm going to use an actual light
temperature because we can basically
pick uh with our lights if we want to
use like a gel which would just be any
kind of saturated rgb color
uh obviously you can find the right
colors in there but it's a bit more
difficult
or we also have like proper light
temperatures from like a
1000 to 15k
range but i'm gonna match these guys out
there they look like they're about
35k
all right so that's the rim light
portion we'll just keep it there for
time's sake and then just add a fill
and again like with those ratios it's so
easy to just completely
nuke it uh with the fill light being too
bright so let's
let's bring that guy down
[Music]
and maybe let's see maybe this is like a
slightly bluer
i always like playing with some really
extreme
lighting colors uh maybe
this is maybe this is like
from the uh from the sky actually so
let's
jump out instead of coming from the
bottom i'm going to bring this fill up
kind of bring it out from the side or
from the top
[Music]
yeah that's kind of cool
[Music]
there you go so we get some nice like
subsurface scattering in his ears from
the rim light
i'm not loving my my brake lights
uh key light here so let's let's try and
find something else
just go with something kind of sickly
warm
i mean and as as with kind of everything
in lighting is like you can
you're never really done you just kind
of stop at some point when it looks good
that's that is true of every
every art well discipline there is you
know
i don't remember who had the original
quote but art is never finished it's
only abandoned
yeah exactly so once the deadline hits
then then i'm done
but uh yeah you can you can tweak this
stuff forever
so now what i'm looking for is um if i
turn this off and just go back into my
camera
his eyes are looking very flat and dead
and that's just because the the
placement of my lights just means that
i'm not getting a specular highlight
catching in his eyes which is very
common
in the in cg or computer graphics
so i'm just going to add a specific
catch light
just to help that out a little bit um
because without it
eyes start to look really dead
i gotta i gotta find this the sweet spot
[Music]
it's starting to come in now
turn it way down
yeah there we go
[Music]
all right as we demonstrated before you
you're setting your lights down getting
the lights you want and then you'll find
fixtures to yeah exactly i mean
in this case like maybe i'm i'm doing
something for a cinematic
uh so like the the pipeline for or
workflow for lighting a cinematic is
very different from
what we would do in the pu so uh
what we what we try and do is is make
our characters look as good as possible
all the time
but you know the the difference between
a
a movie and a game like the primary
difference obviously
is that you can move around you can come
at a character from any angle and uh
therefore the artist doesn't really have
any true control over how the character
looks
um in a movie you know everything is set
up
very very specifically in every single
shot and lights don't
generally make sense like they're just
kind of placed in space around
reflected that kind of stuff um for
lighting
a game like if this was a game character
that we were doing
this uh this light rig probably wouldn't
work and i would have to kind of
unfortunately kill kill everything i've
just done
uh weep a little bit and then start
again
and uh in this case i would um
try and find a way to to motivate that
light
from the scene so i'd i'd pick a kind of
a direction
uh so maybe maybe he's got like some
lights hanging off of his um
off of his thing here and then i'll try
and see if i can make something like
that work
like this kind of gives him a little bit
of
a bit mysterious kind of don't want to
mess with him vibe
and then again luckily because it's a
sci-fi game we can kind of
we can justify having lights in places
where
most people wouldn't actually put lights
so if i put a light on the floor
um kind of like how i had in in the
original lighting setup
you can have something down here and now
now if this was like kind of game
lighting or like in game lighting it
would be a little bit closer to
something like this
and then we can kind of tweak things a
little bit more
um we just have a little bit less of
that that really fine control
like specifically with putting in a um
a an eye catch light like the specular
highlights on his eyes
that's a lot more hard a lot harder to
uh
to motivate in an actual level design
kind of sense of lighting
cool yeah that's uh that's kind of cool
there so
yep did that light go i had a light in
here
oh well it's lost to the ages
and i think finally we'll just
pull the sun up
and let cletus klim bask in the uh the
morning glow
of another day
yeah there we go very
cool thank you so much chris
yeah anytime taking us through a bit of
your process i mean obviously
you know every time we do one of these
shows whether it's lighting or
props or weapons or characters or
whatever uh
you can't fit the uh you can't fit the
entire process in the space of an hour
yeah i mean there's so much more that i
could do um
so many different angles that you can
approach this stuff from so
we do appreciate the the the scratching
the surface if you will
uh taking this um you can go ahead and
uh
stop the screen share uh that's it for
the show this week guys
uh as we are as we like to do here we
are going to throw the raid to a star
citizen streamer who is streaming right
now
uh my understanding is that it is hc
vertigo
uh who haven't seen in quite some time i
i i
i've i'm at hc vertigo a couple of times
um
there's a pretty good streamer i think
he's mining right now so
um when you if you want to join in the
raid you can hit the little button at
the top of the chat and you join the
raid
and uh when you get there uh everybody
scream
turn the lights on he'll have absolutely
no idea
uh what's going on uh for for star
citizen live
uh i'm jared uh that's chris join us
uh next week uh for a very special ship
showdown live uh it's gonna be different
uh until then we'll see you then uh take
care
uh be safe and uh
keep on trucking
i don't know see everybody
you
