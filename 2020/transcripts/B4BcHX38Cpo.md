the players and the people they get shot
by one of these things are gonna be
fried to words
unlimited power you feel like a god
firing the sniper rifle it's like you're
firing lightning down from the heavens
electron damage is a new energy damage
type that we've got going in game and
it's comprised of several different
other damage types really it's a little
bit of energy a little bit of distortion
and a little bit of a new damage type
that we have another called stun so the
damage types we've got in game at the
moment they're a little bit more
straightforward ISM we've got ballistic
and laser and it's kind of like it's
very straightforward what those things
do there's no like additional special
behaviors one of the big things about
electron is and there's multiple levels
we can kind of pull as designers it's
comprised of energy damage distortion
damage and something called stun damage
which you will have seen in the new
melee damaged systems so with the new
damage type we obviously needed new
weapons to go with that and after a
discussion with the writers we thought
lightning bolt company would be the best
fit that we kind of had on paper it was
only a couple of sentences but there's a
cooperation matrix that we looked
through and we saw that is like they
were called lightning bolt company and
it was like a PMC turned like military
weapons manufacturer are the sick of
everyone else's crap it was quite cool
too and I linked them in and get
something really in the cave the two
weapons that we wanted to work on were a
sniper rifle and a pistol because
they're like opposite ends of the
spectrum we get to test this new damage
type really thoroughly with them both
when it came time to start modeling the
actual weapons in game it starts off
with a website that has the development
of the weapon up to that point we're
given a concept piece as well as a
concept model it's been rendered in
keyShot which just adds some materials
to it though which is great for us to
work from and to be honest because it
allows us to already build upon the work
of somebody else's so you can get a
better product in the end of things and
then it's our job to kind of take that
to a functionable level a lot of the
time you have to make changes such as
are this grip is too far away this
doesn't quite work you have to kind of
reject the concepts
it's actually functional to sniper from
the pistol are both very different in
their usage so the sniper rifle is a
kind of extreme power end of the
spectrum it fires very slowly
despite the sniper rifle being quite a
high-tech weapon it does have a pull
action for reloading and that's so it
always feels much more powerful that way
because you can really see the
resistance of the character pulling it
back adding power to the shot when you
do fire it on top of it
Plus on top of that it also chains
electron damage between targets with the
damage some of the key elements of
lightning weapons are the moving parts
all those things that you don't really
see on other weapons really make this
one stand out so the sniper rifle has
the vents at the side that open up it
has all the pins that spin same as the
pistol but I think the pistol is more of
a shrunken down version of the sniper
rifle but it is weaker but what that
does mean is if you do shoot someone you
can shoot them quickly twice in
succession it makes it a lot more
exciting to use and wield just the
reload animation alone getting that to
work as well as a challenge but I think
it's really worth it for how you get to
like whip it out and you have to take
out it's a bit like a flare gun that
gives a lot of opportunities for VF at
the effects artists to play around as
well and see some of the effects there
once we had the concept put together
some effects just initially block out
how the gameplay loop would work so like
placeholder effects for each of the
vents the muzzle flare having it fire
yeah just just trying to work out
visually how the lining would arc around
the gun how it would affect the player
we knew for a fact that down the barrel
we want to get all the visual interest
in there and the mechanisms that we
wanted to play with we're all to do with
this charge system that you were having
to cycle out and discharge so we were
already talking to VFX in the concept
phase to make sure that we were giving
them kind of these items all over the
gun that you can see
you know me doing your shots doing your
reloads there's tons of interesting
things to see and look at so when the
weapon is fired it releases this
powerful arcing electrical discharge
that propagates down the end of the
barrel towards the target so for this
I'm using like beams blinds and the
trail limiters to make a sort of
lightning arcing effect really like
releasing from the actual muzzle flash
itself then when when it actually hits
the target it impacts which is just
generally GPU sparks some steam there's
an electrical crackle which is again
trails
that's mixture of textures and some
distortion once it's fired again another
target it creates this Chain Lightning
effect then if you get shot again it
causes an electron discharge which is
like a mini which does a little bit of
additional damage to you and anyone new
and then that can also someone else's
charge NIMH will cause a chain reaction
and cause them to pay you as well which
is a big big wave of release of like
plasma and distortion and some extra
crack the electric
these two weapons robbed the lethal
variety of electron and there are many
kind of aspects we can play with the the
multiple damage types in there that
we've got and then down the line we want
to do bouncing into weapons like Tasers
we've already been talking about so you
know completely non-lethal it'll just
knock someone out to be captured but
yeah these two a very highly lethal
primarily like they'll be doing energy
damage to people I really like these
weapons cuz all the teams that you get
on them they really bring it together
and it looks better every single time
somebody does that pass on things in
addition to our first electron damage
FPS weapons the upcoming alpha 3.10 also
aims to bring with it the first
iteration of our new player trading app
an attachment to MOBA glasses over the
next several patches aims to set a
foundation that will allow citizens
better control of their emerging
commercial destinies so a key feature in
any MMO is the ability for players to
trade goods and services with each other
and pay each other for those goods and
services you might want to be able to
say here have this item or hey I'll buy
that spaceship off of you for X amount
or even hey if you can bring me from
point A to point B I will pay you this
amount these are core things in any MMO
and they've been lacking in star citizen
for a while now and we're gonna finally
be able to put them in place with the
player trading app
up until now we've had the service
beacons which are a system that allows
players to say I need a service
performed and I'm willing to pay this
amount of money for it and anybody could
accept them it was more of a grand
Craigslist call kind of situation as
with many other features we're going to
be developing this over time and rolling
it out in stages for what we call the
tier 0 the first release that's going to
come out we're going to allow players to
gift each other currency in this case a
alpha UEC and merit this will be a
one-way send there will not be any kind
of handshake process and it will be
limited exclusively to currency the
reason we're starting with this and it
seems very simple really but this is the
first time that we're really in star
citizen having ownership of something
transfer from one player to another
player and so we need to start with
something very simple and very easy to
track currency is that thing that way we
can make sure that there aren't any
hitches and he exploits all those things
kind of iron out any of the flaws before
we roll into more complicated things the
way the players will be interacting with
this they'll bring up a mobile glass app
it'll be one of the first new mobile
glass apps that were going to be
implementing in a while and it's going
to use our new building blocks
technology which is pretty exciting and
it's going to allow you to essentially
select a player from any player whether
they're on your server on a different
server whether they're offline online
and via name search similar to how we do
friends list searching and you'll be
able to select them and then type in an
amount of merit or a UC that you want to
send them and hit send and there will be
a confirmation process of course and
then they will get a notification that
your gift has arrived you will get one
that they have received it and there we
go our recent work in three nine on the
unified friendslist has actually allowed
us to search very easily a massive
database of all players that are playing
the game and with this we are now able
to allow you to quickly find a person
that you just type in their name no
matter where they are and send them
currency
and this just wouldn't have been
possible for so it's a pretty nice leap
forward so as we move from tier 0 to
future tiers we're going to be
implementing a few additional features
the first thing is a two-way trade
rather than simply sending a gift when
we do that what we will allow is for
players actually open an active trade
interface in between players where they
can almost barter you can put up a few
items on one side of the screen and see
what the other person is putting up on
their side of the screen and you'll be
able to see and see and trade and and
basically debate what you want to send
them and that is to allow the other
player to essentially say no I don't
want this or yes I do want that or
please give me more of this the next
step with that of course since we're
still at currency at that stage is to
add items when we say items that could
be ships that could be commodities that
could be guns that could be all kinds of
things and that next step is of course a
pretty massive layer of complexity which
is why we've kind of strict it out of
the earlier bids and then finally and
this is a very important bit up until
now when we've been doing these trades
and sending ownership if it was currency
it didn't have a physical location and
up until this point if it was a
commodity or something physical it was
going to basically stay where it was we
in a later iteration will allow players
to place their goods in the cargo decks
that you may have been hearing about
elsewhere and when you place them in
these publicly accessible spaces and put
them up for tray and put them to trade
with other players that will allow them
to be then shipped to other places we
actually hope to integrate this very
thoroughly with the shipping gameplay
that is so core to star citizen what we
learn this week well we learned that
there's more to fighting FPS battles
than just bullets and lasers that while
lethal at the moment electron damage
sets the stage for the kind of
non-lethal enforcement some bounty
hunters look forward to in the future
that when all is said and done shooting
lightning is just cool and that the
player trading app will continue to
iterate adding additional features and
functionality patch after
we're inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you next week
you
