so what sucks about the current
implementation of Porsche carrots is
that it's as huge coverall solution the
environment team makes these beautiful
cities and then we just put this red
shader on it which kind of obscures
everything they're kind of just in the
way they're difficult for us to author
there's these complicated shapes to like
let you fly into where the landing zones
are because we can't cut holes in it and
so it's not so clear where the
boundaries are and then it just kind of
becomes this difficult mess where it's
hard to tell where you stand with the
restrict areas and they just they just
look like they just don't so why do we
need restrict areas in the first place
well we need it to fit into the lore I
mean like real cities and real airports
have these restricted area spaces around
them just to keep the place orderly and
keep it under control so it doesn't get
too busy so we want to recreate that and
we also want to preserve that player
experience of some more walking around
in the city like you don't want you
don't to be walking around going to
shops and having some other player
flying and crash into you so we can
protect from that there's also just the
practical reason that you know the
environment team have created this super
detailed city and they've done it to the
best of their ability but for various
reasons it's not as perfect everywhere
and so you can make sure that you're
seeing the city from the best light
possible that said in 3.10 we've been
making some changes to the system part
of that is introducing landing splines
which is a feature that we wanted for a
long time the cities that will benefit
from the landings plans are cities where
the spaceport is right inside the city
that's gonna be Louisville and area 18
will have this new feature and the idea
is that the area surrounding the
spaceport is covered in a restricted
area all of the time and so we don't
have these complicated and shipped area
meshes and then when you request landing
permission a and an augmented reality
path shows up in your HUD that guides
you into the spaceport and that will
create effectively a tunnel through the
restrict area
and letting you fly in and get to your
your landing spot and the benefits that
we get from that are quite numerous
because now we don't need these
complicated meshes to let you fly to the
space for it so we can have these large
simple meshes that don't have shader on
and then we'll provide you with
information through your HUD about your
stats relating to that airspace so for
example if you fly into the airspace
you'll get a notification saying you've
entered your Valero Space contact ATC to
land and likewise if you get too low we
can give you a message saying you know
below you is the restrict area
don't don't fly any lower and then as
you get closer to the spaceport it'll
say oh by the way you can't enter this
area there's a restrictor in front of
you and because these are really simple
shapes this holds up a lot better
because we don't need to give you this
information to navigate a very fancy
mesh it's just simple spheres and stuff
and so we hope that this will make the
experience feel a little bit more
natural and less artificial and make it
really feel like you're interacting with
that airspace so that's what we've
gotten 3.10 looking forward we're going
to be focusing on users of the
improvements so better communication
telling you where your your landing spot
is telling you where the spline is
things like that but we're pretty happy
with the progress we've made and so we'd
really like to hear any feedback you
have for the future this feature
when an app Spectre feature is too small
too large too early or too busy for an
individual segment we like to pull them
all together mix them up into a sort of
video game gumbo throw in a dash of
narration and a heaping pile of work in
progress for a thing that we like to
call the Sprint Report let's get to it
first up is a new generalized layout and
drag-and-drop system for building blocks
intended to be the basis for potential
improvements to the inventory management
system the idea here is that each area
can be marked as a drop target
synchronize with external storage space
in your backpack additional spaces on
the chest and/or legs and the like and
that when an item represented here in a
variety of box sizes and shapes is moved
from one area to the next
they are either displayed on the
character in the correct area or hidden
within the backpack if placed there but
don't get too caught up in the numbers
or items you see here as usual any
numbers you see here are placeholders
designed only to prove out a concept or
technology but it's an exciting next
step and the further iteration of
inventory management for players in the
persistent universe we've previously
highlighted work by the VFX team on
their efforts to create a new gold
standard for atmospheric reentry and
we've got another update for you
work continues using signed distance
fields to create effects that systemic
Lee use the speed angle and precise
shape of a ship to create an effect that
is both dynamic and just cool to see and
what this latest iteration the work
doesn't just benefit those of us who are
flying anymore as now re-entry effects
from other ships can be seen from as far
away as the surface of a planet or moon
making for an incredibly cool site up
above as you or anyone else is working
or exploring down below in other fire
related news the VFX team has also been
creating the testbed for a voxel based
fire system seen here in a very early
simple implementation design for
prototyping well this will be expanded
upon for actual implementation in the
future this already has some very useful
debug options designed specifically to
test propagation in this version the
smoke and fire spawn
separately within a voxel while each
voxel has its own emitters this isn't
precisely the way we intend any final
implementation to work but it's
functional enough for this initial
prototype which isn't actually designed
to demonstrate or test the quality of
fire but instead to determine how many
potential propagation of flame might
work and for those of you curious about
how fire might look or a move with the
gravity turned off so are we that's next
along with proper entity based fire
networking tests and improve propagation
all around propagating along two
environments first up we have these in
progress images of a factory line
Microtech corporation's premiere retail
store and while there are many other
locations throughout the galaxy the
flagship store will be found on their
own planet with an interior that is
sleek simple and intended to be hip and
designed eventually players will find
retail shopping opportunities for
consumer and micro tech products like
custom mobile glass a job board and
maybe even a service representative or
two with missions of their own to
fulfill we also have a look at the
inside of the current part white box
part rain box progress of the upcoming
cargo decks currently scheduled to come
online later this year as we mentioned
in last week's player trading app
segment future iterations will tie into
game play here where folks will be able
to leave things for consignment
providing a place for the storing and
transfer of goods for both players and
NPCs alike cargo decks are intended to
be placed among major trading routes or
Lagrange points as well as in
geostationary orbit above major landing
zones to perform their function as both
commercial harbours and warehouse for
all major trade goods in the universe
they're also expected to provide a range
of cargo and trade related missions as
well as those relating to trade security
so there's a little something for
everyone here
finally we've got this look at work on
the new ocean shader improvements you
may have seen on the star citizen public
roadmap because this has been working to
Cepeda by the team for some time the
changes have been made without requiring
the reauthorization I stay on Hurston
the ripples of the oceans actually
reacted dynamically with the wind
overhead becoming more turbulent or less
to pass to us with the wind sir
so what we learn this week well we
learned that while necessary to serve a
number of functions I think everybody is
happy to revisit restricted areas and
make them less obtrusive less ugly and
easier to work with than ever before
that inventory improvements are on the
way along with a fair amount of fire and
that new areas aren't just pretty to
look at some come with the promise of
new gameplay opportunities like factory
line and cargo decks I'm gonna ask
around about the ocean stuff for inside
star citizen I'm Jared Huckaby we'll see
you next week
