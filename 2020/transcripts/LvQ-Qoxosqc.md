what is lighting it's more than just
placing many lights around to brighten
up a scene we also want to make objects
and characters look good for example
this scene right here it's it's clearly
too dark the background is too dark you
can't see me very well so for an
interview situation this won't do so how
would I fix this first of all turn on
this light this adds a little bit of
warmth a little bit of character on me
specifically the background still too
dark but we can take care of that later
I think the next step is I would add
some filled lights so now I'm a little
bit better lit I've got this is mag
light here I could probably turn that on
you know this is it's too much light now
for me it's it's blowing out things and
now for the background I think I think
we can harness the power of natural
lighting for this one and there we go
that's much better
so lighting pretty cool the role of
lighting artistically is to create a
very interesting atmosphere that the
player maybe hasn't seen before
and makes them excited to explore this
specific space and the other primary
focus is to assist the player in being
able to navigate a certain space so
that's calling out certain places that
the player can go or points of interest
that the player can interact with so one
of the biggest problems we have lighting
in this game specifically is that the
the planets are rotating around their
axis which means that we have a fully
dynamic time of day and all of our
locations can be placed in any kind of
orientation or location on any planet
which means that we have no control over
where the Sun is what the path and the
travel path of the Sun is and we have to
work around where the Sun is and make it
look as good as possible at all times of
day as much as
again so in the past two concessions
that we've had to make for our
environment lighting is that for the
ambient lighting specifically we've had
to pre-bake our environment probes which
are basically entities that take a
sampling of the ambient lighting around
it and then reproject that lighting into
the environment because these are static
we've had to choose what time of day we
want to make them out which could be
daytime nighttime or dusk anywhere in
between
but they stayed static the whole time of
day cycle the other concession that
we've had to make is that the lights are
always on 24 hours a day which means
that even if the Sun is higher noon then
street lights are still on supporting
lights are still on this has impacts on
the performance obviously and doesn't
look so good it makes it environments
feel quite static but that said the
lighting team has been working on two
big improvements to our attack which
helped us tackle these issues so the
first new feature that we worked on was
what we call runtime probes this
basically is a an extra flag for the
environment probe entity that you can
enable and this tells the entity to
periodically update itself and and
recapture the ambient lighting based on
several things primarily the the
movement of the Sun so every few degrees
that the Sun moves in the sky the probe
will try and recapture that ambient
lighting and reprojected into the
environment the benefit for the players
in this case is that you can sit in an
environment and watch the the time of
day pass and the ambient lighting should
update accordingly which will help these
environments feel a lot more dynamic and
a lot more immersive so the second major
feature that we've been working on is
what I called a nightlight groups this
basically takes the existing light
groups feature that we've had running
previously in ships for things like
damaged states and emergency states this
allows us to use those same controls but
on a time of day basis so we can choose
a specific state for the light group to
use during the day and for the night
time
what this means for the lighting team is
that we can add a whole new layer of
complexity to environments such as
turning on overall city lights when it
becomes nighttime and turning them off
during the day which saves performance
because you can't see them anyway it
allows us to turn on and off street
lights based on the time of day which
feels very realistic and it allows us to
in the case of new beverage we can
create a an entirely new mood and
atmosphere in a specific location when
it's night time compared to when it's
daytime
the ambient lighting also changes over
the course of the day thanks to the the
runtime probes so personally I'm really
excited about these features because
they allow me to to really create
variety within a single environment so
we have the same geometry but we can
make it feel like very different
locations very simply and also
dynamically so as for when these
features will be rolled out we're
looking to in the next patch and beyond
convert our existing legacy landing
zones like Laurel and airy 18 and other
planetary locations to use runtime
probes and day-night like groups we're
also looking to expand this into other
planetary locations like our surface
outposts and underground facilities and
other locations and you can actually
already see these features live now in
patch 3.9 in new Babich which was our
first kind of testbed for this if you go
to Wally's bar you'll notice that
there's a very distinct nighttime mood
compared to the daytime so yeah we're
we're really excited about these
features and what they will bring to
star citizen we hope that you guys enjoy
it as much as the lighting team has
enjoyed breathing new life into legacy
locations
new locations as well from lighting the
universe to filling it with characters
locations and spacecraft here's this
prim report starting things off with
characters we've got a quick look at
additional concepts for yoga outfits for
the NP seeds of new Babbage where
personal health and well-being is an
important aspect in maintaining the
optimum productivity for any valued
employee and at Microtech every employee
is valued take that workers of
Louisville also a new Babbage's work on
a mission giver named Eddie Parr now
Eddie's the bartender at Wally's and
since there's a slew of entertainment
coming in and out of Microtech it's
believed he's been running a side racket
with his old friend Michael shot a
smuggle we'll call it contraband in for
the locals hey people got to cut loose
and yoga ain't for everyone but before
we see Eddie Parr in yoga outfits the
environment art team is putting the
finishing touches on their hi-tech
hangar set that will eventually populate
the spaceport at new Babbage like the
hangars already in place in Lord Ville
an area 18 these will come in a variety
of shapes and sizes to accommodate most
ships in the persisting universe just it
just wait for the doors to be completely
open before you try to pass through
don't don't be like disco the cargo
module interiors we first saw concepts
for two weeks ago have moved into white
box phase as they look to expand the
gameplay opportunities for cargo haulers
everywhere with new contracts new
opportunities and eventually tie-in
functionality with the upcoming player
trading app which when used together
will facilitate the transfer of
commodities and such between players in
tech updates on Friday viewers of star
citizen live got an in-depth look at the
gas tech being developed from both star
citizen and squadron 42 and what we
showed on Friday's show could be done in
about an hour but what you're seeing
here are tests that are much farther
along the idea here is to explore where
we can add texture to the space escapes
of the persistent universe with this
test specifically for those wayward
space stations found between the planets
of the Stan
system now this is look dev in its
purest form as artists explore what's
possible as opposed to building
something specifically that you'll find
around one station or another
now once the capabilities have been
identified in the process is developed
and streamlined this work will form the
basis for her gases found throughout the
persistent universe including in
asteroid fields around space stations
near jump points and beyond
finally from outer space down to the
surface of our planets and moons as the
planet tech team continues to enhance
and build upon planet tech before
sometimes it's required to go back and
update older content to match the still
advancing state of our tech in the case
of these new height maps which we
touched on a little last quarter the
main objective here is to make better
use of the available texture resolution
for every piece of elevation and climate
data in both the persistent universe and
squadron 42 the benefits of which will
be better object distribution nicer
ground material breakup natural color
transitions more accurate for additions
reeds and more another benefit of this
enhanced detail pass is that our artists
can now work with data that is much more
accurate which will in turn be more
predictable and ultimately makes for a
much easier and more efficient time
painting the planets which will just
speed up the overall process even more
than it already has so what we learn
about this week well we learned that it
can often be the little things like turn
the lights off when the Sun comes up or
enabling ambient light to fill a room as
we'd expect that can lead to the greater
sense of immersion that there's even
more coming a new Babbage and all 43.1
and beyond the gas clouds can add a bit
of texturing to make space scaping more
interesting and that even with planet x
v4 as good as it already is there could
still be ways to make the process faster
and look better than ever before for
inside star status and i'm jared huckaby
we'll see you next week
