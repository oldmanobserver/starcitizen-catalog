hey everybody welcome to another edition
of calling all Deb's our Q&A series
where we take cushions from you the star
citizen community and pose them directly
to our developers usually over
videoconferencing I'm Jared Huckaby
let's get right to it all right so this
question I think is perfect for Ally
Brown or director of graphics
engineering we're gonna see what he has
to say Ali how you doing man I'm good
thanks thank you for taking the call
from home we are of course in a
work-from-home era here with all the
world stuff going on so we're gonna
we're gonna jump right into it I got a
question here from a star citizen we've
been getting this a lot just gonna jump
right into it it says how's work on the
gen 12 Vulcan conversion going what can
you tell us so folks you start
explaining what it is before we saying
where it is at the moment very tough so
so yeah we've mentioned two things there
there's the gen 12 when do or generation
12 when were and then there is the fact
that it's gonna primarily use the Vulcan
API so the gen 12 is just a name we came
up with for our renderer which is going
to utilizing multiple CPU cores more
than the previous vendor which mainly
only runs on two CPU cores these days we
tend to have eight or 16 cores or more
so there's a lot of focus on pleat
computations so that at one time it's
much faster so that's type of the gems
well and under the hood it's going to
use the Vulcan graphics API in fact
initially it's going to use DirectX 11
which is the current engine uses and
Vulcan and then once we've got the
Vulcan support to be better though the
DirectX 11 support or drop DirectX 11
and we fully over to Vulcan Vulcan is a
more modern API it's much lighter weight
much faster as much closer a thinner
layer of abstraction over what the GPU
actually does so that gives us a lot of
performance boost but it takes a lot
more time to program for so it's a lot
more
initial investment but then we get big
performance wins once we get over the
initial hurdle
okay and where we are so it's
complicated the answer so we have a lot
of multiple mini teams we've set up in
the graphics and engine program at
departments and they're tackling type of
six separate areas so each of those six
and where we're up to so there is type
of the the highest level one is the the
pipeline render pipeline we call init
which is type of the way we structure a
frame that we might first we render some
shadows and then we some renter
detective work and then we'll get on to
a depth pass a color pass then we'll do
the UI and such but I'd type of pipeline
it's type of the frame of the glues all
together but it is starting soon but we
haven't actually needed to do that bit
first so that's the first but that's not
what you would imagine we'd start there
but actually it's the opposite we've
started when this is the new reality so
at the other end of the system we have
the the Vulcan device this is the lowest
level part of it which is where we
actually issue commands to the GPU using
the Vulkan API so that's such the first
thing which died on at the very lowest
level the most difficult part oh my god
a couple of guys just working on that
one section alone and then another
studio we've got some people looking at
the type of the DirectX 11 equivalent so
type of what we're going to use in the
meantime while we get this lender up and
running and because we already have
DirectX 11 support that's pretty much
done there's not a lot to do there
there's not a lot of concerns so that
section is okay and then we have like
above them both we have this common
layer so there is differences between
DirectX and vulcan and by having this
type of common layer above we can type
of abstract that and hide that
difference of a higher level rendering
code doesn't need to worry about whether
it's direct X or Vulcan and again that
part of it is pretty much done and
that's not a particularly complicated
bit but then the wheelwork it comes down
to two remaining topics so we have the
post effects and we have the type of
what we call in the scene submission the
scene when doing so the post effect
our bloom our lighting you know all
these type of things like the general
effects you know and some of the facts
of people hate you know motion blur and
for my separation as well but you know
the ones that people don't hate so much
as well and then we have the land that's
a big chunk of work and we have two guys
just working on that they're getting
quite far though quite far food that I
couldn't give a percentage but they've
made very good progress and they've
started with the hardest ones
intentionally so that we proved the
system and then there's that there's
gonna be a bit of grunt work to get
through the more trivial ones afterwards
and then the final big topic is the
scene submission which is getting
basically the geometry into the game
into the regulars so like you know our
shadows and our color pass and just type
of getting all of this geometry very
quickly and efficiently into the
renderer and that's probably one of the
larger sections and that's only that's
just about started so the moment we've
got good progress on the Vulcan device
the DirectX 11 device the common layer
that binds them together and we've made
good pose and the post effects and then
that the main large areas that are still
tougher to be started or to make
sniffing progress is the scene
submission and the the overall render
pipeline it glues all together so yeah
it's hard to give it like a to give this
if this is the time where we it's like
from beginning to end but we're here
it's not me but I don't know it's hard
to give a these are each these six
things are extremely big and complicated
in themselves we have lots of designs
there's endless discussions on each of
these topics
so even when programming hasn't started
we can be many weeks into work before we
even got to that stage so yeah there's
progressing well though and there's a
lot of resources dedicated this
internally well you could save some time
if you just skip the chromatic
aberration public it wouldn't be a lot
of time
I won't even get into that argument okay
and what are the before I let you go
what are the you touched on the benefits
earlier but but just in a short looking
for the sound but I guess in summary
what's the benefit of this work why are
we doing this work two reasons the first
reason is performance we get the ability
to spread I use a more efficient API
they can spread work over all of your
CPU cores which rules all in a much much
faster rendering process on the CPU side
and much lower latency as well latency
is quite important a lot of people these
days and the second side is because more
modern API it opens a door to many new
features that we didn't previously have
access to which are things like ray
tracing VRS and async compute and
there's a lot of things we couldn't do
locked to the previous API ID so
performance then features afterwards so
it seems like a big part in letting star
citizen realize its full potential
we don't really have a choice this has
to happen this is the next logical step
we can't really achieve the performance
or the visuals we want without taking a
step first want to put a date on it No
thank you it's our biggest focus this
year there's nothing else that we are
putting anywhere as much resource in for
the graphics team for the graphs to go
yeah jitter just a graphics an engine
team yeah fair enough all right Ali
thank you I think that was great
I think we covered what it is how it
works and why we're doing it and
couldn't ask for anything more so thank
you so much I'll let you go
thanks a lot I take it alright so for
our next question we were going to
senior system designer Geoffrey coffin
for a question about the idris Jeffery
how you doing man
I'm alright I'm alright it's a different
working from home but I'm progressing
that's our that's our reality for the
moment thank you for taking the call
we're gonna jump right into this we have
a question about the Idris now players
know that the Idris is being introduced
into the persistent universe with the
upcoming Arlington bounty series but
that's an NPC controlled address this
question is about the player facing
address you give us a status update on
where the Idris is in regards to being
available for players in the brazils
universe yeah sure so the x-ray of the
address is mostly there which is why
we're gonna be putting on to be using
its all the damages so a lot of damages
set up for it the exterior networks all
their thrusters etc which is why that
can happen but for the interior it's
still fairly working progress because
squadron 42
it's very working progress they're still
we need like anybody works to go in any
changes to the peak up or anything needs
to be updated within the address the
interior is still very much in flux and
in addition to all that as well it's a
big multi cruise ship so as these as
these features get implemented we need
to obviously refine what's present
inside the ship so currently as it
stands really the ship interior isn't in
the stage where we can give it to the
public and probably won't be for a while
you make you mean you made a comment
there about the multi crew and we're
gonna talk to Dave Coulson here in a
little bit about multi crew gameplay it
can't be understated how important that
is to something like the interest
because the interest is is because
there's a capital ship yeah you mean is
one person meant to just fly this thing
around like a fighter is one person can
technically fly around like a fighter
but you you will be getting barely any
other ships functionality out of it I
mean your pilot will be able to you know
fly the ship but you're supposed to have
a navigator who will be navigating where
you're going to go to and helping you
avoid or go to hotspots you'll have
people Manning the air traffic control
seats who if you want to have any ships
take off and fly away or even new ones
flying in you'll need to have you know
someone to manage all about the pilot
can't do all of this on their own you
know weapon sees to handle
the railgun at the front even a captain
who if someone's being belligerent in
the crew might be able to turn around
and like demote someone on the fly and
say no you can't do that anymore so
there's a lot of this functionality that
is going to be going into the ship it
should be going into the ship but it's
just not there yet we don't have it
ready like so essentially what you would
have if you release the interest right
now is a giant fighter and just no I
don't think most people would appreciate
that it's very nerve talk to me a little
bit about the work for the Arlington
Bennie mission before we let you go now
it is coming the the exterior control
the NPC control the exterior is coming
to the - there are n thin bounty series
in half of three point nine how do you
balance something like this it was
really tricky so initially before
obviously like the mission took too much
shape one of the first things that came
my ways was to actually try to balance
the address around fighting different
amounts of ships so I'd start spawning
like hammer head after hammer head after
hammer head just having like tons of
hammer hits fighting the ship and then I
try out maybe throwing in some Italia
toes with their torpedoes one of the
first things we quickly discovered was
with the way the ship's currently set up
there they've got like a small health
pool on multiple parts of the ship and
as you take damage it'll spread up the
ship and eventually go to the core
location then kill the ship what
happened with one size 9 torpedo is the
Splash Damage within so many locations
one would just kill the interest
straightaway so we immediately like
right we need to give this thing a
bigger centralized health pool and then
kind of have have the other areas have
slightly less just to kind of balance it
out so it was a lot of iteration just on
the health of the ship alone let alone
tweaking the the shield generators
because this things are capital size
your generators like the 890 has which
make it huge and very difficult to
damage in the first place so there was a
lot of juice or base iteration just
making this thing resilient enough to
actually require a bunch of people to
kill but not be completely unkillable in
the first place and I imagine one of the
benefits of it going into the precision
universes that we're going to be able to
to witness thousands and thousands of
players you know fighting this thing and
taking this on and
and getting that data back that will
help additional balance see in the
future absolutely like these capital
ships they're kind of untested waters as
far as obviously net game play games you
had fighters out in there in the
university years we know very like very
well how they work but for these much
larger ships which you're not supposed
to be able to take that with an
individual fighter so having you know in
a radius just ramming to the interesting
killer would be a problem
so having taking out the players who are
a fairly creative bunch there's probably
going to be a lot of interesting ways to
kill the interest that I'll get
discovered and we can start trying to
you know work around whatever gets
discovered out there is going to be
interesting certainly you're looking
forward to seeing in action it's like
every ship I work on you know you get
that sense of pride for what you really
wanted to do well even like I worked on
the Argo Emperor and that's just yes I
think you won about but I still I'm
still really proud of it and this ship
is it's huge I've been working on this
one for years so I'm really looking
forward to it actually getting to go out
there and even if the players can't fly
it they can at least blow it up we'll
see alright man I'll let you go thank
you so much for taking the time to
answer our questions today man alright
so last but certainly not least this
question is a biggie and I think we're
gonna go to Dave Coulson gameplay
programmer from the vehicle feature team
Dave how you doing man pretty good
thanks I called you Dave I know you
don't appreciate that I'm sorry David
that's right we're gonna jump right into
this this question from the starsin
tobacker voted up is deeper multi crew
gameplay planned
yeah absolutely deeper multi-crew
gameplay has been planned for I have
since the beginning right some interest
has been kind of picking up on it
recently we've had some discussions with
CR and to kind of refine how we're gonna
go about things
we've been looking into you know
building this permission system for
ships where the captain can assign item
control to specific people in the ship
so he can you know give the engineer the
role to control the power plan and the
coolers and a weapons officer in the
related control weapons that sort of
thing right and the hope is that over
time as we add more and more depth of
service systems gameplay inside the
ships that combined with the permission
system will be conducive to more and
more deep multi to gameplay because
right now I think all of the ship
control pretty much gets funneled to the
pilot and that's kind of the issue that
we want to solve in the near term and
then we'll continue adding depth to add
to make the multi crew experience more
interesting as we keep going right so
where does that start does that start
with the development of the individual
game features like like the evolution of
power systems the evolution of
components and subcomponents and stuff
like break the process out for for us
how this comes to life it starts with
game systems I imagine yeah it starts
with game systems it's it's one of those
things that like we don't want to have
this like very artificial feeling oh
this is what you do if you're this role
and you know if you're a weapons officer
this is your screen and it's designed
for economics we want it to feel a
little bit more natural where players
can come up with these roles themselves
but what we need to do is we need to
consider how the gameplay systems in the
ship interact with each other and more
importantly how players interact with
them so that when they get combined
together the natural result will be you
know roles like you see in like you know
a stereotypical multi-crew spaceship and
so that's pretty much what we're doing
like reviewing a lot of a lot of ship
systems and trying to see what we can do
to increase the depth and make it
interesting for players to engage with
those systems and then obviously you
know longer term is adding more features
to ships and I think that's probably
enough discussion for another calling
event are we talking like like mini
games or QuickTime events how does this
manifest to the to the play like let's
just say something like an engineer for
an example if I'm playing an engineer am
I gonna be sitting here going you're
playing Simon Says do me and then the
thing is magically fixed we don't want
we don't want mini games we don't want
QuickTime events as I said it's it needs
to feel natural it needs to feel like
this is the obvious thing for that
player to do so take engineer for
example the way an engineer might go
about things is if we increase the sort
of interaction inside ships which you
have you know maybe we have like
life-support inside the ship is failing
and you're you've run out of oxygen or
something like that the engineer might
have to walk over to a panel that has an
oxygen bottle have to open the panel go
inside get this oxygen what lab do some
actions to repair it I'm not exactly
sure how they'll work we haven't haven't
flesh that out quite yet and then
they'll go back and put that back in and
make sure it's working and so that's the
kind of thing where it's it's not it's
not minigames for a role its actions
that that interact with the ship systems
as the players yes physicalized some of
them are physicalized right learned
about one is obviously physicalized but
like for example you know scanning for
stuff is probably not physicalized it's
gonna be something where you're at a
scanning station with like a you know a
globe that shows you nearby context on
the radar and you know that sort of
thing it'll it'll depend a little bit on
what the feature is as to how it'll
manifest in the ship but obviously we
want some kind of a writing so and it's
not silly capabilities of that ship
because not every ship has yes yeah
obviously yeah yeah so like for example
a ship that has a med bed might have
more sort of gameplay for a medical
officer whereas ships that don't that
won't be applicable but yeah absolutely
yeah I you said you just you recently
just had a meeting with with CR that
this is a topic of conversation that's
current right now did you come out of
that with any particular roles by the
way that we're looking at that we're
considering yeah
so captain obviously is the the biggest
most interesting one the captain first
and foremost has this ability to assign
permissions to players but the captain
also we view as kind of like you know
being a captain is kind of like playing
a real-time strategy game where you you
say you will be able to see what's going
on in the nearby like battlefields say
if you're in a bow to the globe and then
the captain is like you know pointing
things out and giving orders to various
people on the ship and you know trying
to direct how things are progressing
while you're playing the game and that's
kind of Celeste the captain that's the
first role or how we kind of see what
their their actions are and pilot
obviously is pretty much already defined
engineer is a big one
this is going to be you know when we get
to increasing the depth of the power
systems inside large ships the engineer
will be you know naturally suited to
that kind of role there's also like
security officers which they can control
door access and that sort of thing
I played generally yeah I've not played
gyre but I'm one of those before you
know as old people will know what I'm
talking about you didn't know yeah so
those I think those are probably like
core pillars right so you got like
engineer captain pilot and then probably
like tactical officer or I don't know
what you would call the person who's
looking after scouting and radar is that
tactical officer or science officer if
you're not yes it's not a battle for
instance
yeah I think those are the main roles
and then I think there might be specific
roles for certain ships depending on
their feature set and players could also
just define their own roles if they want
it's not up to us if they want to give
players that or give a certain player a
specific set of items to control you can
make up that role however they want I
think I think that's that that's a big
part of this I don't want to bury the
lead there it's less about I think it's
less about us designating the types of
roles that players will be able to
assume on a ship and more about
providing people the tools and the
systemic ability to create their own
rules absolutely I think that's a much
more interesting gameplay prospect and
it's definitely what Chris is always
wanted for a multi-crew and this is this
is why interest and this is like picking
up for us at the moment because we want
to help the players define these roles a
little bit better and give those roles
something to do but I think that will
result in the most interesting and
varied multi-crew experience rather than
having these like originally defined
calls so so it sounds like before I let
you go just to make sure I kind of
understand
not necessarily a timeline but but but a
flow here it's developing the individual
ship systems like like power like
scanning like you know making scanning
more robust making power management more
robust making components and component
systems damages step more robust
developing those individual systems and
then it's finding a way to assign
permissions to manage those systems and
and study but yeah and then from there
players will have the tools necessary to
to create their own rules on ships yeah
absolutely
I think the order when things to come is
not exactly known like we it may be that
the ability to assign permissions is
something that we end up doing sooner
rather than later just because of how my
core that is to you know that experience
because right now as I said
just assigning all the permissions to a
specific player ruins a lot of this
right so yeah and then obviously
increasing the depth of the features is
going to be an ongoing process cool man
I think that's it I think that's a
productive we haven't we haven't been
able to update on this topic for a while
so I appreciate it especially since you
just had the meeting with CR recently
about it so yeah I'll let you go man all
right so your thank you we'll see you
again all right well that wraps up this
episode of calling all Deb's
I want to thank Allie Brown Jeffrey
Kaufman and Dave Coulson for taking time
out of their schedule to answer our
questions for us this episode remember
that you can submit your questions for
consideration up on spectrum which is
the communication platform available on
Roberts space industries calm and you
can vote to see which questions you want
to see address most for calling out debs
i'm jared huckaby we'll see you next
time
you
