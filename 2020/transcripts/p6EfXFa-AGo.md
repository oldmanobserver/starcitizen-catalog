so imagine if you will
i'm coming into new babbage spaceport uh
i've checked my hunger meter i'm a bit
low i know i need to go and get
something to eat
so i head down to the fruit market and i
buy a piece of apple with the
streamlined new interface we got
and it comes up into my inspect post
it's all looking great
and just as it does i notice all around
me players are appearing with an apple
in their hand
that's good that's the money shot well
done
we have a wonderful qa team all over the
world but there are some
issues that we can detect faster at
scale with a lot of players playing the
game
and that's where the issue council comes
in the issue council
is a tool on spectrum where players can
report
new bugs they can contribute to existing
bugs and
they can priority vote bugs they feel
are most egregious
we use that contribution system if it
gets to a certain level
to pull those bugs into our system to
pull our those bugs into our own jira
and we use the priority voting to figure
out which ones are the worst
i think the issue issue console is one
of the really big benefits we have
with a live product now also the fact
that they can provide
repro steps how did they get there what
did they do sometimes
you do something unexpected and that's
what creating the bug and it's hard for
us to reproduce without knowing
that's what you did we determine an
issue is valid by the number of
contributions it has once it hits a
certain threshold
in the case of the live issue council
that's 10 contributions
then we it gets confirmed and we realize
it's a valid issue
so when i first saw this particular bug
players were reporting that food was
randomly appearing in their hands which
is obviously a little bit strange
i went to the game and checked it out
and sure enough you could be riding the
train you could be flying your ship
whatever and just hamburger would just
appear in your hand
um i thought it was convenient i kind of
wished it
happened in real life obviously really
really funny bug
you know for me it's kind of almost
almost a feature at the time obviously
didn't realize that it was taking
money money out of your account you were
paying for that freebie food
it wasn't that much freebie anymore
discussed it quite a lot with keon we
kind of went through
the code kind of a bit backwards to to
see
where exactly is this extra piece of
food appearing from
um and then over time we kind of
traced it back to this purchase logic
that was
executing on all the machines and
send it over to spencer and his team
the bug made its way down to me because
i was responsible for implementing this
new feature
of picking up food when you buy it from
the store and so this is not just that
we're spawning fruit in your hand and
charging a uec
but you could see ridiculous scenarios
where you'd reach off to grab this item
and slide across the universe to get it
because
the way the carriable system works
trying to get that in your hands
so initially my thought was okay this
bug might have to do with how the item
is getting picked up and how we network
that
because uh i use the functionality we
already have called
post spawn action on our carriable items
so when you have that set the instant
this item is spawned it says oh
somebody's trying to carry me i need to
be picked up let me request that
i thought there was something wrong with
the networking there and this was a
total dead end
and was not at all what the problem was
so later down the road
i was investigating our new quick buy
feature which is
you'll see in shops instead of just
saying like oh buy or
try on there's also now a quick buy
option that you can get
and what that does is it circumvents the
need to like oh buy open moby glass uh
do i want to buy this buy okay
buy all right we got it as with a lot of
things adding a new feature
suddenly breaks things because this was
totally the problem
and the reason is because we circumvent
that mobi glass step
when you interact with something in the
game it's all server authoritative
and so like oh if i'm going to try to
pick up this item right now and i reach
and grab it
the server knows that you did that it
tells everybody else that you did that
and so here's where the problem is
normally when you interact with a shop
item and you say okay
there's the thing i'm going to interact
with that i'm going to open my mobi
glass so i have a chance to buy it
opening the moby glass is something that
only happens on your client
right so when everybody else gets told
about this interaction they say hey
spencer just opened up his moby glass
but like it's not your movie glass so
don't worry about opening it you know
um there's nothing there's not a real
moby glass there for me
on your computer but when we circumvent
the movieglass and say hey this person
tried to buy this thing essentially
everybody would get this interaction
call back
and just say i want to buy this item
everybody else doesn't have that step of
oh i don't have a mobile glass for that
character
it went right to the buy just spend
their own real money because somebody
else tried to make a purchase
so in the end the fix was actually
pretty straightforward and pretty easy
to implement it was only a few lines of
code really
but as with a lot of bugs in our game
the the hardest part is tracking down
why the issue is happening in the first
place going down several dead ends and
saying
okay this is really where the issue is
let's just put a couple lines of code in
let's prevent this scenario from
happening and now we're good
and it's really great that for issues
like this we have the issue council
to bring up like hey this this bug is
happening when we have a lot of players
and they're in the same location and
stuff
uh things that are harder for me as a
single developer to try to reproduce on
my own machine
and that you know it's easy to go
unnoticed with just one person it's
super important and it's a really great
thing and it it's
one of the things about this project
that adds to the whole um
life cycle you know that it's all live
it's all there you're always playing
almost what we're doing um as we're
doing it
so it's a direct connection between us
and
the players way back when
games like wing commander pioneered the
use of in-situation coms calls
where npcs would call into a screen in
the player's cockpit and provide
exposition
or react to current happenings in game
play for the upcoming squadron 42
this feature is being brought into the
21st century by the comms call strike
team
who are working to develop a systemic
solution that can stand up to scrutiny
from all angles
while providing experience that is both
diegetic within the game universe
and relatable to players who today have
video calls as a regular part
of their daily lives so comms calls
are a communication system from ship to
ship
and with squadron 42 involving the
player taking the role as a pilot
it's their primary use of communication
nice
brilliant brilliant
what we're currently doing with squadron
42 is you can even see
the person who's communicating to you
you know they're right there next to you
and then you can even fly over to them
and see them
animating and talking to you so we have
four types of cons calls we have cockpit
we have terminals we have mobi glass and
we even have fps weapons
we are currently shifting our focus to
the cockpit controls towards gold
standard gold standard is a term used
in the industry for when a feature team
or any cam development team
focuses on one aspect or one feature of
development and we
take full focus all the way to the end
delivery of it this
includes making sure that helmets for
pilots are lit
in the correct way to deliver a good
performance on the face we have cameras
set up
per ship so maybe some manufacturers
will have a different camera set up to
others
we also look at the
skeleton and animation of the pilot
themselves
making sure that each character brings
their own personality even to their
flight pose as well as their
deliberately of their lines
the imc is going to kill you and all
your mug friends
due to the current state of the pu the
coms calls are pre-recorded and
delivered based on context
ultimately it will be working the same
situ as squadron 42
where all dialogue lines we played in
real time
as it adds that next level of immersion
for instance
maybe your wingman is coming you that
needs to get these pirates off his back
and he's getting shot at left right and
center by their energy weapons and
they're dynamically listening to the
cockpit
last thing you want to see is all these
blasterfire on the cockpit
and then just have a pre-recorded
animation of an unlit cockpit can really
break the immersion
so the team is really coming together to
bring a terrific cockpit experience for
the player of squadron 42.
we have over 100 characters with
hundreds of dialogue
that's delivered all through different
ships different circumstances and should
be an experience to remember
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that even the most seemingly
innocuous bugs can have a potentially
devastating effect on the in-game
wallets of players everywhere
that with tools like the issue council
players can take an active role in the
development of star citizen
and that successful immersion for a
storytelling experience like squadron 42
can often come down to the little things
like
simply knowing the responses of our
opponents are accurately reflected in
the
mayhem around them for inside star
