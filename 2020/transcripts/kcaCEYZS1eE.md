hi everybody welcome to another edition
of star citizen live gamedev painting
planets I'm your host Jared Huckaby and
joining us on the show this week is
senior environment artist from our
Frankfort studio mr. Patrick Gladys
Patrick how you doing all good man
thanks for having you dude we we have a
we noticed during our auditors we've got
this little ASMR thing going you know
she would just do this entire show in
here somewhere if people if our
communities into listening me that's me
doing a saying that we'll save that for
when Paul Jones and and Luke Presley do
a show together so um so if you if
you've never seen Star citizen live
before it's our Friday broadcast we we
have a couple different formats
sometimes we do a big round table QA
sometimes we do a game dev which is
where we take and we take a period of
time to sit with an artist or a designer
or whomever and see a little bit of
their craft a little bit of process that
goes into their work on a daily basis
and that's what we're doing here today
so Patrick without further ado we're
just gonna jump right into this you take
the wheel
I'm gonna jump in the passenger seat and
play with the radio what are we doing
today what we will do today is take a
look at a couple planets check V for
features we have talked about them in
the past already also on this show when
Michelle and Sebastian were on last time
or some sums like a while back right but
this time we're focusing more on the
actual tools and the hands-on approach
actually showing off what it is what is
it like using the tools
how fast are they how flexible can we
change our content and make new planets
if we like - sure well why don't you
share your screen we'll get going
alright cool screen one get rid of you
Jarrett all right cool
all right so um what we have here is
basically damar but for all the people
who know what they may looks like this
is not really like the damar they wanted
that people can play and go to right now
since I've already changed the data
that's that's basically driving how all
this texture information looks like and
we will go through all of that and
explain what it what it is all about and
how we modify these things and how its
constructed so I hopefully by the end of
the hour people will have a much better
understanding understanding an idea of
how we approached is on v4 first let's
check out the color information of this
planet all right so that we are now
we're just looking at color this is the
only thing that's really interesting to
us right now
and so what what is it different from v3
to v4 one of the big big changes is the
way we can't like our entire content is
put together so what I mean by that is
the color that you see from orbit the
color that you see close up and then
where are all our objects scattering
groups and how are they laid out and
then what about the ground materials and
such and how how are they distributed
right so all these different layers of
content and how they are all constructed
and put together has changed I think
that's the that's the most drastic
change when it comes from v3 to v4 but
it is also the reason why why the
process is so much faster because before
all of these different things were
basically individual files and every one
everything was basically quite
disconnected from one another
but now with v4 the new approach is that
we have base data that everything like
basically two sets of data that we will
also discuss in a bit that everything is
based on so we take we take a very
simple texture basically and have it
drive everything that you see on the
planet except for stuff like locations
and outposts since they are not really
belonging to the nature of the planet or
the organic part of the planet your
essence they're all map on all man-made
right you know Pio eyes are added
afterwards by exactly so if I jump back
to the planet view here and let's maybe
first check out the painting tools so I
can select our painting tool here and
the mode is set to surface and you can
already see like a little highlight on
the planet and that highlight basically
tells me where I can apply color to so
if I just now randomly choose for
example white and increase the brush
radius so I can just click into the
planet once and you see that the color
is applied
now what's determining the area that
you're affecting and obviously you're
moving your mouse and it's selecting
different areas we can see what areas
you're selecting the blue but how is it
determining what you're hitting what
you're not hitting exactly so the thing
I just talked about which is at that
very simple texture that drives
everything is basically what is being
highlighted here and it's different
portions of that texture we can take a
look at it right now if you want to so
but before I do that I can basically
just go through and Stroke in here one
more time so you can see that you know
changes can be done quite easily and
very fast but it's it's good to take a
look at the text
now it's now in a tool called substance
designer where we generate most of our
content when it comes to grant materials
textures and so on it is entirely
procedural so you see like there's these
large chains of operations going on
starting from noises and then we start
modifying them and stuff like that
without going into too much detail here
but at some point when we start with a
simple noise like this one which is a
purlin noise we go all the way to the
right where it basically shows the end
result because the the entire graph is
calculated from left to right right so
the this part here is the result of it
so we end up at something like this or
rather something like this right and so
what are we looking at here I have
talked about one texture but we're
clearly clearly seeing two things and
what are these two if I visualize it
like this so basically I just took that
grayscale information from here and
applied a little color to it to make it
a little more obvious what this is all
about what we're looking at is the
temperature information of our planet
and to further visualize that I can
actually have a view on my sphere here
so let's say this is our planet I'm
trying to squeeze the windows that are
usually among the two two screens onto
one screen hey all right but as you can
see here the texture if I if I chose the
grayscale version of it right you can
see that the dark values of the texture
are at the top and bottom of the three
which is basically our North and South
Pole and around the equator also if I
view this texture here you can see that
here the top and the equator here this
correlates right because it's mapped on
the sphere right now so around the
equator we have the brightest values
which means the
preacher there is greater than it is
around the North or South Pole right so
we have kind of a representation of what
yeah what the temperature is like on our
planet and also these deformations and
such because you don't want it to be
simple there are all kinds of things
going on on a planet like mountains and
oceans and all of these things can
influence how the temperature can behave
on the planet for example if you go up a
mountain right you would expect the
temperature to drop gradually as you're
moving upwards so that was the top one
right simple temperature let's look at
the bottom one which is our humidity the
humidity and the temperature are
basically combined in the end and saved
out as one texture but that one texture
basically combines the data set this
this these two textures so the the
information of our temperature and
humidity so I can also visualize that on
our sphere here and you can see that the
humidity isn't simply a gradient going
from the North Pole to the equator and
then it it is it has a lot more breakup
to it there's a lot more variation going
on the humidity is also usually
influenced by things like the ocean and
mountains and such we could also
basically these textures are completely
artists artists driven like we can
create whatever we like if I decided to
mmm let's say if I decided to swirl up
that texture that would actually be my
humidity so I am entirely free to do
that
like nothing stops me from doing that
except for maybe our art director who
would really dislike me for doing that
so yeah but we we can do anything right
so that there's no limits but we try to
at least have it be based on some
physical phenomena like some some phenom
in weather and how mountains influence
these two and as I already said my
oceans and maybe wind currents and all
of that stuff so we try to work in as
much of that information into these two
and the more precise it is the better
but also we have to kind of watch out
and look for specific shapes that are in
there because if we go back to the
editor and pick our painting tool again
these shapes are precisely what the
painting tool will start picking up on
so if what if if there was no variety in
this texture
I couldn't get these interesting shapes
that you see on the planet or moon right
here so this texture gets combined and
exported and then it looks a little
funky it looks like this so but that
that doesn't really that doesn't really
matter in the end
it's really the individual channels that
the textures made of that matter to us
so why why can I paint on the planet
like this how how does the how are the
textures combined and how can I paint on
them so you see that the highlight is
around the equator now and it's because
around the equator I have a specific
humidity value which is different from
another spot on on the planet let's say
oh that is actually a good one we have
this brighter area and this darker area
here right and I can totally if I hover
above it you can clearly see that my
highlight changes that means that the
data underneath has changes is changing
as well from this spot to that spot
because of it if it was the same data
this would all be white or dark or
bright sand or dark sand and I can
further visualize that
by simply picking the planet and then
showing you here is the humidity so for
example here where we get brighter
values it's very humid and then here in
the darker areas it's very dry if I had
to compare that to let's say earth where
you have the same temperature let's look
at the temperature again because you can
you can totally see that we have mostly
brighter values here in the temperature
which means it's the there's a very
similar temperature in this region but
still I get a different look because the
humidity differs so let's say it is hot
and dry you would probably expect a
desert right but if it was hot and very
humid you would probably expect expect a
jungle
that's very lush and and the humidity
would be super high if you entered the
jungle so this is how we can control and
have variety even though we are in the
same region when it comes to the
temperature right if I hover just around
the equator you can see how that high
light never reaches the pole because at
the pole we have a different temperature
and therefore I can paint this area
individually from this area right
because it's taking a it's taking a
measurement between the temperature and
the humidity exactly because both both
datasets of temperature and humidity are
working together at all times they are
all they are being basically blended
together and they work at the same time
not not individually so you're using
both at the same time when your paint
what was that
gradient square we were looking at
earlier that gradient square if I find
it on the planet here it's right around
there yeah yeah it is it is basically
just the same data that is spread over
the entire planet if I just turn on
humidity again it's basically just the
entire data
from from the dark values to the bright
values from zero to 255 and it's
basically just condensed into a square
we are that's that's purely an artist
kind of workflow that we came up with in
order to depending on what we do save
ourselves some time and work because if
let's say I paint on this square you can
see that the entire planet changes as
well so if I wanted to save some time
and be quicker in my workflow I can
simply start filling out this entire
range here in this square because it
correlates to my entire planet so we can
we can we can try that out right I still
have my white color selected and I'm
gonna tint this top left corner of of
this square and now let's take a look at
the temperature okay
the temperature in the top-left corner
seems to be cold right mm-hmm and now if
I look at the humidity it is in that
case cold as well so we have or low so
it's not very humid and it's very cold
so how does like what area on my planet
describes very cold and dry areas if we
take a look you can see that the area
that describes this these two are
actually my poles if I check the north
pole and I've checked the South Pole
there's even some more areas out here
outside that also share this data so
they automatically get that color
applied right that I could do the same
for let's say very hot and dry places so
we would go down because it's hot and
then dry would be not dry would also be
here right yes we can already see that
the highlight is showing the exact same
spot that where it
viewing here right so it doesn't matter
if I hover my house hover my mouse over
here or actually on this on the square
because it's showing me the exact same
data and spot so you know in the end I
can just go in and start painting on
this square do very very little more
areas of modification very condensed in
just this little spot but actually I'm
influencing large portions of the entire
planet and changing them right away that
square it it doesn't you know it you
don't have to be it's really just an
artist workflow to speed things up we
can for example go in here and define a
couple biomes okay we have the snowy
areas in here or maybe we have scourged
whatever volcanic areas over here right
I'm just visualizing right now with two
colors and then that's how we basically
block in the individual areas that we
want as biomes right okay because it's
the hottest and driest here and the
coldest and driest here so that kind of
makes sense if you lit know a little bit
about weather conditions and temperature
zones and biome distribution when it
comes to planet Earth you know that
around here somewhere in between the
equator and the North Pole that which
there would be our temperate zone so
that's where most of Europe lies that's
where you have to brought leave and
needle-like pine tree forests and such
right so I could already go in and kind
of block that out and be like okay this
is where I want these areas to be right
and then maybe we're moving further up
to a Tundra a kind of environment so I
can start visualizing that of course
does not final quality at all but we
would first determine where do I want
these individual areas to be on the
planet and how do I want them to sit and
use the data that is provided to me with
the textures that I have actually built
myself right
so the
the painting pass and these two textures
they go together one determines how the
other thing looks or can behave of
course I can use the same data and do
different kinds of paint passes right so
technically and we do that on some of
the moons but the players never notice
because we give we give we can give them
the same data but give them an entirely
different paint path so they look look
different and unrecognizable it's
unrecognizable that they are actually
using the same data so for example I can
just go in here and be like okay around
my poles I want a region where it's just
just ice or something like that right
and it transitions over all the way to
my pine needle forests and then there
come the broadleaf forests or something
like that
right so we can we can decide quite
easily and quite swiftly where things go
so far so good
any questions Jarrod no I just you asked
me you know those who know weather and
stuff and I realized I live in Southern
California my whole life I don't know
anything about weather all right so it's
so good so your your your color coding
sections here yep how does that
translate into what players see because
obviously they don't see this it looks
like Microsoft Paint color over the
media right now right now it does
because I'm I'm basically just or
blocking in huge areas with different
colors right but if I just reduce my
brush radius right and then once I'm
very low like once I'm happy with the
entire layout of what I'm putting down
here I can then do like a second detail
pass of where things might go right so
I'm again picking the snow or white
again and I'm basically going in
and working on transitions or how how
does snow kind of blends in with all the
other areas right so simply just by by
clicking I can determine where these
things should go and then if we go down
now now now now now I can even go down
to a ground level where this is dark now
let me go to a spot where it's actually
bright so I can go down to ground level
maybe it let's show it here yeah
go to all the way down to a ground level
and then basically paint in quite
detailed areas of of snow where it sits
and how it blends into the entire rest
right mm-hmm as simple as simple as that
so that's actually we start off like
that but everything that the players see
on the planets right now and the entire
color and color information is actually
painted down like this by an artist it's
just that if I went back to that spot
again you know and I wanted to start
doing my detail passes I can for example
increase the smoothness here and then
reduce the opacity of the brush kind of
like you would know it from any other
painting tool right and then I can start
detailing these areas out or take like a
contrast again and add a bit more detail
and then you you can kind of see how it
picks up on a lot of the information
that is just that comes with the terrain
and I'm basically filling that
information with with color and that's
basically how artists go in and work
through the entire planet or that that's
that simple square that I have shown you
and until they get something like this
right so someone actually went in and
applied these darker darker areas of
sand and brighter areas of sand
but the important thing to note here is
that even if you know I'm looking at
this specific pit and this is a very
like some some artists have to wrap
their head around this before actually
starting to construct planets because
painting this area doesn't mean that I'm
just painting this area so if I if I
would just zoom out now you can kind of
see that I'm actually affecting a huge
portion of the planet just by painting
that one pit I would change the entire
area that's blue right now any any small
my new modification that I do to the
planet is represented everywhere
elsewhere at this spot the humidity and
temperature data is the same so if I now
enable temperature again
this is not very visible but there are
maybe maybe it is visible on stream
there's like very subtle grayscale
differences here do you see that your
yeah alright cool now let's look at the
humidity again
oh what a humidity is a bit more right
so you can see that the pit here has
different humidity values than those
protrusions or these these these hills
here all right so every single every
single height information that we have
on the planet that's basically covering
the surface let's say the mountains and
such hills or these mountains here they
are all coming with the same set of data
as the planet does and then we blend
them together and that way which is
which is super different from how how v3
worked let me demonstrate
so but people probably already noticed
by playing that I can simply go in and
let's pick some crazy color like this
mmm-hmm let's find a good spot like
maybe yeah like this right and now if i
zoom out all the way from ground to
orbit and can still see it you can still
see it it's still like it still
represents a pixel on your screen right
it's still there and the cool thing
about it is there's no blending
happening between a planet texture and a
close up ground texture which is which
is fantastic because that way we could
provide for details not just looking as
if they would represent what's close up
but they are actually what is there
close up as well there's no blending
happening in between this view and an
orbit view it's the exact same data
we're looking at there's no change
happening when I when I fly fly out of
the planet like this which was fantastic
I'm really liking that green I don't
know why would the green you you you
touched on a little bit of elevation
earlier a lot of folks in Cheddar asking
how elevation what how elevation factors
into any of this
so elevation is not factored in by
default but when I construct these two
textures like the temperature and
humidity right do you you see these
smaller darker bits here right mm-hmm
so in this in this live stream I
actually wanted to focus on these two
alone but we can also take a look at the
height information of that planet right
so now you have another representation
as a texture where where the mountains
are or where there's an increase in
elevation and where it's where it's
actually decrease decreased or like
these dark
values are lower the brighter values are
higher right so what I could do is
simply take that information give it a
bit more contrast like this so I can
actually work with it fully and now take
the temperature and then tell this
height information to be subtracted from
my temperature maybe let's do it like
this all right like this I could do that
and then the elevation of the planet
would be factored in to the temperature
of the planet simply by me putting in
that information from the height data
that I get into the temperature data and
now since I took the mountains and in
the temperature I said wherever
mountains are give me a darker value and
a darker value means coal lower
temperature so whenever you work up a
huge you know higher altitude on the
planet you would suddenly start
transitioning from these these brighter
values here over to the darker values
until it gets really cold and then you
know FX picks up on that and the wind
picks up on that and the color
information changes and the object
presets that we apply change as well see
this so you systemically change the
temperature by just mixing two different
textures yes because these two textures
this one describes elevation this one
describes temperature and if I mix them
in mix them together using using certain
math in that case it's simply
subtracting that texture from that
texture I get exactly what these people
in the people in the chat asked for
which is you know the height factored
into the temperature of the planet which
is cool
so yeah any other questions or should I
if yes I was watching I was mesmerizing
right folks are asking what happened to
the mountains on Hurston mountains on
the Hurston oh yeah yeah so I mean this
these painting tools are not the only
thing we have changed with before and
the fact that we are now applying our
content very differently to the planets
we had to adjust and align the content
that we use on our planets which means
the mountains the heights data and stuff
like that
it has it had to be all be changed in
order to work fine with v4 and that's
why you might see yeah you might see
different mountains or maybe the
elevation changed or maybe the look
changed or something like that
I mean it was a planet reworked after
all we actually went through all the
planets and reworked all of them and
like including the moons right um also
when whenever we talk internally of of
planets we usually say we usually also
mean the moons by it yeah I had learned
that the hard way that when that
internally you guys just refer to
everything's planets yeah because it's a
planet yeah and we just say planet to
everything you're painting right now
that this is the with the height map
included I've notice that the oh the way
it's selecting is drastically different
than it was linking before actually it's
not just it seems to be way more
striations now because I whenever I
change so I can increase the frustration
yeah so if I change the brush radius I
can cover huge areas at once right if I
want snow to bear to be there everywhere
and then leave these areas as you know
just very barren deserts and but still
super cold then I could do that but if I
reduce my brush radius you can still see
the highlight right but it's much
dinner now so now I can go in and really
detail out these places and that's what
we do towards the end of the process
because as you know I mean you have
probably seen enough art processors
Jarek to know that we usually go from
big to small from rough to super
detailed and that's just how all artists
on the entire planet work because if
anything that we do in regards to big
changes if we're not happy with them
then any type of detail we put into them
will not work either right so as the
base has to be established first before
we dive into any type of detail and and
start start tweaking that yeah you
always start big will it down small it's
like it's like sculpture or actually
even applies to acting you know I did
theater I did theater for three decades
and you know they'll always tell you
start big and let me let me bring you
down because it's a it's a lot easier to
bring to will something down than it is
to try to build it back up yeah yeah for
sure
should we do like an experiment which
would be very interesting to see so as
long as it doesn't end with something in
somebody's crotch yeah yeah I was afraid
of that let's let's hope it doesn't
happen but let's as we did before let's
let's quickly block out something here
right so I'm just gonna Josh Sherman are
you here yeah huh nothing oh okay
longtime viewers will know all right all
right as we did before I'm just gonna
apply a couple different greens here
we're like temperate regions would be
maybe like a darker green just to vary
it up a little like this
all right ah the opacity isn't up I see
okay so we could do something like this
and then for for these areas up here
maybe we will also take something darker
and just apply a couple details just to
have something showing I don't know
maybe exposed rocks or cliffs or areas
of whatever it could be yeah because
people volcanic regions or you know here
like and burnt forest for example right
could do that as well and then we leave
a little bit of desert and maybe a bit
more of that these green green zones
like this all right let's say that's
that's a bit of the the planet
information that we have just just to
for the sake of making the experiment
right and now imagine that this is
basically our planet and we're quite
happy with it even though this is just
you know blocked in information and it
would be interesting to see how the
entire planet changes simply based on
changes that we do to these two textures
right I will move move this one away so
we can kind of look at these so let's
first look at the temperature what could
we do to the temperature oh yeah of
course
right now it is quite earth-like we have
a North Pole and then it gets kind of
hot around the equator and in between we
have the forests right but what if we
simply flip the entire thing or I should
totally flip it here actually so now I
have flipped the temperature on the
entire planet we have the the poles
which are hot and the equator which is
cold
so now I can just export that texture
let me give a letter from Chery
alright and now you can see what
happened
so without in just within a second and
just a simple texture tweak I was able
to completely flip the entire
information that I have on the planet
and what's really cool is it is not just
a color information it is everything
that we have talked about a couple of
minutes ago so the grant materials the
the object presets and such everything
has rearranged automatically using the
new data so even if we are in fact
entirely done with a planet and we have
distributed all these rocks and these
plates and then we decided what ground
materials go and where and painted all
of these out and we did our detail
passes and yeah well the biomes are
blocked in any way right so even if we
have put in all of that stuff already
and we want to change something about
the planet then we can just do it as
quickly as I have just shown just plug
in the node do the moderate modification
that you want to do re export that
texture and you're good for the fun of
it let's change let's say oh maybe
something directional instead something
like this right but we will use it as a
humidity so if I view it on the sphere
you can see what happens on the sphere
right I will simply override the
humidity of our planet now entirely and
export that BAM
by one single texture change
I have heavily influenced the look of
the entire planet if I don't like it if
I'm like oh it's a little weird that it
you know my North Pole is is around the
equator no problem I'll just go in and
revert the change that I have done
re-export the texture done this is how
quick we can make changes in the end and
we don't have to worry about any of the
content that is applied to the planet
close up as I have already said it so if
you had forests in a section then you
moved the temperate area the forest
would move should we try yeah we will
have to reload the planet this is where
it can crash so let's hope that doesn't
happen we will wait for like 10 seconds
[Music]
[Music]
yeah well good and we didn't crash
fantastic using a built from a while
back as people know we're developing the
game but we're also developing the tech
at the same time which can be sometimes
quite crashy for us because when the
engineers you know build new things new
new tech it can be buggy at first and
then we simply have to live with the
fact that sometimes our builds might
crash so let's do let's do a forest you
said right yeah okay let's do the forest
in where should we do the forest let's
maybe paint down some specific color for
it like this this brown just to have
okay one second
oh no that's not the forest
that's not the color this is the color
okay and if I come close you will start
seeing the forest appear and it's dark
but it's no problem because I have the
power of the Sun okay cool so right now
there's the actually dis savanna from
Hurston se which we have which we have
applied on to this brown spot that we
have just painted so so literally you
just use when you pick the color brown
yep you set a brush size yep you select
it again again select an area based on
temperature and humidity and then said I
want this to be forest yep and it just
planted all these trees everywhere yeah
let's do this again but to close up this
time so people can actually see what's
happening so I'm basically just applying
a white color here and then I'm swapping
over to let's say obsidian set a from
Microtech and I just changed that I said
I want snow and our dark rocks on that
snow and that's my new that's my new
biome this is how quickly we can change
things with v4 of course there's this is
just one flat color right now I could go
in and really detail this out and happen
they give it different shades of like I
don't want to say grey now but I have to
say gray yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks
let's do this I'm gonna get fired for
this you know it wasn't my idea it was
from the chat oh alright it's yellow
snow I went in see a lot of yellow let's
say an elephant walked by and yeah
digestive problems or something
yeah but we can totally do these changes
in detail these areas out even more so
if I wanted to enhance this area and
let's say do cacti and I want it on the
transition between between this savanna
land and the dark shrubs I can totally
have cacti in between and it will first
go from the savanna areas over to the
cacti and now the now the grass is
spawning on on the snow which looks odd
right but just for demonstration
purposes no we've got high desert here
and occasionally it snows in the high
desert here so I've seen snow on
cactuses before oh nice
we have in California so yeah that's
that's that's how quick we can change
things and the thing is now I think by
now people get a bit of a better idea of
how fast v4 really is and how how much
we can do but we said we wanted to put
down some like a forest and then you
know now we actually put down two things
so we have these dark rocks and our
savanna right okay and now let's zoom
out and that's modify this so it occurs
in a different area so I'm gonna go back
and really like change my textures again
wait temperature goes here humidity goes
here and now I'm just updating that
texture again that didn't work for some
reason let's do it again ah now it works
yeah this thing needs to pop up in order
for it to work sometimes it gets stuck
all right so now you can see that it
changed right it just jumped it just
jumped a little because we changed the
data so if I go in here you can see that
this is not matching anymore and that's
exactly the reason why we have to reload
the planet because the object scattering
behaves
differently than simply applying colors
or I will have to just reload that
planet and then we will see the dark
rocks in these snowy areas here and the
forest around them it takes it takes
like ten seconds to reload of planets
yeah yeah yeah she's reliving a planet
okay now I can fly back in and do the
dirt you can totally see we have this is
wait a second
maybe here I will explain what went what
goes wrong here because we are in an
area where the ocean starts to the ocean
level starts to creep in and I'll
explain what happens precisely but you
can see that we have the dark rock and
then the savanna right next to it right
so this updated properly so why does
this why do we get the coral spawning in
here like why does that happen like this
is weird right I didn't paint this down
I didn't I didn't want this to happen
originally but what the objects can
basically read out and what they're also
driven by is what on what kind of
elevation on the planet they are sitting
on and we can basically turn objects on
and off based on what elevation level
they are on so the reason why you're
starting to see coral in this in this
area is because we are actually but
below ocean level we are very close to
being at ocean level the thing is
because this planet is based on de Mar
de Mer doesn't have an ocean right yeah
that's why we that's why we can simply
hover above the ground and and and
wonder but wonder about why coral
appears but it's actually good that it
happened because like then I can explain
that if this was let's say Microtech
this is how we can
that for example on a hill there should
be or on higher elevation there should
be these spruce tree a pine tree forests
that are completely snowed over right
mm-hm and then as you move down and
elevation towards the frozen ocean that
you find on Microtech we can for example
say okay add ocean level zero or minus
one we want and that's and meters right
we want ice blocks to spawn or you know
shifting ice sheets on the ocean and
that way we can detail out the ocean if
the ocean wasn't frozen we can simply
turn off the frozen ocean feature and
then you can actually see a different
types of assets spawning underneath the
ocean level how how hard is it they give
de marrón ocean we can we can activate
it but then the shader has to be applied
and such and it might not look great so
yeah now just just adding it there's no
problem I don't think that we can do it
in ten minutes though fair enough
and make and make look good yeah takes
longer than ten minutes to make an ocean
yeah but generally it can be if the
shading is as clear and if it's all good
and if it's all set up then it's that's
very easy especially if we can reuse for
example let's say we had default
earth-like water ocean set up then I
could simply just turn it on slap slap
something on it and that's it but right
now I'm not sure how how the ocean
shading is set up in this build because
this is a 3/8 build and that's when the
frozen oceans came in so I don't want to
just for not risking any crashes because
we did changes to the ocean in this
build I don't want to try but yeah let's
go over to this area here can reuse the
same assets if you have questions shoot
it's no problem let's go back here oh
this is
let's take a for example just for the
sake of doing it again he asked for
questions and right off the bat why so
many rocks ah no not that question why
so many rocks Patrick wait wait wait why
do you what do you know a rock did you
did you have a pet rock when you were
younger I loved rocks the more the
better so the rock situation yeah in v3
one of our big problems was that we
couldn't detail out environments as
nicely as we could and the more changes
we added the more and more we progressed
with the tech the more budget we we we
could free up and the tech change it
changed so we were able to put like
simply scatter more stuff than before
that's why people saw such an increase
of detail in the last two years when it
comes to planets in general so that's
when also the rock density on the
planets started increasing right and
then at some point it simply became a
problem because it started affecting
travursel mm-hmm for example something
like damar is fine you have some rocks
here and there but sometimes it's very
hard to predict where and how much of
these rocks will spawn sits something
like - it happens procedurally right but
there's there's still some things that
we need to figure out it's a discussion
point it's something that we will
definitely have meetings about and and
figure figure out how we can tackle the
problem because there's it is of course
a problem for design but then art
direction might want dense areas and
stuff like that so there's there's a
conflict there it's simply something
that we will need to figure out as all
the other stuff that we have talked
about over the over the last years and
try to find solutions and and we we
definitely hear the people we read what
everyone
um we reread what everyone is posting on
Reddit and and spectrum and stuff like
that so we totally hear you guys and we
will definitely find some solution for
it but it's it's too early to tell but
we are thinking about it that's that
that for sure what was the the black
when you were laying black it was a very
dark color almost looked like the
surface was burned a rock you mean I
thought the whole the whole texture the
planet was was was very dark it was
almost black oh yeah I just painted it
yeah painted it black yeah we're talking
they don't want to interrupt you and ask
you what it was and not no problem so I
basically just just did the same thing
as we as we did with the snow I painted
some darker values down on the planet
swapped to my object presets applied
some darker plates to it and here we go
like dark spots on the planet it could
be anything really petrified roots let's
say here we go again
I'm not only changing this spot right
here right so we are changing everything
that turned dark in this area on the
entire planet so it's never you're never
just editing one area that you're
looking at that's that's that's
something that people constantly have to
remind themselves of do you coming at
this from like a photoshop standpoint do
you have the ability to mask off a
section like if you want to change
everything on a planet except for one
specific area like I do not want to
change this area in terms of painting or
texture it's a painting paying for well
I'm thinking you have the ability to
mask off so the painting tool will pick
up on whatever the data is saying right
if you
let's say that just because like what
are what we are viewing right now let's
say this area right here I want to paint
it but I don't want this area to be
affected on the left here mm-hmm
then in the tool right now there is no
option to simply mask that area and only
paint that area because it is sharing
the same data right so it has to be the
same because it's it's the same it's the
same climate zone here the temperature
and humidity what rise on the left as it
is on the right so it has to be the same
has to be the same color and biome and
objects and and ground textures and
stuff like that but I can simply go in
find that spot on my texture here and
basically assign new values to this
region then I have let's say on this
region right and then I can paint them
paint them uniquely and individually
from one another like that I was asking
because I I was wondering if it's if
it's possible to write your name on the
planet like it I give you a if you had a
master you just mask out Patrick but
that's how would you like remember when
I asked you if artists sign their work
oh wow is there a way for you to
literally sign that's not what I said
I said Patrick
all right okay
this is a bit crazy but as I said
nothing prevents us from doing anything
so let's do this and swap our
temperature texture with that these
changes will go to damar live by the way
oh yeah there we go
the Jared biome but you ended up in the
desert region Jared I'm sorry me too me
too
because it's too hot you know it's too
hot yes yep see now we're starting to
get the idea but we can also just flip
it as we did before and have the snow be
in our names because now it's cold right
so it all you know it makes perfect
sense in that regard and now all the all
the other data because I gave our names
this gradient bevel here around the edge
as an effect right mm-hmm
so now the temperate forests empty all
the other regions are basically all
focusing around around our names because
it's going from cold to warm in a much
shorter distance instead of just going
from North Pole to equator we have
basically forced the temperature to to
change in a much yeah in a in a much
smaller area I'll give you I'll make you
a deal Patrick yep oh good I'll give you
I'll give you five dollars American
paint yellow snow if you take this image
and drop it in a review folder for and
at your next sprint check in just like
this is what I worked on in
okay let's talk about that off string
shoot me sure and maybe at a zero all
right yeah I think we have time for like
a last question or something or actually
we're pretty much done awesome we are
done you can go ahead and shut down the
the screen share if you want Patrick
thank you so much for taking the time
here on your Friday at the end of your
week to join us here for our game dev
painting planets if you haven't seen the
IFC segments from last week check that
out it was about how it was part two of
our core long moon series about the work
that Patrick and Pascal have been doing
to create three moons with but with only
two people in the span of a quarter this
hopefully this shows you a little bit
about how they're able to achieve that
those tasks at that at that at that
speed for weeks for weeks for weeks for
weeks and moons that's pretty good oh
and for people like like what about the
concept like the concept was done before
it's from concept to completion it
didn't include the concept it was from
concept we yeah we have seen that all
read it as well but it happens we only
started January when I came back from
holidays that's when we started on the
moons from on our end but yeah there was
a concept thing than before as you said
and you've you've made your you've made
your go/no-go and now it's in the hands
of system designers and VFX anything to
put on the finishing touches
yeah thank you a is checking it out
seeing if there's any bugs you know
anything that we might change maybe our
direction is gonna have some feedback
but not much and then hopefully yeah
people get will get it and and play
around with it and have fun
yeah experiencing new new moons and
without with all the new actor status
stuff they'll have to contend with the
temperature the temperature variations
so I can all but already spoil that much
the moons are very cold
very cool I don't think that was much of
a spoiler Patrick all right guys thank
you so much if for any reason you're at
PAX East we got Tyler and Molly are out
there and now they've got they've got
some giveaways if you track them down on
the show floor be sure you spot them
three eight to went live if you haven't
checked that out be sure you check that
out the kerrick's currently available
for all four if you're in a Parador
subscriber for instance you've got
you've got access to the to the
character the next seven days and no
additional fee as a member as a perk of
the imperatore testify program so
imperative subscribers can look forward
to that that's active right now until
March 8th so yeah so I'm Jared that's
Patrick that was JJ over there push the
buttons we'll see you next week
everybody take care see you bye
you
