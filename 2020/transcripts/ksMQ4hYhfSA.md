## Transcript

hi everybody
welcome to another episode of call of
nope see i almost did the wrong show
there
i've reversed the verse nope that's
it's one of those that really wasn't on
purpose that that that's me not knowing
the end of the show star citizen live
game dev
uh making mountains uh on the show
if you've never seen star citizen live
before we have a couple different
formats this week we are on our game dev
format
which is which is where we are going to
hang out with one of our
developers our designers our artists our
our
people who work on the game and explore
a little bit about their process
how they work and what they do for star
citizen
so joining me on the show this week is
no stranger to
star citizen live uh mr patrick gladys
patrick how you doing
oh good fantastic do you know the name
of this this time from home
huh do you know the name of the show
because i don't apparently star citizen
life star citizen live
all right so uh patrick you are a member
of the uh
uh planet content team the planetary
tech team
what's what's uh correct me there's a
bunch of different subdivisions
what do you do for star citizen let's
just go there
we are or i am part of the environment
art team specifically
the environment art team from the
germany office
and we almost exclusively handle all
all the things um organic
right so that means planets geology
vegetation and since we are the content
team that
almost exclusively works with all of
that stuff or produces all of these
things
we are also the team that drives uh the
planet tech forward in terms of
communicating with the engineers who are
actually programming and building the
planet tech
and so we we it's basically the
ping-pong game between the the two the
two of us
you know the engineers and us and this
is how yeah this is how
we operate all right and the last time
we had you on the show
we uh we were painting planets we were
using the
the new painting tools to show how we
can cover the surface of a planet
um there's going to be some aspect of
that involved today so
just in case you know for people who
have joined the project since then
or who didn't see your wonderful panel
it starts at a citizencon about it
uh before we get into this give us a
brief primer what what does it mean to
paint the planet
painting a planet uh meant something
else a year ago
than what it does by now as you know we
are constantly
uh pushing planet planet tech forward
and all the features that are coming
with it
um so painting a planet means
to a first um
actually do an artistic paint pass which
means applying color to the planet
and then what it means as well is
applying all the other pieces of content
that are necessary to complete a planet
as well through
painting and as i said when when we had
the star citizen live stream last time
where painting was covered all of these
individual pieces of content like the
color the objects and the ground
materials
all of them were painted individually in
individual passes
but since then a lot of stuff has
changed and we will see some of the
painting
in this live stream as well but i will
not go
into a super like much detail
but i will definitely show it off a
little bit
what we will mostly focus on um will be
the height map creation though okay
now the the we've talked a bit about an
isc over the last quarter
uh showcasing through sprint reports and
stuff how the
uh painting tools have been evolving you
know even since we
we showed it last time uh what are some
of the improvements
uh that have been made over the last
year
at this point uh probably the biggest
improvement probably would be um a much
simpler and more compact design of those
painting tools
which means that whenever we do
these painting passes and i told you you
know that all
all individual pieces of content have to
be applied or hats to be applied
separately
with that simpler design we basically we
basically pack
everything into one single brush so
um it's it's basically a reduction
like four or five times quicker you know
when we had to do
actually like five separate painting
passes before it's all reduced into one
now
and sorry and
uh the cool thing is um all the color
information
and everything is saved dynamically
in these brushes now so whenever we want
to change the color
or change the the objects or the ground
materials
we can do so after all the painting is
done and we won't have to repaint
anything so
it's not just a more compact design and
more simplistic design of
the of the brushes that we use and on
the painting tools
but it's also a much more dynamic so we
won't have to
do tedious reworks and and repaints of
something whenever we want something
changed we can simply
pick another color and we'll
automatically update all over the planet
and this will save us as i said lots and
lots more time
yeah i mean it was already pretty fast
before like the atlantic v4 came online
that was already pretty fast and then
to here we did a whole we did a whole uh
a segment on an isc and i think a lot of
the comments were
it goes they can't really be that fast
and it's like now we've made it even
you know faster and less labor-intensive
and the results
have gotten better i it's one of the if
you you correct me if i'm wrong because
i am the layman here but when i look at
the new results
when i'm looking at the before and after
shots
you know between you know the painting
with the new tools today versus the
painting with the tools that was done
just
a year ago uh it seems like things that
there's a much better
uh uh diversity in the elements
yeah you you see a much better breakup
between the rocks and the plants and the
the various foliage and stuff and the
different ground coverings um
the textures seem to be greatly improved
i'm not imagining that right the the
textures like the the gravel textures
and stuff we do and i showed this on ise
and i was that the gravel textures alone
seem to be way more detailed now than
they used to be
am i am i imagining this or am i right
no
actually not um we have we have actually
gone through i think it was two or three
weeks
and we have reworked every single
uh terrain texture that we had before
and replaced them with
i think it was 80 or 90 new ones
um that are not just reworked but
they are based on um
realistic data like photogrammetry data
it is actually photo scanned
real life material that that is now um
in our libraries that we can use and uh
it's it's it's much higher quality the
the definition on the ground uh is much
higher now so it's more consistent and
coherent with what you see on the rocks
which has also been improved and updated
and
you know it's it's one of these things
we are always try
picking picking in a couple elements of
our entire pipeline
um and thinking about like how can we
how can we improve this how can we
how can we raise quality make this make
this look nicer more consistent more
coherent and such and when it comes to
the painting tools
one important aspect that probably um
not many people think of right away when
when we talk about it or mention it like
this
but a speed increase for us
means that we have more time to iterate
right
if i have to do one paint pass instead
of five paint passes that means i have
five times as much time
or five times longer to spend on
this content and really polish it out
until it works
uh the way i wanted to and spend spent
more time raising quality polishing
things out
tweaking things adjusting so on so the
process of
the process of making it faster and
making
it better it goes a long way towards uh
one of the long-standing questions of
how are we going to make every planet
and every moon that we've set out to
make
it's it's it's this it's this you know
this growth curve of
you know as the tech improves and as
things get better and things get faster
that's how we're going to be it begin to
work at scale
and we're already seeing that in the a
bit in the creation of the pyro now
we're not we're not talking about pyro
here
but uh it's been it's been really
delightful to see
just how far you guys have been able to
come so quickly
uh as far as the the the groundwork now
and of course we will be
sharing more and more about pyro over
the next you know several months so uh
let's get to what we're doing today
we've set the table enough we've
recapped a bit and we've caught up with
other things
uh today you said we're exploring hype
map stuff
so uh at this point i'm gonna turn it
over to you for a bit
if you're watching live on twitch
remember you can submit questions
with the word question in capital
letters surrounded by brackets
and then our community management team
will pull it out and
send it on to us remember that patrick
is an environment artist
for planets and stuff so if your
question is about
uh when will this game feature come
online that this wasn't the show for
that if it's
it's when will space stations get this
he doesn't work on space stations it's
the planetside stuff so
planetside art related stuff that's our
topic that's the stuff patrick will be
able to speak to today
so patrick if you want to share your
screen i'll turn it over to you and i'll
let you uh
let you drive for a little bit all right
that's so do you see my screen in a
second
zoom is put it on the wrong screen there
we go now we see your screen
oh good you see substance designer yep
fantastic all right so um
as you already said jared we are going
to take a look at
um a bit more like an in-depth look when
it comes to height map creation
some of these things changed as well you
have talked about the citizencon
citizencon demo that we have done in
2000 i think by the end of
it was the end of 2018 i think so
where we showed off the the process here
uh but since then a lot of things
changed and it has to do with the swap
from v4 to no from v3 to v4
um and yeah uh we thought let's let's
have a bit of fun
let's create one of these height maps
from scratch and uh by the way explain
some of the changes that have happened
how it affects us as the art team how
much time
we get back from this how it affects
quality and so on and so on
you know so yeah how how
how would you describe this shape what
would you say this shape looks like
this shape looks like a paraboloid
this is official like this is you you
can basically
swap uh shapes here and the official
name for this shape is a paraboloid
terrible but uh i refer uh to it as
a simple blob so all right
not very scientific but whatever uh
so yeah let's take a look at the editor
real quick
so this is a slightly modified version
of
microtech that i have here and if i fly
around
you can see that i have my my blob
paraboloid shape um
on the planet already looks very natural
looks very natural right but this is
usually
um you know or one of the many ways that
you could start with
um what you can see though is that you
know the
how the color is distributed if you look
at all the other height maps around it
you have you have decent you know
visuals
it kind of all makes sense you can see
that there are mountains and then there
are valleys and they're filled with some
gravel and such and it all follows the
shapes nicely and
so uh the same thing happens for this
shape but
you can see how this flatland here that
has this swirly like a swirly pattern to
it
kind of creeps up our
our half sphere here and it has to do
with
how um our height maps blend together
it's not like we can simply produce or
throw in this height map texture and it
will always be
the exact same or this exact
uh cutout and visual because a lot of
things happen
in the editor on top right that might
influence
the the visual or the look of our height
maps
um let's take a look over here
you can see that this blob appears many
more times
all over the planet and since it's
really geometrical shape the data
that you can see on it looks kind of
janky right now
uh sometimes a very young planet and
it's
preteen years going through some acne
issues
something like that but you can see that
you know sometimes
these shapes blend together sometimes we
get
we get multiple frequencies of these
things blending together
and forming entirely different
formations
and this is this is the um this is
something we have to take into account
um but it's also the beauty of of our
planet tech in general because
from one height map by shifting it
around and making it blend with itself
and blend with all the other surrounding
height maps
we get very very nice happy accidents
like these that produce
very interesting results
so let's go back to our original
one here so as you can see
we have this elevation and it's it
resembles exactly this texture
um the dark pixels basically mean
there's
no elevation happening or basic or dark
pixels mean
in this case because okay i won't get
into two
crazy technical details here but if you
look at this one
i have changed the the values of it
slightly so the dark is gone
right so why why did i do that
um if the pixels here on on the on the
outer outside of our blob were dark it
means that
the height map on the planet surface
would
actually be pushing down but if we want
a flat mountain that is simply just
bumping up
then we have to constrict it to
a gray gray color value
and from gray upwards our height maps
will be bumping up
and grey downwards they will be bumping
down
i can demonstrate this quite easily by
for instance just
famous last words here i can demonstrate
this easily
yeah yeah so minutes
no no no no no i'm a professional
those are other famous words
i'm risking it right all right
so i have just added another
tiny blob and i'm going to put it in
here you can see that
the gray is our default base plane and
now that i have added this
these dark pixels you can see that this
blob here
is represented and it actually bumps
down might not be super visible but
oh wait i forgot this one so now now you
can clearly see that it bumps down right
so um this is fundamentally how we have
to
think of uh the text or textures and
all the colors or the the values and our
height
textures this is actually something you
know it's not specifically to us this is
this functionality is very very common
in in most game
engines and and other games are using it
precisely the same way
so yes let's revert this one back
and you can see it updating
right and if you if you made the uh
the second blob there a
lighter color it would be a another
mound next to it
uh yes precisely um
a lighter color
yeah you could easily you could easily
for example
add multiple elements like for example
i'm increasing the tiling here
and now i have four of them on one
texture so what happens if i export this
right i'm just going to export this to
the engine right now
and then you can you already see that
something happened
but the height map didn't update and it
has something to do with our planet we
have to reload the planet
that goes quite quickly and we do have
our four
blobs and the cool thing is all the
color and
everything else is adjusting dynamically
to it within a second
so i don't have to manually go in or
retweet something or adjust the the
trees
or the ground materials or or anything
anything really
i can dynamically swap out this thing
with um
anything i like but uh yeah
these are just um
these are just a couple likes very
simple geometrical shapes so how can we
make this more interesting
um just to also demonstrate
how we could attempt to to
if if it really was like a single
mountain like this one
or a single large hill or something how
could we make this more interesting
we have a couple nodes in substance
designer that allow us to detail these
things out for example like
terracing node most of these nodes
and are a couple of of them um we have
built ourselves to
um yeah simplify the or speed up the
process
and and have things that allow us to to
simply put in the details that we need
or like
um other other games or in in
like previously in the very beginnings
when i joined early on we weren't even
using substance designer for it but we
decided to go for it because
it's um it's a it's very nice
we can basically replicate if we are
missing anything
we can replicate it in substance
designer build our own custom nodes that
do precisely what we need
instead of diverting back to another
software and that keeps our
pipeline quite tidy and nodes are really
useful uh for for
for going back and identifying and
tracking changes that happened
you know six seven eight nine steps ago
exactly and it's all dynamic yeah so
this looks more
like a cake now but let's export this
one
yeah so i've added i've added terracing
now right like a cake
see this looks odd but if i reload the
planet one second
bloop and we have our cake on the planet
and you can see how the color again
automatically adjusts
and the bedrock is automatically sitting
on or
being applied where the slopes are but
you you can also see that there's this
part here
where it's where it's you know it's not
these layers are not continuous and
that's something
i mentioned before is the the
surrounding height maps they start
blending into that height map in order
to fuse
all of the elements together to not have
any weird seams or cutoffs or hard
repetition
we blend all of the data together so
that in
in the end it looks like a nice
continuous consistent
landscape
so this is still quite geometric
uh although i've seen and i've seen
things like that
before i i grew up next to a uh a quarry
actually as a kid and oh nice and and
the mountain
what started as a mountain at one point
ended up being a very terraced
looking thing as they were slowly you
know systematically
ripping into it so i've actually seen
that exact structure
very similar to that structure in real
life not naturally occurring but
yeah oh let's let's make this more
similar to what you
know then um because i can invert the
entire
thing right and then this is
a little more query like but still very
geometric and unnatural looking
and i have to adjust these values
because it's still bumping up and not
down so that would actually result in a
very very
awkward um visual so i'm tweaking these
the quarry i was talking about was
actually a mountain it was when i was
oh when i was five it was very big and
when i was 10 it was smaller when i was
15 it was smaller
and actually drove past it about two
years ago for the first time in a decade
and it's almost completely gone now
they've almost completely just destroyed
the mountain
but but when i was growing up it looked
very much like that they were
systematically
whittling it down terraced by terrorists
by terrorists
but yes this this also looks like this
looks like the traditional dig
you know down yeah yeah this is how i
know quarries there's a big one
close to my hometown and they they look
more like this
um so
what i have done now i basically
inverted the entire thing
and defined the ranges here
so that we have our grain gray default
plane and all the other values here
are just getting darker and darker and
darker which means
it's bumping down
so this is what we get so now we get
this white
plane um cutting through
so what could that be right um it is
actually the ocean level
we have bumped down our height map so
much that we are hitting
um that we are going past the ocean
level
all right so so the system at this point
automatically fills the ocean in but
what if you were
is there a way to cut the ocean out of
this
because there's no ocean around you
obviously
we have a method of cutting in holes
into the terrain specifically for caves
and such
i think it also works for the ocean but
generally we don't
do that because we simply by adjusting
the entire elevation of the planet
we decide where where the ocean should
show up and where
it should not show up yeah so uh yeah
and then i told you about our custom
nodes uh
so we can take this and transform it to
something more natural looking
right so i'm going through oh from
something very geometric
and i can adjust these uh i can adjust
that noise that frequency that we are
adding to these edges here
to produce a more realistic result so
what is that note doing like it's
basically
taking the existing information and
starts
pushing these things in and outwards
based on
based on a noise based on a mathematical
noise
something like this
okay
uh how what like let's say
something similar would be this here
wait i'm gonna take
another of our notes which is called
vortex
and i can for example put in
whatever really
let's do it like this
so i have this noise up here and i can
put it into the vortex node and it's
driven by this bottom noise and by
adjusting this
you can see that i can start
swirling and moving the existing
information around
so this is something very cool that you
can do
very interesting alien or even
lava formations with i hooked it up into
um an inflate note now so all
all the bits and pieces if you look if
you look at this
string here it gets inflated
so now all these shapes are pushing into
one another and creating a more like
like like something is flowing or
something has been pushing these
these things around like a dry it looks
like a dried lava bed to me
yeah yeah like lava had been through
here before
you know and it's all dried and cooled
so just for the fun of it
let's put it in here
this is looking very very harsh right
because we didn't adjust our ranges but
if i do so
if i give it a more reasonable range to
live in
i can constrict it maybe even further
because these
these shapes are quite quite intense
okay so now let's export that
and take a look at it here you can
already see the data adjusted
there we go but the height didn't so now
i reload and the height adjusts
and there we go
see i didn't even detail this out uh at
all
but it's giving me quite a funky result
so if we ever
were to do and a weird alien planet that
has these odd shapes due to
very harsh wind they're all aliens
we are also an alien planet
that looks cool yeah right it's
something that we
uh we don't have yet
it's a good example it's a good example
of how the existing tech can be used to
push things in new and exciting ways
right not not everything new
requires new tech you know so you know
there's still a lot of
there's still a lot we can pull out of
the tech that we have at this moment
so if we go back to
to our little quarry
um this is with the
landform node applied so this noise that
starts deforming everything a little
and then i hook it up to a sediment node
which adds a little bit of sedimentation
on top so you can see now
it's like the the soil started
sliding down a little and accumulating
then similar to how we did before with
the swirly shapes we can
can inflate or deflate this a little to
to sharpen up some of these features
and then export again and check in the
editor
and the cool thing is someone can be
let's say
uh pascal pascal is uh
also not unknown um
he has been on various shows multiple
times right so let's say he
he's working on the actual painting of
the planet
while i am defining out all the local
height uh data and information just as
we're doing right now
and i'm just working through it and then
pascal comes by and says hey you know
what
i finished the painting and i get his
latest changing changes
uh from the server and
i see all my height maps with pascal's
updated painting
within like literally 30 seconds i just
need to reopen
i might need to reopen the editor one
more time but uh that's about it
so now now that we have applied huh i'm
just saying this i was muttering to
myself this is pretty cool
and uh yeah now since uh we have uh
we have applied this noise to the to
this geometrical shape that we had
before and it looks
a lot more natural now i think it's
something similar to the mining pits
that we already have on
hurston now that i think about it
there are some mining pits on hertz yeah
they might not look exactly like this
but they feature similar visuals yeah
i like this one a lot uh one of the
questions from the chat
how many of your nodes do you have that
are custom made
or scripted and uh do you have a
favorite node that the did you like a
go-to node
so the custom ones that only i did
are are these one and one two three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
eleven
twelve thirteen and then there are a lot
of notes that sebastian did you know
because he's the techie guy so these are
my non-tech artist notes that just give
me
funky visuals but he he does like crazy
stuff he does
he does the intense things like um
like almost simulations on a 2d basis
for example
or erosion node
so let's for example oh let's let's do
something a little
more from scratch so let's combine one
of my notes with some of sebastian's
notes right
so let's go for the landform node and
let's let's take a look at
a simple noise sorry if you hear the
emergency cars it's uh
frankfurt central so we have a very
simple up and down
and i'm putting it into this landform
node and i'm
exaggerating the node properties here
and you can see how
the existing data gets shifted around so
this
is a very cool note because i can
basically
make something very terrain um
very terrain-like or very believable
terrain
out of just two nodes see how because
the the idea behind this note was
how do land masses form right that
messes formed by
you know constantly or not constantly
but sometimes
being moved around or shifting into one
another and deforming and fall
like even faulting and all of that stuff
so i thought like how cool would it be
to just have one note that simply gives
you that result
in an instant right yeah so this is
already quite believable
uh when it comes to the basic shapes and
and now i can take this and further
detail it out but before we do so let's
let's just simply check it out in the
editor as we always do
because ultimately how it looks like in
substance design designer doesn't
interest me that much i need to know
that it really looks great
in the editor right oh so now
like another one of these happy
accidents happened
i can see my my features but what what
happened here
right i can i can double check here
these values are all like be below gray
right so this thing should be bumping up
but it's bumping down
so i need to adjust that
maybe adjust the range just not have it
be too extreme
oh actually like this sorry
okay and
there we go now you can see the the
visuals that i get in in the substance
design of viewport are already
highlighting these tips red that means
you know they're high
so it's it's high elevation
so i can export this again and
you know this is already quite
interesting i don't i don't hate this
right
uh if i reload again just by changing
these values
i get a completely different visual
suddenly like you know
it's it's it's bumping up my landscape
this look how it looks from the top you
know you can see these forms deforming
and shifting into one another
it's quite cool it's a very good base to
work uh to work from
the the scale is interesting because
when we look at it in substance designer
it's it's it's i i'm seeing it on like a
much more like
macro scale when i see it when i saw
what you were in
designer i i see that and i look at
something like that and i expect that to
be like an entire mountain range
and then because this this uh
uh this particular height map is only
mapped to this one little area here
it's actually a much more condensed
thing
i don't know i don't know if i'm
explaining myself uh but
uh remember when i told you about how
our um
our height maps are splattered on the
planet and sometimes if there are two
right next to one another they will be
blending together as well
so we can check that out as well here
like simply by flying over and seeing
how it all behaves
so look at this
this is the exact same height map but
it's but it's
it sits here multiple times
and blends together and forms an even
greater landscape even
greater mountain range
instead of just being a single dot on
the planet that gives you that
that individual mountain and then you
know if
i would like to detail this out let's
take one of these tools here and this is
where we
and we're not getting into the painting
as much now but um
if i wanted to i can take us them heavy
spruce tree areas and be like okay you
know what i want the
spruce trees to live on this plane here
and i click in here once and there we go
spruce trees some of the stuff
some of the other things are bleeding in
you can see
that has to be adjusted so um this is
where you know
we start polishing things out and such
really clean that up
and this is without any detail passes
and you can kind of see that here that
the data looks
and even after the detail pass there
might be some areas where you get to see
um wonky wonky color application like
this
um but again all of this stuff are the
bits and pieces that we continuously
look at and and be like okay how can we
improve this
um let's polish this out let's improve
this and
we are making progress so all of that
stuff that uh you might encounter on the
planet
and to look like huh what's what's
happening here and you know we are
probably looking at it
at it already and and figuring things
out for it but we have our priority
lists
that we need to work from uh
so let's take the same mountain and we
said we would like to
reuse one of um sapp's node
nodes this is like a really cool node
erosion it really applies yeah no what
it what it says it
applies erosion to
to whatever you put into it so let's
give it a couple values to work from
sediment strength zero thermal erosion
angle
let's go for something like
this and i'm bumping up the iterations
here and setting this
up
and trying to see what it gives me
see if we can see something in the
viewport
okay uh
let's try something something is
off i'm gonna try something else
okay it's no no no big deal though
um it is something
oh yeah we can show the diamond dynamic
flow this
this is also very similar to erosion and
quite visible
and doesn't need to uh to to render as
as
long so let's increase the flow depth
here
so you can see now that what what
happens what would happen if um
you know rain started having an effect
on the site map
and i can hook it up to this flow node
i'm gonna enlarge this here and you know
white is the peak of our mountains and
then
the dark it gets the lower we go but you
can see that
i can dial in this this hydraulic
erosion this flow here
as i like it's a very complex node
very cool stuff definitely increase the
quality of our
existing height maps a lot so what i can
do with this now
is i can dial it in subtly and now
pipe it in to our export nodes
and then you get all of this stuff right
a lot more detail but what looks like a
subtle
you know like a subtle blend here is
actually quite extreme in terms of
elevation so i need to dial it back even
more
until i i get a result that i like see
this looks
a lot a lot healthier now
maybe even lower you know the
the player experience is something that
we have to really consider
at this point as well because when we
create these height maps
uh we are speaking of you know elevation
changes
and frequencies and also bumpiness
so if i was ever to do
something crazy like
like this
you know if if i would really like our
backers to hate us
right
you know have fun driving around in here
right
that's obviously an extreme example uh
let's see it oh you really want to see
it
oh my god let's see it you know
oh god jared is always making me do
stuff guys
it's crazy hey you're lucky i don't make
you do devil's town
please don't please don't fire me for
this
okay all right
it's quite bumpy i have dialed it i have
dialed it down a lot but it's quite
bumpy
could probably exist i know this is
another height map already let's go over
here
there it is there it is you know so this
this doesn't work
um but it's it's fine i mean we also
wanted to talk about limitations and
what we can and cannot do
right yes just because you can do it
doesn't mean you should do a thing
no absolutely not and we have our strict
rules and
uh for our workflows to prevent these
visual errors from happening
right because first of all how would you
drive your cyclone
through this right it's crazy it's not
this is this is not enjoyable at all
um i mean rocks are already an issue
right which we try to solve now
which is great uh but you also see that
the data it's so
it's so much elevation data and the
the contrast that that is happening here
um and the planet tech picks up all
these little things and starts
starts jamming all this data in between
these crevices and cracks so
this is something that we should
definitely not do so you know uh
we are very very cautious but let's
let's go for
um yeah let's go for it the same thing
but a more healthier
approach yeah now it's it's it's a
question showcase that
it's good to showcase that it's it's
it's always important to remember that
you know that it's it's one of the
reasons you can't leave
a procedural system up entirely to the
procedural generation
it's why these things have to be
validated by artists
and level designers and stuff like that
because you know
the the full breadth and scope of what's
capable is not necessarily
always a good thing it's you you have to
use
tools responsibly and we just showed a
very irresponsible use of the tools yeah
so that
that was useful that was good okay but
let's show a more responsible uh
approach right so
another note because if we if we don't
if we don't detail things out um
these areas will look a little you know
a little flat and the
the planet tech needs little pixel
variation to pick up on all of these
little
crevices to to achieve things like these
where
where one biome is creeping in through
the crevices of another biome
and therefore creating this this
interesting mix right this result right
here for example
um so we cannot leave it too flat but we
also want it to have a reasonable amount
of detail which is what we have done
with this note now so i've added the the
flow
right which is still in there but now i
have thrown
uh maybe maybe let's maybe show it again
so this is without
this is with just the flow um
also based on one of sep's node and then
the detail
soil node which which i have built to
just quickly generate
some of that close up nice a break up on
top and i can basically
decide if i want a simple noise
um or if i wanted to be
a more of a dry soil look
so now i can sharpen this up
and reduce the opacity here this is
something we have to do individually but
you now you see that
it resembles more of a
more of a dried out patchy kind of look
right so again like maybe
before
yeah this is without and this is without
some detailed soil application
right now see it's just these little
tiny bumps they but they do make a
difference
they absolutely do make a difference
because our new painting tools
they can pick up on the slightest pixel
variation and therefore we can
assign biomes to you know i could
probably
assign a biome to to this patch and this
crevice individually you know and and
in in the editor that would be a couple
meters apart
um so yeah let's export that again yeah
let's get rid of our nightmare terrain
uh if you have any questions uh i'm
going to take them gladly
folks have been asking if the system
allows you to paint a planet
and automatically use the correct
material based on a planet temperature
size atmosphere and stuff or do you have
to
go in and set all those things
individually each time
so it is something that we have been
discussing in the team as well
and yes there is a uh there is an option
uh
you you see that okay let's let's let's
i have destroyed uh don't don't uh
we have wrecked i have yeah we have
wrecked it a little yeah that's
but that's fine um
if you take a look at this square over
here right it's something that we have
already discussed right
um i can take for example the
obsidian dark biome and paint it down
and you can see that it automatically
gets applied here
right so what we could do because this
texture and each and every corner of
this texture
resembles um specific humidity and
temperature
situations uh like
the top right is cold and dry
the bottom right is uh hot
and dry the bottom left is um
cold no wait cold dry
uh hot dry cold wet hot wet
warm dry warm wet and then cold
wet yeah exactly so i could basically go
in
and and paint something
paint something in that resembles the or
that would uh
logically resemble some um
climate for example if if it was earth
right
uh i could where it's where it's cold
and dry i could put my arctic areas and
really
paint this square out completely
unrelated to any of
any planet or or anything really and
then we could throw any data at it and
it would
redistribute this data logically
so no we don't the the answer would be
we
we don't have to go in and adjust the
painting
all the time and repaint our biomes and
because you can see
even even after or even only this
local height map here it already adjusts
to the new data and the same thing
is happening globally so it's the it's a
very
sorry it's a very very same logic be
being applied there
so just by adjusting our workflow
slightly we could totally do that
yeah yeah so this this height map that
we've been working on
uh we've seen that it's it's in this one
place we focus on but we also
have seen that it's replicated in other
places yeah
how how what's that breakup like
how many different patches are there on
a planet how do you how do you keep
these things from being
too repetitious oh
the power of death tools um
you can see that what we have been
adjusting and modifying right now
is uh index or patch number three right
you refer to it as patches uh it's
actually okay
um we tweaked patch number three
right next to us it is patch number zero
and let me show you something um we have
a list
in our planet editor tools whoops
let's actually put it in here
so this is something that we should that
we don't show off quite frequently but
you can see that we have
our ecosystems and what we call as
ecosystems are all the height maps
right this is the list of all the hype
maps that we use on all our planets we
have
we have hills we have ice dunes we have
the mining pit
or you can actually also let's let's do
it properly here
you have a preview of all of it here you
have
the mining pits you have mountains
eroded and all of that stuff right
so it's it's a it's a huge library of
fightments
all kinds of flatlands speeches and so
on and so on so what i can do
is simply select that second
patch and for instance fill it with
um
fill it with something entirely
different which is uh
let's do mountain billowy mountain yeah
mountain billowy o2
that's my favorite all right
let's jump back to our spot oh that was
actually three not two sorry
three oops and now turn this off so you
can actually see what's happening
and this is a good demonstration of the
question that was asked previously
see these are the billowy mountains and
you can see that the data already
adjusted but if i go back and
put in something entirely new
now
see everything moved with it
um let's take some let's take a height
map that you guys have actually never
seen before
it's not on any of the current planets
yet
you saw it here first
see i can just i can just go through
this library and decide like okay
what mountains could fit best right and
i can i can define
uh as as i've shown before
so you see these funky colors right it's
0 to 15 so
we have 15 patches 15 slots that we can
fill
so i can decide on a lineup of 15
different height nets that's yeah
there's a single volcano
right here now it's 15 different height
maps but each height map is used
differently as well yeah we can
it's not just a repeat every 15. that's
cool
get closer to that i want to see that
you can see where bedrock is
automatically we get these bedrock
assets
spawning in and defining out these
slopes because you know
it is just displacing
upwards so if you want more silhouette
from it you have to
put assets on top which we scan scan
sorry
scatter on top procedurally as we do
with anything else
and that's how we can detail these out
uh yeah so before i asked you to zoom in
on that we were talking about how
each version of those 15 are still
different from each other
uh different different type yeah it's 15
unique individual completely different
heightmaps
yeah but but each version of three is
not exactly the same
as we've seen the beginning how how does
it how does it make each version of
that three different okay so um
it is it is the exact same texture every
single time
but if i get in that
volcano again
then it's like like when we had that
blob at the beginning
some places we had one blob some places
we had two blobs some places
exactly exactly and together um maybe
that's not the best
let's take this one for instance
not very visible too yeah the blob was
probably the best example for that
but fundamentally it's the thing that
i've already explained to you
um let's show this one again so
the third patch here is isolated right
there is no third patch around it but
if we check this spot for example
there are two two patches um
next to one another right so what we do
in
like what the planet tech does for us
let's take these mountains for instance
it takes a height map and then it starts
shifting it around
and then it starts blending it with
itself so you get you will get to see
uh a somewhat new and unique look
every single time you pass by the
sitemap because it's
it's blended together with its
surroundings in
a new way every single time so yes it is
it is a little different every single
time but it's still the same texture
we we just you know we uh have these
tricks and
and processes that that allow us to make
it look super unique by shifting the
information around
blending it with all its surroundings
and the cool thing is
every other height maps do the same you
know and
by by that you get this huge mumbo jumbo
of of
of blended height maps and every
everything looks kind of unique
that's cool so so so one version of
three
is blended with two and four so it looks
one way and then another version of
three is blended with 14 and 15.
so it looks different every height map
affects
all the other height maps that's cool
high students yeah
so um i think
unless you got one more thing to show us
we're actually done yeah i actually i do
have one more thing to show
i think i think it's really cool example
to show um
we have been working on on very very as
you can see
we have done this tiny example here
right we have done the blob we have done
this um
what we have what we see now
so this is another graph let's take a
look at this
um this one for example is utilizing a
melt note that we have
that kind of streaks through our
terrains and and resembles more or less
some
something like a lava flow or something
you know it could be something volcanic
something that we
use quite often um but let's
show something that we have done for
pyro
um and i believe the
the specifically that one height map we
have already shown
um in some updates already
now mind you we're not going to see pyro
we're seeing a pyro no no
as applied to micro attack exactly so
you you see how small these graphs are
and how simple they
are and what what kind of sim you know
what cool results we already get from
this you know this is really powerful
because with just a couple clicks you
know i can throw a couple notes
one two three whatever and then i get a
reasonable result from it so this is
what we wanted to achieve
again speed right speed and quality um
and our height maps like for all the
game devs that i might be watching out
there our height maps are only
uh 1 000 by 1 000 you know 1k resolution
basically so uh it's not like we can
push for
crazy amounts of detail no it's actually
2k but still
um our height maps are 2
uh roughly two by two and all the other
data is one by one so
it's not like we can push for crazy
amounts of uh detail
so this is this is this workflow and
this approach we're taking is perfect
for us
but let's take a look at a more defined
graph you can see that there's a lot
more going on
you know it's uh
it yes it's it's a these decently long
um decently long substance graph but
it's
it's still super manageable and and uh
and okay and the this is the result we
get from this
um let's uh push this one away because
we want to focus on that
guy so we have these mountains there's
some heavy erosion going on right you
can see that
we have um we have some some wind
erosion or some type of erosion that
started
eroding one side but not the other
indicating that there's there might be
some winds going on or
soil sliding down the hill as you can
see by these streaks and such
and something that you already mentioned
jared is you know we can always go back
to a node
and then change an aspect about it and
then
generate a completely new heightmap from
this so let's say
i'm super happy with the result and
everything works as
i wanted to and now i'm going to work on
pyro and let's say we need
15 of those right because we have 15 no
sorry 16 slots
right uh so let's say we need 15 of
those okay so
i can basically be like okay i'm going
to take this um
and simply you know
change the seed a random seed so it will
simply generate a new variation of the
very first node
but since that changed all the other
notes will change as well
and in the end as you can see now i'll
get a completely different result
by just changing a single value i can
produce a completely
new height map again not something
specific to us
this is very like by now this is
standard in the entire uh games industry
procedural materials
um this is this is how
most material artists work but we are
applying this to height maps
so now i can for instance change this
from a basic noise to a billowy noise
and it will again completely alter the
look
of this height map and give me an
entirely different result i can also
flatten it out if i want something
flatter okay this is a little too
extreme right
but let's say i go down with the octaves
and and restrict
the range something healthier here
because not all the mountains are using
the entire range of our spectrum
and there we go
see just by adjusting two things quite
quickly i can produce
uh an entirely new result if i'm happy
with this i'm exporting it to
the editor which i can do
validated on the planet
oh i have actually replaced it so i'm
going to
get back to it there it is plop
did i export it
export again and of course it's
important to remember that
this is a hype map that's being designed
for the terrain of pyro and not one that
was designed for the
terrain of microtech so uh the finished
result you're gonna see here is
not exactly uh the no this is yeah this
is just for demonstration purposes right
but you can see that parts of the height
map are showing and other hearts are
hidden because
it's blending into all the other
heightmaps and
uh yeah as we already mentioned a couple
of times all the biomes all the spruce
trees here
um i can for instance now
take an obsidian area and
paint it in here if i like to right and
change the entire um biome and object
scattering that we have
on this specific area and yeah this is
this is how we go about the creation of
height maps basically these procedures
these workflows going back and forth
validating in substance validating in
the editor
uh checking if our um if our biomes are
painted down correctly and if they
if the if the data like these streaks
here if it all picks up well if it's not
too noisy
making test drives on these right will
people hate us or not
so this is this is basically how how we
go about these things
yeah this is it and i think we're done
jared right
yeah we're done awesome any questions
any closing
no we're we're out of time you can stop
your screen share okay cool
i know that that's me that's that's two
of me
let's go back hi uh so yeah so patrick
thank you so much for taking the time
uh to be here on the show with us this
week um
uh as as usual you know uh with uh
stress in live we always like to
vacillate between the
q a shows and the game dev shows where
we showcase your process and i think
i i really enjoyed it and i think
looking from the chat the folks really
enjoyed taking this look at
you know just how how how something as
seemingly simple
as a height map is a little 2k texture
file uh
sits at the basis of a whole lot of what
they see
uh as the basis of every planet so
that's very cool um
as we usually do we are going to throw
uh the raid to a star citizen streamer
who's broadcasting right now
uh i understand it is the dark law uh so
if you see so if you're sitting here and
you're watching
uh live on twitch you should see a
little raid indicator go up in the chat
there
go ahead and jump in there and when that
starts tell them
uh what what what should they tell for
the dark law when they rate him patrick
what does he do what's he up to i
actually don't know the dark law very
well
i assume he's a he's a law enforcement
person who operates at night ask him to
do limbo or something like that i don't
know
i don't know i do know he's playing a
311 ptu today so you can check that out
and uh just just tell them uh
patrick says patrick says uh hello
saying hi take care everybody see you
next week
have a nice weekend bye
you
