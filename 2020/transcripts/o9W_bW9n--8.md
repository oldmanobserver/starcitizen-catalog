hi everybody welcome to another edition
of star citizen live all about alpha 3.9
I'm your host jared huckaby and joining
us on the show this week is star citizen
live game director mr. todd papy Todd
how you doing on hello good to see you
we had some unintentional red versus
blue thing going here this is actually
orange so no okay well all right we're
gonna have to check the color on our
monitor here all right only I look at it
okay if you've never seen Star says in
live it's where we take questions from
you the star system backer impose them
directly to our developers you submit
your questions in one of two ways we are
running fast cuz we're a little bit
behind here you can submit your
questions live in the twitch chat by
preface in your question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets you can also do the same on
spectrum which is our communication
platform available on Roberts space
industries comm if you're watching this
later on YouTube hello you can't
participate but you can watch alright so
as usual we put up a threat earlier in
the week we started collecting questions
for those who maybe couldn't be here and
a lot of the ones to be voted up by the
community through the through the course
of the year and right off the bat let's
start with their other questions come in
live since the introduction of
server-side object container streaming
desync has dramatically increased what
is causing this desync and what is the
fix so it wasn't it wasn't socks that
caused it there was a physics issue and
in fact I had there was a physics proxy
refactor that was done and we had that
fix ready for like three eight two
however the code base between three
eight and three nine had changed so much
so we deemed it too risky to actually
check it in so we checked it in two
three nine it's in three nine ideally we
think that fixed the root of the problem
and then if we run into any kind of edge
based issues we'll go in and fix those
case-by-case but ideally most of that
has been you know resolved for that now
obviously there's other factors that
play into that whether that be servers
flag or or even we kind of have some
internal lag built in
so and we're trying to work those issues
out right now to reduce as much latency
as possible we know that it's there it
is a focus of ours because it is a huge
quality of life issue that needs to be
resolved we've talked about the physics
we factor a couple times on this show
actually throughout the last quarter
it's important to remember remember that
well object suicide object in your
streaming was a big tent pole feature of
3.8 it was not the only feature that
went in so it can often when you see
issues like that it's often easy to go
oh that was the biggest one that must be
it but in this case it was the physics
per factor okay the number two question
is is the ship-to-ship spawning making
it into three point nine first answer no
so basically it's it's on our radar and
if I remember correctly I believe we are
working on it in some factor but it's
not going to make it into three nine
yeah and for anyone that maybe doesn't
know what that is it's the ability to
just spawn your ship with its parasite
craft within it if it's the carrick it's
the Pisces and the earth stuff like that
we we want it as much as you guys do I
can promise you that I've heard Chris
bring it up a number of times in the
various review meetings stuff like that
it's just as with all things priorities
are you aware of the ship duplication
but from the live chat yeah we've I mean
we've had a couple of factors that we've
been dealing with
obviously we're we really saw it on
three I think three eight one is kind of
working we're reared its ugly head and
then from there we tried to do some hot
fixes for it so if it's raring it's ugly
head again then then send those send
those things in and and we'll we'll get
it fixed I mean because the it should be
a it should just be a hot fix versus
having to roll out a whole new patch and
of course when he says send it in we're
referring to
issue council which is just saying on
Roberts page calm where you can submit
your own buck reports in much the same
way our QA team does and then you can
verify the bug reports that have been
submitted by other backers and help us
find these things and track these things
down even faster because again as we've
discussed several times the same
resultant bug can be caused by a
multitude of underlying features so just
because you see you see it submitted
already doesn't necessarily mean you
shouldn't submit yours because your it
may be happening for you for one reason
and it happened for that person for
another reason and the more reports we
get in the more you can verify them the
more it allows us to track down the
multiple underlying causes of these
things though or gives us another repro
case yes actually
get to it I was trying to think of the
Starship Troopers thing I'm doing my
part yeah that's what allows you
congratulations
hey hey it's always a good thing when
you think of Starship Troopers like it's
never a bad time I think of Starship
Troopers true true okay next question
have there been any major improvements
to server-side OCS I so fully understand
you're not a programmer an engine no no
and in fact I talked to Rob Johnson our
lead programmer in UK about this and not
player facing now there's been a lot of
work done that's it's on basically how
we edit into how we work on things think
of it as you work on a file you export
it and then now you have no see now a
lot of times let's say a space station
is made up of multiple low C's you know
planets made up of multiple OCS now what
we've been doing is trying to allow the
designers and the artists to go in to
high-level OSI crack it open and then be
able to edit and adjust things and so it
increases the workflow versus having to
okay I have my big OC that has
everything and then I go to one of those
smaller OCS and open up a different
editor window and then basically just
keep on stacking editor windows open
until I find the one that I want so this
is a way for us to kind of
crack things open and almost like
Russian doll it down to what we need to
do to fix it and then so we're working
on things that's increase our workflow
and increase our iteration time yeah
definitely one of the it's is see this
week we showcase the the the particle
layer separation tool that was made for
VFX it's it's oftentimes it's just as
important to be developing internal
facing tools and and and and tools
basically I was looking for in other
words it meant tools to help us track
these things down and and isolate where
the issues are like with the Russian
nesting doll thing you were talking
about yeah I mean the equivalents like
if if something takes you know 20 30
minutes to to check on and see if you
got it right and like you can only do
that so many times in today but
obviously if we can get that down to a
minute to check on it then you're gonna
be able to get more iterations on it
make sure it's right and then you know
basically move on to the next task
so we we want to tighten that loop as
much as possible okay the next couple
questions are all will this be in three
point nine hey it's all about alpha
three point nine will player 2 player
direct cash transfers being three point
nine this is a major pain point for any
group play at the moment it is no it's
not sorry it is it is a pain point we
know that it's it's not going to be in
three nine basically we know that we
need to refactor the moby glass and
actually get it into building blocks and
then that allows us to scale so from my
standpoint that is one of my highest
priorities and I can kind of lay you out
the the highest priorities from a UI
standpoint so we on our EU vehicle
future team we actually have people that
are working on the ship HUD and
basically moving towards you know what
we need to do and and you start seeing
elements of it being moved out or being
not moved out but being you know pushed
out with each release so
basically the the the center part of the
screen versus you know the upper corner
or the MF T's you know like we kind of
just work through each section and it's
the same thing with the player visor so
basically right now we have the bottom
left hand corner which is the actor
status and then from there we'll be
doing the mini-map and we'll be doing
the weapons section and we'll be doing
you know mission notifications and
training and tutorials so so basically
we've got the EU vehicle feature team
part of that team working on the ships
and then we've got part of the actor
feature team working on the visor as
well as some of the UI feature team to
kind of balance between the visor if
they need help on those and then the
next thing would be the the mobi glass
and we've touched on this before it's
you don't want to you try to we try to
minimize temporary work as much as
possible the mobi glass right now is
made entirely out of flash and we want
to convert it to there are new building
blocks tech which we first discussed on
how I see a couple quarters ago if we
built the technology into it now if we
if we did the transfers now we'd have to
redo it later because we'd be drilling
in for flash we have to redo it for
building blocks so it's one of those
it's rather than spend our time doing
work that we know a lot to throw away in
the near-term future where it just has
to wait and submit again it's a matter
of priorities but we're exactly very
aware we're very we actually were
actually doing an internal play test
here with just with the video team last
week and and one of us had a lot of
money and the other none of us know the
other ones did and it was very very good
so the big thing from us I think with
the mobi glasses is basically getting
that home screen done right and then
from the home screen then it will become
basically which prioritize apps now s42
is some some apps that they need and
then obviously PU has the existing ones
that we have as well as you know other
ones that we've thought about you know
the transfer
even how are we gonna clean up you know
the journals and the logs and you know
so that it's easier to use and track and
obviously the contract manager really
needs to be cleaned up as well so like
there's there's other thing there's
other apps but as soon as we get the the
home screen then we'll be building in
templates to actually get the other
stuff as well there's a question from
the live chat about once mobile glass is
rebuilt in building blocks can we have
an app to remote remote start our ships
people want to be able to just turn on
the lights and unlocked it I I mean I I
would prefer that just be on the player
it's almost like you know cars nowadays
if you if you have a you know just a
remote starter like I would rather you
know we do it that way where you set up
something on your ship you know and as a
remote start and then it just gets you
get close and it unfolds opens up and I
get aggregated I can already like just
like a proximity is like a proximity
alert yeah I would prefer it to be that
way so okay so I don't think it needs to
necessarily be mobi glass with
physicalized
inventory make it into 3.9 no that's
waiting for eye Kosh basically we have
the what we call internally the piss pit
system it's a wonderful name I know it's
the personal inner thought aspect and
being able to you know pull things off
and and adjust the the way your hotkeys
are working and and you know kind of
what inventory you have on your person
that at that time so but as far as
physical inventory and ends because
right now everything's global uh
switching over to physical inventory we
need to wait for I cache to come in
first and if you're more conversation
about what I cache is and how it works
we talked about it a bit at citizencon
and then again in either the one of the
last two pillar talks they start to the
blurred
together but um lots of stuff to know
about I cache there I think I think that
was in the first pillar Tomica well your
first peg which would have been the
third pillar talk episode yeah yep
there's we make a lot of videos well
pirates be able to sell cargo from
stolen ships in three-point-nine yes
well actually from stolen ships or
blown-up ships from blown-up ships yes
from stolen ships would have to check in
on that I don't my gut feeling is no
right now it's not working basically if
somebody's taking notes then send me a
note to check up on that okay a unified
friends list is coming we saw our first
look at that and I see earlier this
quarter is there more grouping and
Friends work is there more
yeah planned yeah the wording was a
little weird there yeah I mean this will
be our first iteration on it and then
from there I I definitely think that
there's there'll be more things planned
you know it's um I mean right now I
think this is a pretty good what we
would consider tier 0 you know a a
minimal Viable Product for for it the
one going in not the one that we have
right now so you know from there I'm
sure there will be some some UI issues
or maybe some back-end services or you
know some stuff on spectrum that we'll
need to clean up but I think this one's
been thought about you know from a
player standpoint this is moving forward
well it is cool in the in the test I
mean it's a simple thing but in the test
we can bring spectrum up on one screen
the game client up on the screen you can
add a friend and it immediately pops up
on one and do the same in the vice versa
and stuff like that so yeah so it's a
it's an important first step it's clean
yeah it's cleaning up a lot of the
issues that we had I mean the the friend
stuff before wasn't very intuitive and
then even on the back end there was
almost like four different lists you
know
that had to keep track of now it's one
unified list and so there's been a lot
of work you know from a technology
standpoint to to go in and make this
work again working on a the website as
well as working on the clients so it's I
think it's a big improvement yeah it's
not the it's not a flashy feature like
like like a new planet or a new but it's
so important to a online game multiple
online multiplayer game to have to make
the process of finding friends and
playing with your friends is easy and
efficient as possible will we see an
increase in player server capacity 43.9
yeah right now like I think we talked
about it last time like the server frame
rate is still isn't running the way that
we want it to run we have some some code
fixes in there the it's it's not a death
by a thousand cuts but it's basically
there are there's no silver bullet you
know for it right now so we're going
through and and this is another thing
that was talking to rob about is
basically kind of what the plans are to
hit this hard and we have some code
that's coming in that we feel will allow
us to evaluate those things better and
basically kind of see see the outlier
and see you you know if we're getting
installed on any thread and then figure
out how we can work that out and reduce
that stall
so obviously that will have impact on
the server and then you know ideally get
the server frame rate up first before we
start adding new new people in we run
into a gamut of food related questions
next we will be able to buy food at the
various food courts and many landing
zones in the game and drink at the bar
in three-point-nine yes so I mean the
bartender this stuff is going in right
now so but yes so you'll be able to to
buy it from vending machines
as well as I think there's the pizza
brokers and stuff like that so I'm sorry
yeah so basically right now the the bar
like we're we're just making sure
everything is is copacetic and it works
on the like the the feature work has
been done now there there were some
issues that we just wanted to see and
kind of make sure everything's good and
you know running in situation as well as
running it with internally what we call
services which is basically mimicking
you know the online state and sometimes
there's been disparity between what you
see in kind of like an editor versus on
the server so it's just making sure that
there's no disparity and everything's
good and then it should just go in you
mentioned very machines the next
question is actually yeah and actually I
think that I miss voted myself so I'm
not misquote it I've said something
wrong vending machines will not work
been eating so it's something that we're
working on and basically just didn't
make it so there's there's us thinking
about you know obviously the big Benny
version but it's there's a holistic
approach that we want to we want to make
sure that it works and basically acts
like a vending machine and we didn't get
that working for three nine so at the
food courts and at the bar yes you can
get food and drink and then but not at
vending machines okay you know as
hopefully it's the last food-related
question are we going to be able to
store food in the ship's kitchen area
not for three nine however you can store
packaged foods on your person same with
drinks and then you can use it that way
but you can't do it for I guess
theoretically you could buy a bunch of
stuff and just kind of place it in there
but it's not like some of these filling
the fridge for you kind of thing
hundreds of people voted that question
the people really want their
kitchenettes we've we've talked for a
while about the the the HUD rework you
mentioned it a little bit earlier in the
different pieces how much of the head
rework will we see in three-point-nine I
you'll see the visor obviously the
center of the screen in on the ships
that's been reworked and is with
building blocks now and then there's
other hot elements like you know certain
kiosks and other things have been moved
over from flash to building blocks the
group system you know so so there's
there's elements like on the FPS visors
so if you kind of break it down into
different screens so I'm gonna look at
the monitor real quick basically you've
got your your bottom left-hand side
that's building blocks everything else
right now is flash and then we're kind
of working our way through the quadrants
you know to switch everything over and
it's the same same thing that we're
doing with ships yeah so it's not going
to be a it's not gonna be like a rip the
band-aid off and one day you come and
there's a brand new top-to-bottom fully
different yeah yeah we're doing in
patches so and we're doing in pieces so
you know if if we could get all four
done you know in that time fantastic but
right now we've got the bottom left hand
side screen and then obviously the
center for the ships and and from there
it's just it's it's just a process of
just switching everything over I thought
we were done with food but if you buy a
granola bar and it's wrapped does your
character eat the wrapper or unwrap it
it actually unwraps as a chris roberts
game there's no way let us just eat the
wrapper correct no and we say we saw it
three days ago i saw somebody
unwrap it and then basically take three
bites and then and then and chris got
very excited about
that was on Tuesday I remember yeah no
so Tuesday I won't say the next part um
is there still a small team working on
quality of life bug fixes the game keeps
getting new stuff but there are still
loads of persistent bugs that make
playing what we have frustrating I it's
actually company-wide so it's not one
small team it's company-wide that that
we we work towards the you know fixing
this stuff so internally we have issues
that's let's say QA bring up or issue
council or other you know factors you
know somebody playing the game just
doesn't like it we have in JIRA we have
a label called QA GP review which
basically just means QA gameplay review
which then comes directly to me I triage
its and then I add what we would
consider a gameplay experience label on
it and so out of you know our our bucket
list of or out of our bucket of bugs we
have what we consider gameplay
experience bugs and any of those
gameplay experience bugs have directly
to do with quality of life so when we're
actually doing bug fixing and release
supports you know throughout the second
half of the quarter those quality of
life or basically the gameplay
experience bugs get risen up to the top
and get resolved now because in the past
what was happening was we were actually
building up a lot of bugs meaning we
would get and we have bugs broken down
into five different categories critical
basically blockers criticals highs
moderates and trivial now a lot of the
polish stuff and a lot of things that
you know kind of just are affect the
quality of life you know are really
highs moderates and trivial so any of
the blockers or criticals basically got
resolved but then that left a lot of
high moderates and trivial x' so this is
our way of saying no I view this is very
important and so team you need to work
on this and it's something that's
throughout the
quarter I'm always chasing down trying
to make sure that the feature teams as
well as the constant teams you know have
very clear focuses on all rights you
know for the ships like I want to make
sure that we're going through and we're
hitting a manufacturer really hard and
it's going through and squashing as many
bucks as we possibly can for that four
locations then it'll be location by
location obviously for feature teams on
it I just want to make sure that they're
going through all of their features and
making sure that we have a small amounts
of issues on them so then you know
because we are a live product and we
need to have it running not only for the
PU but also for s42
these quality of life issues also
affects you know us when we're
developing the game as well that's gonna
had something but no you got it when you
go to eat or drink now he's feeding me
only food-related questions when you go
to eat or drink do you have to take your
helmet off first I remember this I think
right now no I think so but it might be
that yes you do because we have the
ability to block the players from from
doing certain actions I'm trying to
remember I can't remember the next
question is actually related to it it
says will we be getting a remove helmet
button with three nine no not for three
nine basically we have the ability to do
it and something that we were working on
we have it working with a few helmets
but obviously we have a dearth of
helmets in the in the game that we need
to go through and do and the the
constant team just haven't enough time
to do a pass on it so why would why
would it not affect what Mike would one
why would we why would a remove helmet
not just work for every helmet across
the board is it because
the animations because different sizes
of the helmets and basically and you
know when we actually take the helmet
off we're I think we're moving it to the
hip
you know and carrying it around so
there's there's a lot of there were some
just some things that we needed to
resolve and make sure that's you know
the bubble for the helmet and everything
like that worked it's something that
they're actively working on right now it
just won't be there for 3:9 because we
don't want it to just hit a button in
the helmet just disappears
correct okay we've heard very briefly
about volatile or perishable cargo it
was mentioned in the rodent roundup
we've mentioned it on SEO a couple times
what is it so what we have working right
now for vaults of cargo is based off of
the prospector and the mole is so when
you're when you're mining and then let's
say your ship gets JA sold or or based
off of the what you mind you know
there's a time associated with it it
will basically become volatile and so it
can destroy your ship or for you to have
to jettison it so we have it working for
the prospector in the mall because the
way that the prospector mole is kind of
they have their own internal cargo grids
so I don't want people thinking that's
it will work with the cargo that you
carry around by hand right now so that's
kind of the next step that we want to do
but and we need I cash first before we
do that then we can do it before the
hands and and you know for the other
cargo boxes but for 3:9 when you're
mining it's you'll we've added a button
on the dashboard so basically when
you're flying around it will start
blinking you know and then when it
becomes too hot you know or or basically
two jaw
then it will it'll blow up and so you
need to jettison it before before it
does it try anything of why do you want
cargo to explode my ship to blow up well
it's it's what we want to be able to do
is is have different things different
types of cargo so you know for example
maybe you've got a do data or you know
and and with the data it's encrypted
somehow or maybe it will you know almost
like Mission Impossible itself and start
smoking or in the case that we have
quantanium you know that's supposed to
be a volatile fuel but again it's risk
reward I mean that's really what it
comes down to is we want to if we just
want the player to have that those kind
of you know if you want to go for this
then it's it's high money but it's gonna
be high risk as well quantanium it's
quite a dilemma
from the live chat lots of tests were
run last night after the idris battle
was shown in ISE utilizing an EMP is
currently balanced will likely make the
idris an easy dinner does the design
team know this we want to challenge i
design team does notice basically we're
still we're still going through and ends
trying to play it right now right now we
have a crash where the QA department
will be able to get up to the idris
mission or the idris aspect and then
that crashes the game so we haven't been
able to do a lot of internal cycles on
it yet simple but i can guarantee you
that those those balance issues are
going to come up internally and then
obviously once we release it out to you
you then it will it will definitely come
up that way
yeah I'm aware I'm aware of the ages but
we almost had a we almost had this Simon
go out yesterday with no footage
whatsoever
because we we kept crashing every time
so happens there's work and they don't
work and they work again and we were on
we were on that down slope like up until
late Wednesday so yeah yeah we're still
having issues with it and the meeting
and I got out of just right right before
this and we're stopping issues with it
so let's see how is PvP bounty hunting
going to be different in 3.9 I don't
think it is and I think they're
referring to there's there's a card on
the public road map about about a PvP
bounty and improvements I yeah I think
it refers to the the st. like the synced
assassination missions it's like that
there's new there's new well those are
PvE though I don't know what it means
for PvP I mean I mean the improvements
are it's not a big sweeping change like
we'd bow knee the way that we want it to
go like there's an there's a fair amount
of work there you know to because right
now you don't hunt you know there's
there's you just show up to a place and
it's like okay they're there they are
like there's no hunting like I'm I want
to I want to feel like you know the
Mandalorian or Bubba felt like I want to
go hunting you know he said affecting my
presence if I the card I think says its
it's like the allows players to to hunt
other players with bounties on their
heads like so it's like you can still
hunt when you have a bounty on their
right I'm not sure we don't look at I
made a note here I'm going to follow up
afterwards and we'll see if we can't get
some information on that will the
temperature be different on day or night
side of the moons and planets and how
will temperature change when spaceship
doors are open if the environmental and
spaceships temperatures are very
different okay so first things first
right now it will not be different
that's something that we're working on
regarding the time of day change the
other aspects will be based off the room
system so when the spaceship it opens
assuming there's not a bulkhead or
airlock associated with it then it will
be vented and it will take on the larger
you know the larger room which is
basically the planet and so therefore
your temperature will drop instantly but
those are being worked on now so they're
not in three nine just as a file because
we've got a message somebody's looking
up the PvP stuff just remember that
there's a lot of people that work on the
public road map everybody not just Todd
something that so - not everybody can
know everything about every idea know it
again we've got three major pillar
directors you know or I don't want sig
major we have three pillar directors to
have multiple teams underneath them Tony
Shan myself you know and then from there
there's you know Ian Scott's you know
locations nick has us 42 like there's so
much going on in this game that Hardin
sometimes it's it's hard to keep
everything you know sorry in in the head
we got people on Himmel so we'll see
what it is will it be possible to repair
refuel or restock ships that are
currently stored the pad based system
has been fairly unreliable as far back
as 3.0 it'll still be pad based for
right now like eventually that's the
goal the goal is you know for you to
land and there to be a technician there
and then you say okay I want these
things done and then you go and do
whatever you need to do and and that's
that gets fixed in the backgrounds right
now we know the issues that are
happening you know obviously with
al-azhar and even with some of our other
locations regarding landing so these it
won't be store yet but it will
it won't work yet
I mean that's that's what it comes down
to a new Babbage clothing looked great
but it feels like new baby ins would be
wearing Hawaiian shirts too starkly
contrasts the weather outside they saw
Wally's bar yesterday I see not a
question just food for thought well
you're gonna see more of new Babich next
week on ISC
Wally's Bar is just one particularly
themed area don't
it's amazing don't get me wrong but it
is not what all of new Babich looks like
looks like yeah but uh imagining this
probably came from tyler witkin since it
was a Hawaiian shirt thing I just
assumed everyone in shirt related thing
comes from since they continuously come
are the player interaction system
improvements on the roadmap significant
or just minor updates and we're gonna
when we're putting where we've got a
segment in development privacy they're
gonna see that we're gonna find out a
lot more about what the I won't say what
piss pit yeah I just said I wouldn't say
that night said it sorry I blinked out
for a second um how significant would
you say the player interaction system
improvements are significant I mean
we're changing so it it really is just
the managing of stuff and ends the the
goal is to basically get rid of the P
the PMA you know so the ideas the player
can go in select the weapons select kind
of hotkeys associated with those weapons
and do all of that in the player
interaction system and go through and
and you know I feel it's it's a game
changer
just because of because the the time
that you spend going back and forth
between the VMA and ourside the PMA and
ends before like I think this is a good
very very good change and we've got
three more episodes of I see this
quarter it's not it's not the next
episode but it's one of the two after
that well you'll get to see how about
the player interactions
and the it's like that you know it let
me I just it's really cool-looking it's
really impressive if I if I'm allowed to
have an opinion and I thought oh yeah
it's a I'm I'm I've been very happy with
it and I think the team has done a great
job will consuming food or water take
time or will it be an instant action
like using a med pin it's okay so
consuming takes as long as the animation
does now what we've talked about in the
past right now a burger would be eaten
in one bite
obviously we know that's not the case in
the future the idea would be that you
take three or four bites out of it and
then it's consumed now the one of the
things that we do have is it depends on
the size of the burger so one of the
things that we do have right now is the
food I basically has kind of a
consumption over time
sorry absorption over time it's the same
thing with all go with drinks so
basically there's a certain time that it
takes to break down and and kind of move
through your your system now the what
you'll see is is basically you've been
sustained and it takes you up to that
level and kind of resets the clock and
then you know as it's as it's being
absorbed you know that that bar is still
it hasn't been reset and started
counting down it just stays there until
the absorption has stopped then the bar
starts counting down if I remember
correctly it's hard we Chris has been
known to say for a while you take things
to the point of realism then you bring
them back to the point of fun it's it's
the conversation is now is about how off
how long it should take to eat a burger
and it's like you know we can go for
that fidelity where you're forced to
stop gameplay for a good five minutes
while you eat a burger but that might
not be the most fun experience so Curtis
thank you take it to the point of
realism
you bring it back you're going to fun
let's see can you tell us more about the
surrender mechanic that was mentioned in
an IC segment earlier the ability to
there was the the prison system instead
of instead of being forced to be killed
you can now surrender actually I don't
have very many eyes on this one so my my
gut feeling is right now I think it's I
almost think it's out right now until we
do a little bit more improvement on the
prison system because I think I think
you just do get shot and you will get
you know you'll only go to prison as
long as it's basically a security force
that's that's killing you so and then
once that security forces killed you
then you know and then you're stuck in
prison for X amount of time buts the
surrender mechanic as far as I know I
don't remember seeing it working with
the prison system just you know but I
could be wrong on that one since it's
not under my pillar let's see we've got
well radiation hazards be a part of the
upcoming actor status system it will be
it but not four three nine for the for
the radiation there's I think that's
part of like version one or version to
what we consider actor status but it's
basically we just need a little bit more
time on that one and we're building it
or we're building it up and making sure
that's it's not only radiation but it's
other you know hazards hazards that's
will affect you whether that be fire or
you know smoke or anything else that
could happen you know either on your
ship or you know strange planet weapon
attachment you eyes aren't some it's I
don't think they're currently on the
roadmap but they are coming in three
point nine we're gonna see it on ISC
soon with the interaction system and
then that same segment
but do you want to give folks an early
description of what players can expect
for the weapon attachment UI yeah I mean
basically we've got just certain
attachments that you can add and it'll
just bring up the weapon in front of
your face and then at that point in time
you can choose alright do I change outs
you know the sights or do I add
something on the barrel or or under
barrel or you know so it really is just
kind of we want to make sure that we're
showing off the weapon
as well as you know the player gets that
tactile experience of switching out yeah
it's when I was talking about when it
looked whoo I realized that I was
actually talking about the weapon
attachment you I think not tha this that
doesn't look cool with the radio and
stuff like that but pulling up the
weapon and then watching where the
attachments would go and in swapping out
is really cool it's I don't know it's
just I sometimes I get to be a fan and I
think this is cool there's a reason for
the end of that is receiving money the
end of the quarter because I think it's
really cool yeah well in I think the
weapon team has done a fantastic job
over the years building in a lot of
detail and a lot of things that you know
the player a lot of times just won't
experience when when it's only on you
know kind of this side of the screen but
obviously now you can actually look at
it and you can really inspect it and I
mean you can inspect it in stores before
but now you can actually show it off or
you know do it outside of stores what
about showers and toilets at some point
the digested food has to come out again
it did bent did bender s this one I
don't know but it got over a hundred
votes so it made it made the thread you
might you might have voted on that one
this I it's not for thirty-nine we know
that we know we have to do it it's
something that we've talked about with
the actor status and it's built into the
actor status I'll still push for like
red outs you know if you're too
constipated or something like that then
you know or blackouts if you're if you
smell bad from not taking a shower cause
I think so
or other players blackout kind of thing
so poor hygiene becomes chemical
weaponry yeah basically send your
letters to todd papy care Frankfurt
let's see trading in three eight two is
difficult because stations don't offer
enough for character caterpillar players
we miss we miss big high-risk trading
routes since the few patches
please give trading a little love that's
not a question oh just requested I guess
yeah I mean we can go in and evaluate it
all again whoever sticky notes for this
meeting then I'll speak to its data guys
and in in austen about it okay
let's see why was prison gameplay
prioritized over other missing game
mechanics I basically to actually make
piracy more legit
you know because right now if you if you
look at piracy mission rewards versus
kind of good behavior mission rewards
like in there was no no disincentive to
you know to not do you know not be a
good boy or a good girl kind of thing so
this is a way for us to to really kind
of focus on that and really show that
there is a separation between right and
wrong and then obviously this feeds into
other careers you know like bounty
hunting
piracy saboteur smuggling and so and so
forth so like this is a way for us to to
kind of really start enforcing right and
wrong in in the system yeah we talked to
we talked a bit with the press in the
team when we did the segment earlier
this this quarter and it's it's also
prisons seems like
it's a punishment seems like it's a bad
thing for for the the bat the bad
players but what it is is it's it's
actually you have to have the risk
before we can provide greater rewards
it's I mean there's a way to look at
prisons where we at we when we once we
add the risk we have to have the risk of
that week we can then create greater
rewards for the court for that lifestyle
so it's it's actually one of those net
positive things for the people that want
to play on the well and I guess the if
if you look at it like this does help
like I said anything that really had
kind of is on two sides of law whether
that be a law enforcement law
enforcement bounty hunting assassination
you know piracy like it it helps those
career paths so now you know the end
there's gameplay associated with it
there so it's not just you know like
other games okay you go to jail you pay
the fine and instantly respond and and
now you don't have you know anybody
looking after you like there's there's
time associated with that and then from
there that creates new unique gameplay
of you know do I want to try to do I
want to try to break out of jail and do
I want to or do I want to serve my time
so that's kind of the way that we're
we're thinking about it and that we've
we view this as a foundational elements
in order to actually build upon you know
build those careers upon and I think
there's also a big a big drive for for
something like a jump town 2.0 I like I
can another big high-risk high-reward
PvP area like that well that's actually
it I got a we I have to let you go
you've got another meeting that you've
got that I got to be able to get you to
the last question we have is will there
be any mining missions as soon as I said
like collect five tons of copper so like
that about missions specifically for
mining as as the prospector is out and
the ball is out and more personal mind
tools are out yeah
no I mean the the thing is that's with
the money missions obviously we've got
particularly that we need to you know
build missions for but right now I think
the way that Tony and CRC mining is
career you know in missions is a little
bit different than what I see mining
missions and so like we need to get on
the same page first before we actually
implement it and so I want to be able to
sit there and talk about it with them
and and explore the pros and cons of
each and then we go from there all right
that's it I know you gotta get to kick
off me
so Todd thank you so much for taking the
time to be here with this closure on
Friday
