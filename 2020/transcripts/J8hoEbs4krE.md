or than other manufacturers and races
the vanduul ships are really material
driven over the time we've been working
on this game the vanduul race and bundle
ships art style changed a few times we
believe we found something really good
and interesting that really spoke to
everyone on a team who is the kingship
interior rework and we decided last year
to apply that style and those visuals to
the rest of the bundle fleet by creating
them that no material library we started
looking into types of surface and
large-scale panel textures we often
create a test room to bring all in the
materials and look at them in certain
light conditions and we put it on simple
geometry like spheres and cylinders and
to have parallax occlusion mapping
visible and see how it deforms on a
material and this was a very helpful way
to look at the materials before we
applied on ships so if you think about
any creepy-crawlies any deep-sea
creatures any kind of slimy horror risk
stuff that's kind of what we're going
for in our references and that's what
kind of all started was again Frank's
kingship interior he used that a lot and
it just all all started from there
looking at the blade blade is a light
fighter of the bundle fleet so obviously
making it look sleek and and nimble and
lightly armored was was the big
objective on this ship
the main difference really between the
squadron blade and the blade you know is
the cockpit area some of you might know
that the vanduul the way they sit in a
cockpit is sort of like we sit on the
bikes this is kinda where this build of
tray look of the ship comes into play
which naturally if you're looking mostly
down and forward the way you want to
approach your tray is from above so
that's why the ship has the most armor
on the areas where like on the top of
the ship where pilot doesn't look and
it's lightly armored at the bottom where
he is kind of heading and he doesn't
have to worry about this is probably
what defined our style of all the Vandal
ships that if you if you look closely
you will see it's this little situation
nice hard shell at the top soft busy
high frequency areas on the bottom and
the cockpit that looks not like a human
technology at all so if it comes to
vandal weapons the one to create their
weapons
sort of like the rest of their
technology which is discovering what
they can from battlefields and from
other races however else they can find
the components they need one of the
issues on old scythe was the two weapons
were part of the shape this is something
we wanted to definitely resolve on a new
one
visual aspects of the shape is we did
like asymmetry a lot that definitely has
to stay it's fairly iconic but we wanted
to make sure the ship looks much more
balanced than it was before and we also
wanted to give it those medium fighter
characteristics which is it has armor
plating looks a little bit slower than
the faster nimble ships but it
definitely looks like it can do better
maneuvers than a heavier ship for the
reef bundle and and other races if it
comes to clave we wanted to use this
opportunity to give it a unique look so
it doesn't look like a scythe with an
extra wing on the other side also wanted
to make it look special so it looks
similar to other ships but in its own
right fairly unique we like the bird of
kind of prey aggressive silhouette and
look we kinda wanted to emphasize on
that a little bit more which also suited
the art style of vandal especially when
looking at other ships the smaller
bundles ships definitely have this bird
of tray kind of look to them
this is a bit of a peek into what we've
created for a bundle for squadron 42
which was a very exciting task for me
and working with Frank on developing
this and with Nate our director that was
incredibly rewarding and I hope you like
what we came up with and universe the
ships of the vanduul are just some of
the ways we've been celebrating alien
week all week from contests to language
primers from recipes to historical fun
facts to roundtable q and A's and more
be sure that you've checked out the
website to see everything that's
happened this week as for your weekly
dose of currently in development updates
it's time once again for sprint report
let's start things off with some combat
AI improvements that are underway what
you're seeing here is a new reload test
using current behaviors available in the
game now players don't have unlimited
ammo so why should NBC's the set up here
is that this NPC starts with a limited
amount of clips and then automatically
reloads as they empty each one but
eventually we'll have individual
behaviors here that will distinguish
between the various NPC characters but
also never mind the invulnerability here
they turn that on special for me because
I'm as one designer put it not good now
when they run out of clips the NPC will
then query the area for an ammo usable
and then move to refilled before
returning back to combat behavior it's a
little thing but when combined with the
dozens of other small touches like this
these behaviors should lead to a more
immersive and ultimately more rewarding
gameplay experience for squadron 42 in
the persistent universe of life
in ship news eagle-eyed citizens may
have spotted the origin 100 series being
added to the public roadmap for alpha
311 so here's a look at the current gray
box process now rain box is the
intermediate phase between white box and
final art where the initial geometry is
created structure is formed and we get
the first real sense of shape language
for the ship or vehicle now once it's
all validated here the ship will move on
to final art where the texture and
detail are added and its true
personality will begin to shine through
of course it's not just new ships that
are on the way though old stalwarts like
the Gladius opt in a testbed for new
features and functionality is currently
having a little work done including the
addition of a weapon and item rack to
help with missions in squadron 42 as
well as a dash makeover complete with
working toggle switches and lights to
support the upcoming cockpit
interactions functionality
now while the weapons rack should make
its way to players in the upcoming Alpha
310 we're going to be learning more
about the new cockpit interactions
featured next quarter so keep an eye out
for that over this quarter we've been
following along with the early
development of our upcoming and refinery
debts and we're here now with another
look at current white box gray box
looked up the refinery decks are meant
to occupy a separate space within the
rest stops from the more commercial
areas these are where players come to
handle their more industrial needs from
refining mined materials to picking up
mining related missions or even buying
new mining equipment one of the larger
elements of these locations are the
blazing heat generated from the open
smelting facilities and blazing slag
being poured into vats
[Music]
refinery decks are intended to be
utterly industrial from the large metal
clinging to the shouts of the workers
all around and if that's not hot enough
for you on our last sprint report we
showcased the early explorations of fire
propagation tests for star citizen and
squadron 42 and we're back with another
update now after starting with voxels
the VFX team is now laying the
groundwork for a functional entity based
prototype that can track things like
temperature fuel amount fire and smoke
intensity per entity and incorporate
those into systemic propagation what
you're seeing here now is a fire volume
that starts at the ignition point and
grows from there using entities that
allow for mesh spawning which will then
in turn allow fire and smoke particles
to spawn directly from the surface of an
item's geometry the team's next step is
allowing propagation from voxels to
entities and vice-versa but honestly
it's still this kind of looks like a
pyromaniacs paradise to me
speaking of pyromaniacs and what might
be the best or worst segue i've made all
season it's time for another look at
early work on the planets of the pyro
system in this case pyro - now in the
original galactic guide for the pyro
system pyro - was said to be a cordless
planet that once held significant
mineral deposits and became the victim
of a of a metal rush that quickly picked
the planet clean leaving a little more
than an empty husk and well we may have
to revisit that assessment before all is
said and done similar to our I've looked
at pyro one last month this is early
work on the planet's surface alone so
you can expect plenty of changes and
improvements along the way before it
gets plopped into the pyro system with
its family of other planets but it's fun
to showcase what planet tech v4 can cook
up in a new worlds very early days
so what'd we learn about this week well
we learned that the vanduul and their
ships get more alien and more menacing
as development progresses that the
Gladius remains testbed for the coolest
new features and that between refineries
fire propagation and the pyro system
star citizen's development really seems
to be heating up and I have no shame a
free side star citizen I'm Jared Huckaby
we'll see you next week
