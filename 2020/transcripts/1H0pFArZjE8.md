so in star citizen there's a lot of cool
places to visit
but traveling between those places in
space and such
uh maybe it gets a little bit flat and
boring uh and maybe that's what it's
like
in real life but we want to make a
really really cool experience here and i
think we can make it look a lot nicer
through space gaming
so this is a child gas cloud this one
spawns with some asteroids and this is
basically
one of the ways we're going to add depth
to different locations in stanton
the way these are created are through a
process in houdini that i've been using
and basically i can just try and make a
simulation
play around with it try and see what
looks nice
and then i'll try and bring it into
engine once it's an engine then i can
start lighting this guy up and
and creating some interesting areas all
around it
the reasons why there are some dark
areas and some lighter areas of this gas
cloud is because
it's gas particles right so the hotter
or
maybe more intense gas will light up a
little bit more
and the darker gas will just pretty much
give some shadows and uh
and occlusion around here
so the red stuff that you can probably
see here along the outskirts here
it's it's the new space dust and it's
pretty much being lit up by a light leak
color that comes
from the properties of the gas cloud
and so the sun will pierce light through
the cloud and then it'll tint it a
specific color
so that's what it's doing to the
particles right now as i'm moving
towards it
but we can see it a little bit more
obviously if we zoom into an asteroid
here
has this little bit of a red tint on it
because the gas cloud starts it's
generally a bluish color
light bluish but it has a lightly color
that is orange and so when the light
pierces through it
it gets more and more of that tint added
onto the objects around it
so this is one of the gas cloud childs
that we have right now
but if there's a child there must always
be a parent
so if we zoom out
and we'll speed up a lot here
[Music]
this is its parent and this guy is quite
massive
so it has several children within it so
i know where a second one is here
[Music]
so here's another child on the opposite
side of the cloud
it's a very similar scale to the one we
were just at
and it gives you a very similar amount
of depth and
feel but it's lit in a completely
different way maybe it looks a little
bit more aggressive and it
gives off a cool feel like that
so with play spaces generally you'll
spend most of your time
in these uh child vdbs um
and then you'll do your quantum
traveling or even
flying at sem speeds from one to another
but something like this would be a
quantum travel
to your other child or multiple other
children
and so i really wanted to at least test
here in this setup what i've got here
and see if quantum traveling through
this uh
really nice maybe angelic bright area
would be a would be an interesting feat
so throughout this i've been moving very
very fast
uh probably faster than what you can
quantum travel at
um so it is generally really hard to to
tell what scale we're at right now
but if i go down to this guy
this little child here and you can see
your asteroids
you can see the whole thing but maybe
what we can do is turn on some planets
for scale
so right here this is a sphere this
scale of yellow
so it's it's really it's really it's
it's very close
uh to the scale of a of a moon here this
child itself
but we can scale up a little bit here's
the size of hurston
slightly bigger not too bad
and here's the size of crusader and we
have that
compared to the parent the parent is
even larger than that
so i think there's a lot of space uh
that we can use
around here to add extra
extra little depth little children
even though that sounds funny to say
little child gas clouds all around
the parent here and it can hold them as
a home
as work continues adapting the gas cloud
tech created for squadron 42
to use throughout stanton and beyond the
actor feature team is busy adding
further iteration on features like
force reactions which not only aim to
provide a realistic and
visceral sense to being hit by just
about anything in the star citizen
universe
but also give reason to all those seats
in the bellies of drop ships
when exterior forces begin transferring
to those within
so force reactions at this time around
we're just adding a little more
layers to the the game it's going to
give you more immersion
i think it's if you're just adding to
what what star citizen is
so the big additions on on 311 is the
knockdown
and seeing the reactions in the ship
when you work on any feature you need
you need a good testing ground like
something
a little bit simpler where where there
isn't less noise than
say loading into the full pu experience
every time
but it also allows us to really dial in
on all the different edge cases
all the different scenarios with forced
reactions
we've got sam and sam's really sort of
taken the whole
test level to heart and build like an
amusement
park of different rights you can go on
to test
all the different force reactions
aspects and this is great because it
allows you know
allows you to have tons of fun first of
all and yeah if you have fun when you
make a feature
is gonna be a better feature
[Music]
hello i am samuel joyce i'm a technical
designer
on star citizen so let me jump into the
editor and show you what that's all
about
one of the force reactions that we're
working on is called twitch where the
player will be hit by a bullet and their
body will react in a certain way
depending on how far away they are being
shot
and how far they are depends on how
strongly the impact will be
so when you're being hit by a automatic
weapon
you'll really feel that impact similarly
if you're
you're being shot by a rifle the rifles
generate a lot more impact
which means you're going to get a much
more severe reaction
when you get hit by a shotgun from fire
away
you'll get spread you'll get peppered by
many pellets and the more pellets you
get hit by and the more of an impulse
that's generated
meaning your camera is going to shake
more however if you walk up to the
shotgun and get
shot point blank suddenly you get
knocked down
and now you have a chance to shoot your
enemy
when you're in the field battle you're
going to be shot by rockets of course
we've got god mode in this instance so
when you get by the rockets
you kind of like fly sideways so what
i'm going to do
next is set up the force directions to
always
play a knockdown whenever i'm shot by a
pistol so we see the
most accurate representation of being
blasted by a shotgun
what this big green square is for is for
testing our force reactions
so for example if i increase the force
to
about 60 we're going to get a really
small little nudge
which will knock us down and we'll
barely go anywhere
and if we up the force a bit more we
should start going about
one and a half meters forward so the
furthest that we want you to be able to
fall
when you have an explosion go off behind
you is about three meters so
this little yellow line helps us measure
that
one of the things we want to be wary of
when you're getting knocked down is when
you get knocked down from a great height
what's the character going to do is he's
falling the kinds of issues that we'd be
looking at would be just the general
animation flow
and being able to see if we get got
enough frames in each
little area where it looking clunky and
make sure it's smooth
[Applause]
as you saw there just as the explosion
went off my camera shaked a little bit
there's a little example of what
the grenade explosions pressure is going
to do to the
character if you're not quite in the
blast zone
so here's a grenade where i haven't been
able to get out the way for the effects
next up i'm going to show you ai
twitches
so once this guy knows
some of the reactions that you could see
i can trigger them myself
over here when he's being shot he'll be
hit by this thing
so we've just gone to the shipanga test
level where i can spawn in
any of the ships that i need to test in
so today we're gonna
look at the andromeda if i just
teleport to this seat
and then we go we can get that
what i'm going to get this to do now is
we're going to get the ai to fly my ship
for me
[Music]
and what we're going to see is we're
going to see some
your character is going to start leaning
depending on the g-forces of the ship
so right now we're flying directly
upwards what i'm going to do now is ask
a andromeda to ram the ship
sometimes um i feel sorry for these guys
we just keep knocking them off the
screen
all the time
to wrap up i would say this release is
gonna be one uh
big new push on the force reactions the
knockdowns for me
especially it's a it's a new feature
that that really adds
a different dimension to the game but
this is by
by no means the end of it we're going to
keep iterating on it we're going to keep
adding more
types of reactions balance it
and you know obviously this is where a
lot of player feedback is going to be
useful
you know hope you guys really enjoy what
we put out there
get your feedback back to us and and you
know trust us to
keep working on it and and getting it
dialed in where
everyone is really happy with it
so what we learned this week well we
learned that gas clouds can be used to
make some of the areas between points of
interest
more interesting themselves that it can
be just as much fun building test levels
for developers
as it is making game levels for players
and that when the captain turns on the
fasten seat belt light
you better move around the cabin at your
own risk
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you next week
you
