## Transcript

hi everybody welcome to another edition
of star citizen live game dev I'm your
host jared huckaby and if you've never
seen a star citizen live game dead
before it's where we take about an hour
out of our Friday the end of our week
and explore a little bit about the
process that one of our developers or
group of our developers do in the past
we've created characters we've created
creatures crotch spiders which we won't
talk about we've done spaceship concepts
today we are we are going where no game
that has gone before into the realm of
VFX and exploring some of the work that
our team is doing developing our gas
cloud tech for well first star citizen
and squadron 42 and joining me on the
show right now are two people that I was
gonna say need no introduction but I'm
pretty sure this is the first time
they've been on the show so I guess we
should do an introduction I always do an
introduction anyway Jacob and Oliver
from the VFX team hey guys doing good
things
so welcome to the show there's a first
time on the show
let's tell tell folks a little bit about
who you are and what you do for star
citizen we'll just start at the top and
go down so Jacob who are you what do you
do
yeah I'm Jacob I'm a VFX technical
artist working ci g4s wouldn t you and
what is it what is it technical VFX
artists do I guess I could confident say
that we mostly work within a program
called Houdini as its I guess it's what
we work in mesh at the time it's a bit
like 3ds Max and Maya but just a bit
different it's been more technical and a
bit more more suited for part artists
yeah it's been more of a simulation
based program which makes it great for
of gaming with BD bees and gas cloud and
how about you alright so I'm Oliver I'm
a devious visual effects technical
artist yeah as Jay said like we work on
like Houdini pipeline and we also
support the visual effects teams and
other teams around the company working
on the PU and squadron and like helping
them with the tools and the processes
and they're gonna go free that one of
those prizes in
today awesome so we folks who have been
following the project for a while know
that we started our gas Tec hourglass
gas cloud tech first start for squadron
42 developing a location called the coil
folks who have been following if saw
that first in the vertical slice that we
did a little while ago or a lot of while
ago and now we are looking we're
currently looking at ways toward to
bring that tech into the persistent
universe right now through another guys
are experimenting with the the Grange
points and stuff like that so why don't
you go ahead and start your screen share
I'll get rid of the cameras and you can
show us a little bit about what you've
been working on so yes so we showed la
citizencon the jump point and what we're
going to do today as I show you how
lights that jump point was created we
did it with in Houdini using the gas
cloud tech and we are going to talk
about the processes that we make with it
and also they're doing the parent and
child relationship and that is where we
have a large gas cloud for just say
doing the very light long distance far
away shots and then where we put a
smaller one in the middle where we get a
lot really close to where and we see
what the D cell and that's what we're
going to try and do within an hour today
then we get started let's go ahead and
move my little camera off the corner
here just looking at myself and slowly
here we go that way we can see their
work and you're gonna have to explain
what we're looking at right now this
doesn't look like a gas glad so in
Houdini we start with geometry and they
go work for has they evolved over quite
long quote with like everyone who's
worked on it is changed slightly one of
the things that Jake brought tude Gasca
workflow was how we use geometry and
that you do need to make big gas cars we
see the first thing is say we're going
to the kindest plate head is a classic
Houdini primitive scale it up for just
size so it fits in
well better and we're going to convert
it to this fog volume this is now can we
can export that to game and we can see
it here this as you can see is the pig
head as a volume but it's really bass
it's very solid it's it's quite nice how
we can see it really quickly but we want
to make it really nice and cool so we're
gonna just start by like we're seeing it
right now where it we don't actually
have any shadowing on it so if we put
the Sun shadows ayat we can now see that
we get some detail in here and we also
have like a very very simple light that
we have at the moment so whilst a really
great about this tech is that we can
offer like all these shapes that we want
and put them in and that's really
fantastic and there's something which we
haven't really they'd been able to do in
games before so let's go back into
convenience of making something yeah
just just for the folks that are in the
chat right now that the pig head is just
a standard a standard piece of test
geometry that's within Houdini yes yeah
all right is a bit of like a Houdini
tropes I had to show I'm sorry it's a
Houdini mean it's it's not something
that's going into star citizen before
before I see the reddit thread and then
I had to get that email from CR what do
you say we were putting in the game
today Jared it's good today that the
style of modeling to create this gas
card is there's so many different ways
of doing it this is just one of the ways
to do it and I think until we we plan to
do all of this I haven't actually seen
modeling gas clouds in this way using
using essentially layers you always see
the result of that quite quite soon yeah
so it's kind of interesting because what
I'm doing at the moment is I'm trying to
like create a polygon of the big forms
that we're going to use later on
and we're going to do this quite rough
to start and then maybe if we have more
time we're going to add in the detail
later on but at the moment we're just
like playing around with like the shapes
that we can get and make something quite
interesting to look at because we found
that sort of like the best things that
we can lay see that become flied through
by lady's very light abstract forms as
well and as it does they change from
location to location so like for
instance the the jump gate that we saw
had that record idea our never there
because they had this eye very magnetic
theme to it which had looked like our
wings so I someone brought up and then
we couldn't get away from there calling
it up and I sort of like based around
the lore of how like the jump points
work so like for each different thing
that we do
we're sort of going to be playing with
different methods of creating things you
know right off the bat we're dealing
with glass glass use gas clouds today
there's a space in in space like nebulae
and stuff like that what we're talking
with the tech that we're talking about
today isn't what's going to be used for
volumetric planetary clouds and it's not
what what folks can look forward to for
Crusader for instance was which is a gas
giant those are those are different
initiatives yeah and it's really
important to understand that there were
really different challenges as well
because like the thing with gas clouds
is that they can actually be bigger than
the planets and and then they also just
trying to light all clouds across the
planet is a completely different thing
yeah and it's a really interesting like
to have all these different technical
challenges that we're having to deal
with at the moment yeah so what we're
touring this today this week is gas
clouds in space nebula the likes likes
of that as far as atmospheric stuff
that's not what we're talking about
today it's not what we're shown today
this isn't the process for that and for
creating a gas giant planet like you say
der again
different initiative different tech so
that's so that's not what we're doing
here today just to set some expectations
early on in the show so yeah what you
started with a sit with a simple strip
and then you have just been mutilating
this yes this is one of the big
challenges when when it comes to
modeling the larger forms of the gas
cloud is you're trying to try to model
like essentially like an abstract shape
trying to model chaos in a sense because
you just want really random shapes big
forms and and wanting a quite tricky
because you're trying to create
randomness when instinctly as an artist
you're trying to create something with
with actual shape so this thing you're
doing in the lower-right in in the
engine we refer to something that looks
like this is like flow graph is this
this function similar to flow graph ish
also poly poly extrude you need to help
at the back thank you you said that was
gonna happen when we invited it's like
oh this just means I get to backseat
drivers work don't I so what's the
question so what are we doing what are
these steps that you're that you're
doing here on the lower right hand car
that transform the blast the mountain
the bend what do each one of these do
you don't necessarily need to hit each
one but yeah what's happening with these
so Houdini is a node-based program
unlike 3ds Max and Maya where you apply
a function to it since like the your
polygons and then you do an extrude to
create a cube for example Houdini works
in a similar sense but instead of
keeping things in a function and just
having code in the background so you
won't perform this action
Houdini actually has all of these in
node so it's totally non-destructive
so if Holly went all the way to the back
of his to the top of his network you
would start from your um you'll be able
to see the original grid that he created
from yeah so it's just totally
non-destructive and it's actually one of
the big benefits of Houdini is that
non-destructive workflow yeah yeah cuz
then you can start sampling data at
different points off of the network
which is actually what we need to do and
actually how is this the only way we can
overcome some of the technical hurdles
when we start dealing with things that's
complex the coil we need to know and and
extract data from our models at
different points of its creation so we
need to know maybe the size of our
feature and then as before and after
you've performed an action on it so we
can make corrections if need be and you
have so you have some you have some kind
of live link between Houdini and the
engine here well no we don't know see
but I've seen they're fast
it's just so yeah which is really really
convenient so ok actually scaled this
object up which is why we had some
slowdown but what it's like really good
to just do is just to view these things
in editor like it's really quick as we
can so this quickly ago to me and then
you just get up like 50 and then you did
the output back yeah yeah we don't have
any reference item to show the scale
here yeah and that's something which is
yeah something we need to figure out
really um so what I'm doing at the
moment it's just sort of figuring out
what the lighting is going to be and I'm
also going to make this a little softer
to start with
but like what we have at the moment is
really harsh cubes and that's just proof
is lighting a lot more little Mayo like
goes over here cool
our next stages will be to make this
volume look a lot more interesting from
what it is was like fun is that we can
actually get in these they're quite
quick shapes to start with and then also
to add order like low there were
high-frequency detail and that yeah
start looking for locations to actually
put something new and like what we're
going to do is put like a station in and
then we're going to dress up around that
station as well yeah so folks they chat
asking what yes gasps cloud tech could
be used for while we as we stay that
this isn't what's going to be used for
something like Crusader or or even for
atmospheric clouds this can be used to
make the space around a star system much
more interesting and when a mic that
this this is about this is about making
space more than just black empty space
mmm yeah celestial bodies not um not
planets you know you got maybe asteroid
field and then you have a gas cloud
covering it to just make a bit more
derelict ship in the middle of the
nebula or maybe not a spilt oil around a
gas and it forms around the ship and
nebulas are real easy go to like the
Mutara nebula and star trek to any given
day on any given day I'll bring it back
to Star Wars or Star Trek it's gonna be
one of those so know Gombrich not gas
cloud check for cuz there that's a
different tech is what we're saying it's
different they're not the same so this
not being the thing that we're using for
cars a does not mean that Crusader is 2d
said it's a different tech that's being
used for that yeah we kind of ruled out
wanna be explored VIPs and kind of sir
hmm no not quite the tech that we should
be using now there are different
technologies different solutions for
different problems mm-hmm and yeah and
we didn't like yeah it's in policy
wasn't it and we did try it but for what
it is it's not the right thing and
that's and that's sometimes as happens
and that's also just a great learning
experience really of what we're doing so
just do it like that okay so we have a
simple base form at the moment what I'm
going to do is I'd start adding some
noise in and this is going to start
providing us with some actual like
detail on under V DB itself because I
the moment we just got inside large
abstract forms but I really want to sub
distort it more add more noise within
itself and just like make it just a lot
more interesting because at the moment
it's nice that we could do better I
think what we want to do getting count
Flint that's certainly an interesting
question but these aren't the these
aren't the folks would be able to to
answer that remember folks these are VFX
artists so questions today should be
about process and about art if you're
looking for gameplay applications those
are usually the realm of designers yeah
we make the the tools for artists to
easily what make any easier process for
them to actually model this like the so
right now what Ollie's god is a very
flat base form to grow all the larger
shapes but as you can see the CI G cloud
detail doesn't mean it's gonna be it's
for clouds um it's actually just um
inside of this node is a more complex
network which we've simplified to make
the UI just show like new values for
artists to to tweak and to easily create
detail on these gas clouds rather than
having to constantly figure out how am I
going to add detail me and Holly will go
in and explore different ways to do it
and then package these up in a much more
friendly way yeah so at the moment I'm
just trying to add more large-scale
offsets distortions to the volume itself
and then we'll add more of the higher
frequency stuff on the on the gas cloud
say Lord Stiles has a history how can
glass cards or nebulae even exist within
a star system do the pressure of the
solar wind and I'm gonna say that's a
question for the designers we have to
work that out
[Music]
[Laughter]
no that's one of those things that
luckily artists don't have to worry
about you just make the pretty pictures
no after you
what is quite interesting about the by
the gas cloud itself is that it does
drive gameplay parameters so for
instance cider pressure we have an
atmosphere systems within the gas cloud
NC so whenever you go inside the volume
of one it will drive like a pressure
value in the atmosphere and that's
drives other systems so what we can do
is that we actually drive like a
particle effects in there so you see
more different types of particle effects
and idea intensity increases when you go
like deeper in and the pressure gets
bigger so it's quite interesting how
these different systems end up being
tied together and that's something that
like happens quite a lot across that
citizen where we tie a lot of these four
ounces together like folks who saw the
the vertical slice for squadron 42 saw
how the coil had some adverse effects on
the ship systems yeah with that with the
communications being garbled and stuff
like that so it's a there are certain
the gameplay elements to this work but
again those like which gameplay elements
come into play when where and how are
the realm of the system designers as
opposed to the VFX artists as on door
has an interesting question do you find
Houdini pyro PFF do you find Houdini
pyro effects better in your opinion than
non node based pipelines and like a
program like fumefx it's just we were
talking about this earlier I'm biased
towards Houdini's pirate because more of
a any kind of person I've used the
Pirates over and that the whole pirate
tech a bit more robustly and it is
capable of really powerful things that
the one of the perks of Houdini being
node-based is that even the solver they
call the calculation that happens to
calculate how the smoke sim should
operate is all totally exposed so I'm
able to go into essentially the code not
not quite code but like the node that
builds up this entire solver I can
manually tweak the parameters in fume I
can't quite but it is conflict
you pick your tools for it I know fume
does produce results a lot faster a lot
easier than pyro pyro can be a bit they
gotta work a little bit of clay and be I
mean pubes are perfectly valid I think
Jake Gainey our um this assist just
created entitle a new title he was his
assistant art director the last time I
talked to him but oh the thing that was
that yeah yeah yeah yeah he he uses fume
quite a bit he doesn't really use some
pirate and some of the stuff that he
produces just
she was crazy yeah he's gonna like when
I talked earlier about different artists
bringing different methods and different
like and we like learn every time that
we do this like jaded Gainey's when
these people who's done that like he
they he takes these simians from fumefx
brings him into Houdini
and then has them as like separate no
chains so at the moment we're just going
down like one linear path but he would
have like quite a few different aspects
in and then build up and layer up the
simulation and dated BDB grids and it's
a it's a really versatile method and
that's why i fumes great humor with
Houdini is they really like super
powerful and it does everything that we
need it to do so that station does a
little bit to tell us to show us the
scale that we're working at here yeah
I'm just trying to find a nice area I
think where was was yeah we've got
another artist um Jake Dunlop he uses a
particle Sims as his base so we all have
different methods yeah that's one of the
one of the neat things about it we see
this quite often through different
departments and it's EIG it's it's a
push towards using the tools that our
artists are most effective with and it's
a you know if you're if you're more
effective with this then use that if
you're more effective than that then use
that and we we have an entire tools team
that works to build all of the
connectors and the and the translators
that are necessary mm to allow that to
happen that's cool yeah both give quite
they what they all give results like
good results but different results as
well so if you want more of this kind of
like oh we're gonna have to use them the
fumes emulation or if we want another
particular you have to use them a
particle simulation and then we have to
start maybe taking on tools that would
help aid the process so if a artist who
uses fume kind quite get the result that
he wants with the particle that the
particle like workflow produces we've
stuck this word again
what are you nice that's come in it's
like what tools they need to make this
easier so any artist can come and use
this so it's not exclusive to this one
artist haha come it's a game yeah so was
really great like the dispersive
slipping out she like be able to copy
get a volume in turn is that we can just
really quickly fly around it and I made
this pretty big now so it's gonna take a
while to fly around but they could see
like a good like idea of what you're
looking at so yeah it's it's interesting
I think it's still really rough and I
think a lot of what we're gonna make
this session is going to be quite rough
we did a couple of dry runs earlier and
we were going over time so he has a like
speed up a little so will point out the
things where we would spend more time on
and say make a nicer more presentable
because we can see here that we're not
getting very good noise at the moment on
this section and that's something we can
improve further down the line in Houdini
so what we want to do now is add a child
VDB in here so this is going to be a
local really which kinda sits around the
station I think like Jake what do you
think - very do you think I should make
this bigger I think you should in bed
they got embed that station into
something else
it's a well into into the video base
they can I show out of a detail quite
faint like maybe I should put it on here
let's fill on that I come out back yeah
let's do that like a Star Trek Voyager
intro yeah come in there see what
happens
that's cool yeah maybe a gas a gas
mining station who knows yeah okay cool
so let's figure out where this guy's six
is one of the challenges is that when
you get location scouting an engine and
then you try to do it in Houdini you
just get lost very easily because they
look very different your senses
perspective is changed I would say this
I did what I said that's good okay so we
think is you think it's that one yeah
yeah that's right yeah you've got that
whole yeah that looks right gotta guess
where it is I say that's coffee sphere
town see what he's trying to do now is
because if the way that our parent/child
tech works is that when you put in
another video a child VB into a parent V
DB what it actually does is it chops out
that chunk out of the parent and what
you see is the child BD b and some of
the things that can happen is some seams
you'll be able to see like a slight
slight separation between them so the
method that Ali's using is we actually
take we cut the chunk out of the parent
and then we do our process to our Prezi
or add more detail to it so it doesn't
so it still looks connected when you're
really far away but when you're
approaching it with QT for example you
can start to see the detail start to
fade in which is the the entire process
of having a parent-child relationship is
to bring backs on the detail that point
of interest that's lost because your
parent
VDB is just so large yeah this is a
process we had to develop for working on
the coil because we have the coil which
is light it's outstanding location but
it's huge
and we've got to get right inside of it
and as we want to forget spaces in there
which I really tight and also expansive
and 1d issues with working with these
feed abuses that we have this memory
limits
at the moment I got in like quite a
reasonable memory in it yeah it's quite
good but if we go too high what would do
it you just run out of a graphics
processing power and there's a trick
that we can see the force was quite
clearly here that one of these across is
going to be really big if it's just a
huge thing so they cut that moment this
is really kind of small compared to the
coil we had we have a station in there
which is probably about this size and
this the station probably just says sort
of like here and so what we have to do
is have this child there to like make a
play space realistic for us and we also
use this tag for the coil titles and the
interiors as well because we need to
have those a high res like the jump
point that we showed off that citizencon
the the jump point location which the
entirety of that area would sit in maybe
a hundred by a hundred voxel cubed area
you were going to get any detail at all
if we just work to that scale so that
that's where the whole current child
came in we could put in on more high res
VB in that point of interest location to
make it a bit more pretty to look at
rather than just a couple of boxes mmm
that's all you would have seen just
complement boxes with different
densities do you remember oh oh I think
it's gonna come back but it's okay we're
at a point where if it doesn't come back
we'll be okay we've got to save one
let's can we all tab to the other there
well it's well it's well it's
resurrecting itself we had some
questions and chat about how
performative this is this is this is
this something that would chunk the
frame rate as it is right now our
implementation has been no this is
like something we have to keep an eye on
because they rendering 3d volumetric
sand games not many people do it and the
reason why people don't do it is because
it honks your graphics card so like this
is something which we're just always
looking at and this is probably would
like the rendering and how many voxels
we see on screen as well as the lighting
like the lighting cost is a huge thing
as well like a lot of our lights are
quite static in here at the moment we
have like there's like this little
animated light that we can see but
calculating that all the time or
calculating a full light with shadows is
very hard so we have to make sure that
we're doing like a performance analysis
on that all the time like me building it
we're building it in like very just like
logical ways and sort of things which
are going to be just like really bad for
the user for your playing experience so
yeah why we the catalogs actually static
and not like an animated casts cloud
right because it has to do every time
you load a gas cloud it's got to start
calculating the lights it's got to
process the V V file itself and it can
take some time to do so why it's not an
animated because the VDD file format is
actually a static format otherwise you
need to Brenda X amount of files to to
play over each individual frame so these
two the particle simulations are they
generally run on GPU or CPU to symp to
simulate but both actually I think we're
starting to go towards the GPU because
it is just better but before we were
primarily CPU but now we've got a lot of
stuff on the GPU so we're taking a bit
of stress off the CPU just means we can
add more particles right now I know a
lot of that a lot of the prep work for a
Vulcan will will help with that as well
hmm thank you
few of our artists can actually finally
crank up those particle counts and a lot
of kill annoys one in particular no I
pick the wrong area
I say where'd we get that cube from was
the good job that's the right one I
think if you picked the wrong location
nothing to roam it occasionally that
would be very embarrassing on vacation
that's the wrong location I did it I
knew I would do this okay okay this is
no we can fix this don't worry guys
don't worry this is the point of one of
the issues like this is the disconnect
between what you see an engine and what
you see a new Dini
so especially something as big as the
coil it's quite difficult to find what
you are that's why like important for us
that I get this stuff in early and
quickly because we don't want to like
work in Houdini Anika it's a game and
then be like oh I said Oh
like we did for those asking questions
about Vulcan since I mentioned it I
would point you to
calling all devs from a month and a half
ago maybe maybe two months ago we had
our director of graphics engineering Ali
Brown on and he talked to at length
about Vulcan and what you can expect
from its implementation in star citizen
so he already said it far better than I
could so you should check that out it's
up on our YouTube channel right now cool
so what we see now is this is the child
VTB if we if I just turn down the
density quite low you can see it cuts
out the parent one when it renders it
some what we do to do this up roads is
that we take a copy of the highly
high-res version and then paste it back
in to the child and Emory is sort of
like make that more like gradually more
detailed and we put more detail around
that location
because they you want to play around
something that very good happy worldly
just say instead of having like two
large blocks to bits you want to have
late in the final stuff sir
so I'll just go and start doing that I
guess what I'm gonna do is probably
gonna hijack what I did earlier and use
that as a base for making this child VDP
although I should do DM copying of the
diversions wondering what are some tool
I'm leavin they're looking for a joke
volume look funny how much I made it as
well I was gonna say something I just
wanted to say that the keeps keeps just
trying to find the actual location
safety even to make something nice for
us right isn't pressure I for one think
it's going great
[Laughter]
doesn't look like much but it's a one
never does when you take a slice I'll
have a large chunk where's the parent
gone where's the parent guy just gonna
check that get a child from their parent
canvas very careless many cool water
bugs
I wonder if that is oh yeah
Oh have you reached the limit mmm
I might have done there's 25 million so
25 million
no no what you sliced out was 25 million
mm-hmm yeah yeah this is where a Houdini
comes in useful is that it's very
data-driven and we can kind of guess how
it's going to perform an engine just by
looking at the data and the values that
Houdini's analyzing oh are you trying to
figure out why it's so large your
transforms huge it's four times the area
how do you mean that's her or look in
the viewport the cubes massive in
relation yeah and then it's interesting
how it's and you're cutting out oh I see
mm-hmm so it's kinda like doing the
inverse of it it's filling and then
subtracting uh a hollow keep on the
inside sitting me I've got of inputs
wrong way around
there we go okay that's better right now
we're cookin yeah so you can't really
see a change you can kind kind of you
can see that this the seam so it has
copied and pasted across so that once
the space station is now it like a
higher res child VDB so there's no
allowance Wally to add a bit more detail
that you would be able to on the parent
to the points of interest location
we're modeling in the scales quite
tricky because you don't really have a
point of reference on one scale what do
you use how many addresses across you
have to grab the space station it's
about as big as you can get I do use
that reference quite a lot I like
Gladius it's like 40 20 meters across
floating radius wingspan um so there you
have to make sure that like that's like
a nice benchmark to use I could use a
person but like this is star citizen
because it could be got a Gladius it
sees when you can ideas across for
cutlasses position so I gotta just like
start that work for again let's go add
some more stuff on top here should use
the sphere one that was quite good
oh yeah I should use this favor one how
are we doing for time we could probably
do that about 20 minutes left
we'll be faster let's start again
so welcome to saucers in life it's not
there's no one way to do things this 20
ways to do the one thing yeah for it for
everything so I think I like game
development in that game construction
sitting there with a set of blueprints
everything has already been figured out
for you all the engineering has been
done you just you just have to follow
instructions how this works yes so he's
trying to you know create that abstract
shape again to what he did with the with
the grid before to give a bit of
complexity so you want to be able to see
into the sphere right now is just a
create a hollow or 100 field spit words
a film sphere I'm just gonna let you go
I want to see
[Laughter]
you're supposed to be here to save you
and then habits but sometimes I just I
just like to like watch the train wreck
I'm just like yeah I like doing this is
really fun I did a couple of tests over
the last couple of days made sure like
what we're doing might be actually
interesting for everyone and it was just
super light it was a blast
I just working with his tech it's just
it's just great fun it's really easy
it's just great to let use it and you
can just make so much lovely stuff with
it it's that's big one way my favorite
part is working out the different ways
you can you can create it this yeah you
know is the the pyro simulation there's
a particle simulation just build up by
hand they get one point I tried
simulating what life cycle over girls
that went well yeah we should explore
lay again I think I still think it's a
valid method or what moves so what we
were hoping to do was that um an artist
would create a base shape will just
populate an area of them of particles
and you would place the last your bodies
in here like I'm suns and stars and what
we're hoping to do is simulate at a time
if the star gets dense enough your
collapse on itself and explode and spew
more particles and then the gravity of
the star start pillock pulling the
particles towards it and as it dies and
explodes it would push it away can you
tell that Jake was watching a lot of
things physically
yeah I think watch the other Neil
deGrasse Tyson videos I think like
that's a great method by actually taking
from that life as well they were we're
doing wrong here I would actually say is
that we were making relate we're just
creating from randomness and we don't
have lunch like reference in the
background and they when people they
really start doing this they do go get
our reference and it's just you need
that when you're like doing art creation
stuff it's it's really yeah yeah yeah
when you look at why we do concepts
that's why these concepts it's I think
it's quite tricky when you just fill up
like the Eagle Nepean or the Horsehead
Nebula news now I'm gonna model that I
want that to my game you're kind of
saying how do I do it yeah and there's
already like abstracts as well because
there's rent they're like artists
interpretations a lot of time as well so
it's all losing your audio there oh
sorry you hear me okay yeah yeah okay
yeah there a lot of those are artists
interpretations of like what to render
what the the data is so it's kind of its
kind of interesting to try to like find
like the truth in as well so this is
weird it's gonna be I'm saying just
coffee Inosanto yeah that's a let's pose
in now and then see how it looks and
then culottes and see where we've lost a
station well that's got a nice little
pocket down here it's good work ya know
one of the things that is really
important when we're actually looking at
doing this in two locations is actually
bedding it into the scene because right
now we've just got blank space around it
and what we do really is like this
parent that received as big one and the
child the parent is
huge in comparison and that does a lot
of later background space caping and we
do a lot of fading in there and we mix
up with like planes of we use have a
site shader code VFX transparency and we
use that to fill the large areas behind
it and then we start printing the movie
to be on that so they you really bed in
from just like a very soft thing to this
like very wholesome volume and every had
the fine of these her with a child and
then when we go down further they get we
all start Seymour pfx showing up the
ones that are driven from the the gas
cloud itself as well as like the local
effects to they help a space Cape the
scene and that's really important
because I especially like flying through
coil tunnels they give you take a video
importantly a sense of scale and end a
distance around the player so and that's
something that it was quite easy to lose
they where you are within one of these
gas cloud forms say those drop
enlightened yeah when when modeling I
think one of the biggest challenges is
to actually try to make it fit you're
trying to fade it into the universe so
yeah towards the edges you want maybe
like a a simulation or no density fading
from nothing to to something so it just
doesn't look like you've just put a
massive ball of gas right in the middle
of nowhere and just like yes this is
acceptable yes this is how this is how
it is grounding in because I like this
scene that we have at the moment it
doesn't make sense like what is this
thing doing here and that's like what we
have to do we have to like build the
history of like a system off a location
and like what do you environment artists
will tell you later
it's such an important thing to do when
you're making their video games you tell
a story for the Arts in the situation so
yeah like if you put like an asteroid if
you worked like in the middle of the or
the sphere under your parent you could
maybe say oh maybe this was a planet and
exploded and it was just mind and it
collapsed on itself and it really still
the gas and dust is how it came to form
I think you just need to Belva history
to it now can these beady bees be used
for things other than gas like we use
these for asteroid fields or yes I think
we're looking at like um I mean not
nominal but uh I mean it's as much as
you could think of Wow
what other things could use a nebula for
but the the data in herself that the VAP
offers such as density can be used to
help populate from a level so instead of
having an artist hand placing asteroids
in a vast area as large as apparent is
they could put use the BBBS density
value to start spawning asteroids at a
massive vast area and they would be you
know you could have asteroids only in
fairly thick areas so you'd have
asteroids and the more dead spots and
then not so many maybe a couple in in
the low density areas yeah I mean we
have to hear this gas cloud density
which does that I didn't want to show it
to today because a lot of the defaults
are scores and stuff but it's we saw an
image of it yesterday and it was really
phenomenal and I I did play around here
I just pop square in VTB square and put
some rocks in the other day and just
like flew for it was really really fun I
just like dodging around all these
asteroids I mean can be really good when
it ties into game play so if we did have
things like e/m distortion on your on
your ship you know and your mining and
all the asteroids are in the dense parts
with the dense parts is really really
dangerous you know you could actually
lose a ship or we'll just get her just
by mining by getting too close into
venturous
so we start adding some detail in here
I've just lightened it off because
they're still quite thick here one of
the things that we might spend a lot
more time on is making sure that we're
not getting like too much noise down the
voxels as well as like making sure that
weight bedding this parents into the
child they're like I'm really spit
balling with this design but you know
kind of interesting like having this
thing there it's kind of fun
and just answer one of the questions I
saw and someone say with simulation time
it's close to real-time but in Houdini
speaking because we don't we're not
looking for Pyrus or solvers or
simulation to actually give us the
detail we just wanted to give us the
density for us to work with we actually
add the detail after simulation so with
foot with fumes so when an artist
doesn't simulation in fume they will
take it to Houdini and then Houdini can
start processing with that cloud detail
node to add the detail that the solver
wouldn't be able to ever give yeah and
it's like a like it's like we mentioned
earlier as a tools in your in your
arsenal right like all these things and
I every different artist has sort of
like come at it and approach it from a
different method and every every time
they do that we learn this new thing and
I say it's really really fun that's
really exciting so oh yes mrs. more
difficult when teaching new artists how
to make a nebula it's like which method
you want to learn
funny in love the Jake Jake with Jake's
method and Jake I'm up and then me take
that and ollie
Vivi's I if you're cool and you work
with volumetric software please apply
with how many do we have now not enough
bodies I can tell you that as we do
Chris's you ever have to go through the
address book and outlook you and look
for a Chris it's like oh my gosh there's
so many Christians yeah so I read I said
we were actually exploding quite a
low-res maybe so but that's a bit
yeah we'll see when this come true yeah
it's quite nice how we can just export
it what happens in the background is
that we take this VDP file and whenever
we convert it to own a special CID voxel
file and that it's like a lot more more
optimized run an engine and levi's
compress a log two values down because
we don't need all the values that are in
the V to be there later VD we've file
format is a great file format is using
like films games and science but like
and like it's fantastic but like we have
life from zone version yeah because we
have like 32-bit 64-bit values there and
we don't need that for this and so we
like trim things out and you have to
make it better to read so stepping here
that's coming from that coffee paste
what I would normally do is actually
take that high-res version and then add
some more detail in because what we can
see if we look at the volume of slice is
that they disconnect in in the voxel
sizes so if you can see here we have
every polygon here it's one of the
voxels of the iris child and then this
parent is what we see with the blue
squares at the moment and this is
actually a really minor example affair
but like in other cases we'd have like
one blue square but it should be like
half of this so that's really vague
where this parent-child close though
comecomecome
it's a good example for the jump point
that that's what you would have seen if
we didn't have a a child B to be in
there with a much higher resolution
around the points of interest because
all you see is there's some blurry fog
and what we do is that we layer some two
P effects on together paint really
intimate like quite close to your canopy
detail but between that and just had a
big voxel it's there's such a difference
so then we need some intermediate stages
to do that okay question IDs here at
this I mean about three minutes you
actually receive you watching in their
flight around yeah sure that sounds good
but what we could do if if Polly handed
this is a project file to another artist
they could change the sphere to make us
a cinder and run it through the exact
same network you just get an entirely
different result just by changing the
shape or changing the amount of polygons
you had on the sphere itself we could do
that because just completely trash this
but again it's a let's get a screen shot
for the get the money shot for the
YouTube thumbnail and for social media
before we before we mess it up flow it's
just but because it's not destructive
we actually allows designers to create
things like the coil and white box the
coil with VB B's instead of just
geometry they can give Houdini the piece
of geometry Houdini and that's it they
were just hit save and then they get
it's like a I would actually create this
network before before this so it's what
art says this is a nice a nice starting
point this is what we're imagining for
it so when you put your designer
geometry in here this is what it could
look like and yeah and of course because
what it should go with that same we're
gonna say anyway this is less than an
hour's work oh yeah so what we're
showcasing here well we always showcase
on game that is not it's not even a
close approximation to what can actually
be delivered with it with the tools at
our disposal and the work of many folks
on the team going through and optimizing
and cleaning up and yeah let me show you
some of the other examples I did quickly
this is the one we did earlier today and
so this
you can see this big parent here and
then we whack this little station and
down here and the same workfare we have
to say all this local detail you
couldn't do it in the big one but like
this is another like really journal as
well it did if we should have also said
this one was kind of just seen it and
have some quite nice details my local
Charles are very exciting and this was
out of place
what are you over there so there's this
whole time we've been working in a level
that actually had multiple gas clouds
and stations going yeah yeah I mean just
in case like things went wrong I had
backups guys I mean I might like
partially wrong a couple of bytes per
bike ridden as a result of Plan B's and
then I see other guys really I guess
we'd say in three hours you made three
different nebulas in three different
locations and this one this actually
takes pighead as an example I don't know
if he can make make out what I did to
him poor guy
they yeah I see it you see the ice was
the light looks like it's the eye of it
yeah nothing B and they just stuck
another station and it's good fun and
it's just it's just really interesting
you know we can I see the particles here
I don't know if this is going to come
fro on the stream but if you if I like
new free you can just see like these
particle effect I can see them so when
we like fly free we will be able to see
those and that just adds so much more
deeds
oh yeah there's a lot of time it's on as
well say oh yeah you can pop yeah you
can use the entity to drive forces as
well yeah makes a dangerous landing zone
it's interesting how soon babe station
just every citizen with a with a vape
its the requirement all right we are we
are at time let's go ahead and wrap this
up before it degrades any more you can
go and stop the screen share and then if
you can if you will just there you go so
now you're now you're in the big screen
well then now you know you're in the big
screen now I'm now I'm covering you well
then there's no you move places so sorry
so you're just missing Jacob sorry Jacob
hi so yeah so thank you so much guys for
taking the time to be here on the show
with s2o i can get it get jacob in there
somewhere I'll just I'll just do it with
me there we go
sorry wait thank you for taking the time
to be here on the show this this week
remember 3 alpha 3.9 is live on the
servers right now so check that out if
you haven't already and Oliver Jacob
thank you so much for taking time out of
your at your Friday at the end of the
week to be here and take us through your
process is pretty nice too this is my
best angle ever you switched places so I
had to move so yeah so four stars in
life that's Oliver that's right that's
Jacob I'm jarred saying this week
everybody
you
