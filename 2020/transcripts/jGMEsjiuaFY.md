the interactions that we have in our
game
define how reactive the environment is
define how simulated that space feels
how real and immersive it reacts
and is a big part of driving
emergent gameplay of i see a thing
i understand it i expect it to behave a
certain way
and that it does
[Music]
we make zoos primarily to demonstrate
a playground of the functionality that
we have and
also here is an example
setup of how those things are achieved
a designer is able to go in and see that
if they've had any issue with their own
implementation
prior to bothering an engineer they can
take a look
at the gold standard of here's a thing
with nothing else
working see if that gives you some hints
first
before we start interrupting an engineer
if you go in and you find it broken
that's a good that's a good moment to
call an engineer
all that in mind we've been making an
interaction zoo
a place to demonstrate all of the
different nuanced and complicated
interactions that we can get between a
bunch of different entities
that designers can go take a look at and
draw inspiration from
to pull into their levels their ships or
whatever environments we're making
the reason i like zoos philosophically i
believe
as a game designer the two
core parts of gameplay are collision
and doors with our doors we've got all
these automatic doors and those doors
connect between rooms and
every time a door doesn't react the way
you expect it breaks your immersion and
pulls you out of the game
even with something simple like a
control panel we can explore things like
enabling and disabling the proximity
sensor so that you have control over
whether or not it lets you through
automatically or if you have to interact
and make sure it's all working properly
beyond the control panels there's the
doors themselves which give
us many opportunities for complex and
nuanced behaviors
so we've explored things where if you
cut the power to a door
it'll stop its behavior it'll the lights
will go out on the control panel and you
won't be able to interact with it in
that way anymore
but then maybe we make this wedge kit
that you
physically place on the door which prys
it open and
which allows you then to sneak through
and
maybe even past that there's the locks
on the door could be
physical and have their own state and
have their
own health and if those things get
changed
either by some lock-picking gameplay or
some damage or
some external thing that we could
explore even beyond
uh that you might trigger an alarm when
alarm
triggers we want to have that event
actually get passed through
[Music]
the environment and so even
just by having a single chain of
communication
being able to interrupt it at any stage
or alter it at any stage
creates all this opportunity for
subversion
reaction for the doors to get locked
down
and for the alarm lights to go off and
start blaring
or for those things to fail to happen or
get stuck in that state
because something went wrong
or some sabotage went right
as each thing feeds into the next
behavior
it creates a world that feels real
creates a world you can
make a plan for in a world you can react
to
the way in which we interact with
objects in the game world
is essential to creating an immersive
and enjoyable experience
and we hope that many of the
interactions seen here and
quite a few that are maybe a little too
early to share will make their way into
the persistent universe
but before that happens it's time once
again for a sprint report
so let's get to it now there will be
plenty of ship news coming out of iae in
the coming weeks
but let's go ahead and take a quick look
at work from the graphics team
on adding iridescence to the hard
surface shader
seen here on the talon light fighter
from asperia
now coming from the original concept the
iridescent paint allows us to showcase a
variety of
luminous colors that seemingly change
when observed from different angles
this isn't necessarily the final look of
the ship but only a first implementation
of this new aspect of the shader
you can bet that we'll be dialing it in
further and that we'll see more of the
talon in later weeks
ahead of its intended release in alpha
3.12
as part of an overall effort to revamp
and unify the way scanning and radar
works for
vehicles and fps players alike the
vehicle tech team
has progressed on what they're calling
the radar object collection
subsystem now using a temporary back-end
ui at the moment while it's still
being developed this will eventually
form the underlying basis
of finding and filtering almost anything
with an ambient signature
you can see how enabling the resource
filter shows minable rocks ahead
while toggling the infrared adds the
cutlass info that's a bit farther behind
them
now since not all scanning options will
be available in all situations
reducing our options down to a simple
cross-section scan
means that we can see the ship when
unobstructed but that scan data is now
occluded as asteroids or other items
come between you
and your target now as this develops it
will apply to both
ships as well as players or npcs hiding
behind large objects
walls or even doors
meanwhile work on refinery decks
continues with this look at some of the
exterior infrastructure and how that
sits within the upcoming lagrange point
gas clouds
now this review specifically was to get
an early look at what these stations
might look like once they're embedded in
the upcoming alpha 3.12
after some consideration one thought was
that maybe a few more asteroids could be
used to flesh out
and more appropriately theme the
exterior of these refinery stations
that was an easy call but it will also
have to be balanced with our desire to
to avoid turning our major trucking
lanes into obstacle courses
well not all of them anyway and while
the look of these are coming along
nicely
we'll talk more about how actual
refining gameplay itself will work
next week finally let's check in once
again with the ongoing work of our
colonial style homesteads
last time we saw the 2d concepts turned
into 3d concepts
and that was a big step in helping us
visualize and evaluate
the direction we wanted to take them
what you're seeing here
is the next step in that look dev
process where we've now taken the raw
very rough 3d concept meshes and brought
them
down to a planet in engine similar to
the way the team reviewed 3d docking
concepts
by sticking them onto existing space
stations
now it's important to note here that
these are still concepts
and that the process of building them
into viable in-game assets has not yet
begun so let's set our expectations
accordingly
tests like this are used to help us
evaluate things like
shape language how the structures feel
along or against certain landscapes
what kinds of visual stories can be told
through placement
orientation or combination and even
be used to help identify any sort of
structure type that might still be
missing from the proposed toy box
beyond this test it's also just a really
cool look into star citizen's future
when one day frontier towns full of npcs
with jobs or missions can be found
throughout the universe
and then one day later players
themselves creating outposts
all their own rest assured that as work
progresses
we'll keep following
so what'd we learn about this week well
that there's a lot of potential in the
way that we interact with doors
airlocks and more in creating new
gameplay opportunities
that when somebody asks what color your
talent is you can
kind of say all of them the changes are
ahead for scanning and radar
and that someday i'm going to be the
mayor of my own
disco berg or discover
dystopia for inside star citizen i'm

we'll see you next week
