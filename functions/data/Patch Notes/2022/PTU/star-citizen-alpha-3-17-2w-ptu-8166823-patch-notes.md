# Dynamic Event Changes and Bug Fixes
We have made many changes to Siege of Orison mission flow since releasing to LIVE. Some of these changes were hotfixed onto the LIVE environment but many you will see when we run Siege of Orison this weekend on the PTU.

-         Upped the reward for each boss killed
-         Added a reward per AntiAir control regained
-     Players will no longer get a double trespassing crime when the mission is over if you have not left the island (This is now failure to comply)
 There are now 4 stages to the end of mission, the 3 original timers on the last one you get the restricted area warning, you then have an extra 15 mins to leave
-         The mission will end for people not in the zone when the final objective is finished
-         If a player leaves the zone the mission will finish for them
-         Anyone in the mission area when the final timer goes will be arrested but before hand i will complete the mission
-     If the transfer succeeds the next run of the mission (without shutting the server down) the hack should no longer be broken
-     When you destroy ships it will now Play the voice line when you hit a certain percentage of ships destroyed
-         If all types of ships are reduced to 0 it should fail that objective (e.g. if you destroy all the starlifters)
