Testing Focus

**Known Issues**
-     It is possible that some servers may stop updating their mission offerings. If the issue persists, try leaving the server, waiting a few minutes and rejoining the PU, or change region.
-     Attempting to log back into a ship bed may result in a long loading screen before being sent back to the Main Menu w/ Error 30009
-     Players will experience positional desync with one another after they have died and respawned (This latest build has logging enabled to help track this down)
-     Many mineable asteroids can’t be scanned
-     Spawn closets do not recognize unconscious AI and close the door on them possibly leaving mission critical AI unreachable
-     Ships sometimes wont appear in the VMA app unless the player spawns the ship first then spawns a different ship after, only then the ship will appear in VMA
-     Logging out from the Reliant ship's bed and back in will cause the Reliant to be in flight mode and the player is stuck inside the ship sleeping area
-     Cannot Repair, Refuel, Restock at LEOs
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment are missing after being released from Klescher
-     Ship may despawn after player death instead of staying at it's last location
-     Hammerhead doors to turrets may not open for players if they leave the seat during QT, trapping them inside
