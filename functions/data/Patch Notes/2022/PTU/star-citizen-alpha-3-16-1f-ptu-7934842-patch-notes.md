-     It is possible that some servers may stop updating their mission offerings. If the issue persists, try leaving the server, waiting a few minutes and rejoining the PU, or change region.

-     Players will experience positional desync with one another after they have died and respawned
-     Many mineable asteroids can’t be scanned
-     Spawn closets do not recognize unconscious AI and close the door on them possibly leaving mission critical AI unreachable
-     A Shattered Large FPS Deposits base displays a Collectable Diamond Icon
-     Ships sometimes wont appear in the VMA app unless the player spawns the ship first then spawns a different ship after, only then the ship will appear in VMA
-     Logging out from the Reliant ship's bed and back in will cause the Reliant to be in flight mode and the player is stuck inside the ship sleeping area
-     Cannot Repair, Refuel, Restock at LEOs
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment are missing after being released from Klescher
-     Ship may despawn after player death instead of staying at it's last location
-     Hammerhead doors to turrets may not open for players if they leave the seat during QT, trapping them inside

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Derelict Polish pass
Multiple polish passes for lighting, collision, geometry, and adding additional trip-mines.

# Bug Fixes
-     Potential fix for an issue that was causing weapons to holster and unholster unintentionally (This also includes extra logging for the issue just in case)
-     "Get up" Inner thought options should no longer be missing from the Cutlass bunkbeds
-     After dying, the players corpse should no longer fail to spawn, causing permanent loss of their last loadout
-     Item interactions should no longer overlap other items which made it difficult / near impossible to interact with certain items properly
-     Fixed missing central MFD's & annunciator from the AEGIS Eclipse
