Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Testing Focus**
-     General gameplay
-     Scorpius
-     Fleet Week Event Testing
**Fleet Week Updates**
> We plan on running the Fleet Week Expo Halls (minus the Drake hall) and Javelin Tour/Flyby tonight starting shortly after we release to PTU
Any other events/missions around Orison are not intended at this time and are in an incomplete state
-     Expo Hall Lighting, Asset, and LOD Polish Pass
-     Bug fixed - Javelin Tour - AI appear to walk into some walls and barriers after the event has been up for a long period of time or if the server is under heavy load
-     Bug fixed - Javelin Tour - Javelin Tour will not start unless a player is within close proximity to where the Javelin would spawn at Baijini Point and Port Tressler
-     Bug fixed - Javelin Tour - Fixed an issue causing NPCs to double inside the Javelin
-     Bug fixed - Javelin Tour - The Javelin Tour & Bengal Fly-By event location does not appear on the Players Starmap / Skyline App 
-     Bug fixed - Expo Hall - Vision Center shuttle departs early, before players can board / get off

**Known Issues**
After reviewing data and feedback from players we have decided to keep the current Scorpius flight tuning for now
-     The Platinum Bay shops at the reststops will temporarily have the generic depot attract screen on them until the proper Platinum Bay attract screen is created
-     Orison - The AR Marker for the Players designated landing area only appears when the Player gets within a close proximity to the Spaceport
-     Ships can explode after players exit them
-     While docked to a Starfarer the Valkyrie will continuously tilt instead of remaining stationary
-     Damage to player health can become delayed and can trigger after the player has fully healed themselves
-     The Argo Raft's elevator controls cannot be interacted with from either inside deck
-     A ship's targeting pip may be missing or disappear for some players; they cannot be targeted when this happens
-     Character's head, mobiGlas, and other equipment can sometimes go missing after being released from Klescher
-     Medical beacon will not complete mission/payment when player is brought back from incapacitation
-     Coffee Vendor is Unresponsive
