# Star Citizen Patch 3.17.0l
Alpha Patch 3.17.0l has been released to the PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.17.0-PTU.8021249.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER and Shader folders for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU. The Shader folders can be found here C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Star Citizen.

> *Attention* There are some elevator and ship spawning issues with this new build that could possibly be worse than the current PTU. We will be monitoring the PTU and may have to roll back to the previous build if this is much worse.

**Testing Focus**
-     Ship Positional Desync Test
In 3.17.0 we have put in a networking update that should reduce ship to ship desync. We would like to know how well this update works and if there are any observable knock-ons. Relative to 3.16, you should feel as though the facing direction and position of other player ships are much more accurate and real time. We have created a feedback thread in spectrum so please let us know about any potential issues with this that could include ship jittering, rubberbanding, and other effects of that nature.
