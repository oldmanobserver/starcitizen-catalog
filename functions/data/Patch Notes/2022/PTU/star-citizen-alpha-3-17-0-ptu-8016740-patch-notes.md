**Testing Focus**
-     Stability and backend testing
-     Ship Positional Desync
In 3.17.0 we have put in a networking update that should reduce ship to ship desync. We would like to know how well this update works and if there are any observable knock-ons. Relative to 3.16, you should feel as though the facing direction and position of other player ships are much more accurate and real time. We have created a feedback thread in spectrum so please let us know about any potential issues with this that could include ship jittering, rubberbanding, jittering, and other effects of that nature.

The addition of a fully interactable coffee shop vendor in Area18. The AI will interact with three new usables – Hot drink dispenser, soft drink dispenser, and drinks fridge – to serve the player with a variety of new drinks.

Gameplay
-     Ship to Ship Refueling
Implementing the systems that will allow players flying specific ships to refuel other ships and get paid for it. The player can fill those specific ships' fuel tanks from a station using the newly updated Rearm, Restock, and Refuel interface at Landing Zones and Space Stations. The Starfarer has 6 external fuel pods, and each individual pod can be filled with one fuel type of the player's choosing (hydrogen or quantum). This allows players to carry varying amounts of fuel to cater to refueling needs.

Refueling consists of the Fuel Giver and the Fuel Receiver. To start the process, the Fuel Giver (Starfarer) must deploy the refueling arm using the refueling terminal on the bridge. This allows the Fuel Receiver (any ship) to request docking by targeting the Fuel Giver and pressing "N" (default keybind). This sends a docking request message to the refueling ship that they can accept or deny. Once accepted, docking can be done manually by following the on-screen UI or automatically by holding "N" (default keybind).

After the Fuel Receiver is docked to the Fuel Giver, they must use the refueling terminal to define the fuel price. The docked ship can then use their mobiGlas to open the "Vehicle Maintenance Services" app to view the set price and request the amount of hydrogen or quantum fuel they desire. Once they accept the price, the Fuel Giver can open the "Pod Management" screen to adjust flow in or out of fuel pods that contain the desired fuel type. They can then start sending fuel by opening the nozzle and adjusting flow rate, while making sure not to extend past the nominal flow rate for too long. Players will receive a warning error when their flow rate is too high, which can escalate to a danger warning and eventually damage the refueling arm or both ships and result in loss of fuel. When the amount of requested fuel is filled, the player must close the nozzle on the refueling terminal to prevent overflow fuel spillage. Once refueling is complete, funds are transferred, and the two ships can undock from each other by either the refueling ship pressing the "Abort" button on the refueling terminal, or the docked ship holding "N" (default keybind).
-     Shopping and Selling T0
Giving players the ability to sell items from their local inventory to shops using a new interface powered by Building Blocks. This supports the recently added Loot Generation feature, allowing these items to be sold for money. This includes kiosk and service support for sale of non-commodities. The shops will now dictate which items they will buy based on the type of weapons or armor that they sell. Pricing algorithm takes into account state of item, price of closest retail equivalent, etc. This update also bring in wide sweeping changes to what each weapon and armor shop sells. Many higher end items have been removed from weapon and armor shops and can now be found exclusively out in the PU through looting corpses and exploring locations for loot crates.
-     Mining Gadgets
Mining Gadgets are tools to help modify the a rock's properties and assist the player with mining a Deposit. There are many differing gadgets that include stats that will positively or negatively modify rock Resistance, Optimal Charge Rate, Overcharge Rate, Instability, Optimal Charge Window, Optimal Charge Rate, and Shatter Damage. The player can attach a device physically to a mineable deposit in FPS to modify its stats, making mining either easier and safer, or quicker and riskier. Players can currently buy these in New Babbage, Lorville, and Port Olisar and attach them to their backpacks as an equipped item that can be held in the hands by pressing 4 (default keybind) and re-stored by holding R. Once a player finds a minable rock/asteroid they want to mine, they can attach the gadget onto it by walking or EVAing up to it, holding it in their hands, and holding left mouse button to place it on the rock. This will allow players to then modify the signal waves to align them on the mining gadget screen and activate it. Once back in their mining ship, the player can scan the rock and will notice an improvement based on the gadget used. Gadgets are retrievable after successfully mining but will take damage and can be destroyed if going above safe mining levels or overcharging a rock.
-     Ship and Ship Components Inventory Updates
Major overhaul of the ship personal inventory storage to allow for ship components to be stored and transported inside ships. Increased the capacity of Landing zone storage from 100 SCU to 1000 SCU. Added inventory size values to all purchasable ship items along with volume and dimensions which will require certain size ships to transport larger size components that wouldn't normally fit inside the smaller ships. Updated all ships to have more internal storage to accommodate this change. Added inventory filters for components.

Weapons and Items
-     Added Carryable Storage Container to shops in the PU 
Core Tech
- Added Updated GameGlass Keybinds for 3.17
