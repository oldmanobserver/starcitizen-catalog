# New Features
Locations
-     Derelict Reclaimers V1
Added additional points of interest that will be scattered both on planets and in space. These Derelict Reclaimers come with puzzle traversal elements along with multiple legal and illegal mission types which include delivery and FPS combat in and around the crash sites using the new planetary navigation mesh. There are multiple Reclaimer Derelicts in space with three associated delivery, investigation, and mercenary missions. We've also added a new ground-based Derelict Reclaimer site inhabited by NPCs called "Ghost Hollow," which involves delivery, bounty hunter, and mercenary missions.
-     Derelict Colonialism Outposts
Added new derelict versions of the Colonialism Outposts into Stanton. This initial release will see 5 unique outpost locations on microTech with new delivery missions, small traversal puzzles, and all but one of them having AI guards that utilize the new planetary navmesh along with the new drop ship reinforcement system.
AI
-     AI - Planetary Navigation
This system allows NPCs to move on planetary surfaces using a dynamically generated navigation mesh. This will efficiently process planetary terrain and objects to prioritize the processing of the environment around the players into navmesh, allowing the use of all existing functionalities on planets. The first implementation of this feature will be at the Reclaimer and Colonialism Outpost Derelict Points of Interest.
-     AI - Landing Improvements
This enables AI ships to land and deliver reinforcements on non-structured ground areas like planetary terrain where a pre-defined landing area and assistance from Air Traffic Control is not available.
Gameplay
-     Illegal Collect and Delivery Missions
New set of delivery missions focusing on illegal cargo. These will be offered by Red Wind Linehaul once the player reaches rank 2 reputation with them as a courier. The player will be sent generally to sketchy, run-down locations like drug labs and stash houses and is tasked with delivering goods between them, some of which may not be legal. The intro mission should be available in Hurston if you have rank 2 courier rep with Red Wind Linehaul. The illegal missions should be available outside Hurston (in Crusader, ArcCorp, and microTech) if you have rank 2 courier rep with Red Wind Linehaul and have completed the intro mission in Hurston. These missions come in 5 different versions, each with a different quantity of cargo and a corresponding monetary and reputation reward given on completion.
-     Added Marker for Friendly AI that are Associated with your current FPS Mission
Weapons and Items
-     Added New Lootable Item: Greycat Salvage Backpack
-     Added New Armor to Shops and Lootable Containers: RRS Specialist Heavy Armor (Morozov-SH Brushdrift, Redshift, and Snowdrift variants)
