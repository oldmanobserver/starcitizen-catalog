Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Testing Focus**
This PTU cycle accumulates many hotfixes that we have released onto the LIVE environment over the last week which includes many client and server crash fixes as well as new fixes to elevators not working properly, UGF and Siege of Orison AI spawning and behavior issues, and party launching issues.
Today's build has extra logging for Medical service beacon issues. This should help us track down some issues including the beacon not paying out when completing.
