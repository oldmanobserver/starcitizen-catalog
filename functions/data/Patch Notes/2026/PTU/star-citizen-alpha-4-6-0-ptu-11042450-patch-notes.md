# Features & Gameplay
> **Ships and Vehicles**
**LAMP: Light Amplification System**
Adding the ability for Vehicle Cockpits to support light amplification (similar to NVGs) in order to better facilitate gameplay at low/no light conditions.

Enabled and disabled with Right Alt + L by default while in a pilot or co-pilot seat, this system uses the vehicle style shader to amplify the lighting through the cockpit glass itself. This means that all players on the ship looking through the cockpit glass will see this amplification. This system is independent of operator modes and will function within any of them.

In this current release, not all ships are supported but are planned to be updated with LAMP in future releases. Currently supported ships include the Avenger series, Eclipse, Gladius Series, Retaliator, Sabre Series, Hornet Series, Arrow, Gladiator, Hawk, Hurricane, Lightning F8C, Terrapin/Medic, Mole, Defender, Mustang Series, Nomad, Ares Ion/Infernal, Intrepid, Buccaneer, Cutlass Series, Golem/Ox, Vulture, Blade, Glaive, Prowler/Utility, L-21, L-22, P-52, P-72, Fortune, Prospector, Razor Series, Reliant Series, Fury Series, 300 Series, 85x, X1 Series, Salvation, Scorpius/Antares, Scythe, San’tok.yai, Pisces Series, MPUV Series.
