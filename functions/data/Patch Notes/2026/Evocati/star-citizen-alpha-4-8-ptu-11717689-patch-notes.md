# **Features & Gameplay**
> **Ships & Vehicles**
**Vehicle Command Module**
The Command Module feature introduces a new ship pairing mechanic where a smaller, fully pilotable command ship takes control of a larger host ship that cannot fly on its own. For this 4.8.0 PTU, this applies to the Drake Caterpillar. Without a Command Module attached, the host Caterpillar cannot be piloted.

The core flow is: The Parasite docks to the Host and initiates a System Migration Procedure (SMP), a brief transitional phase during which both ships are non-functional, after which the Parasite's pilot gains full control of the paired unit through the Host's systems. The process reverses cleanly on undocking.

Default docking has been moved to a new keybind to avoid collision with landing gear toggle:  RALT+N for Ship-to-ship docking/undocking (preferred over ALT+N to keep ATC requests on tap ALT+N and for HOTAS usability).

**System Migration Procedure (SMP)**
The SMP is implemented as a new mode so it can apply ship-wide changes across UI, audio, and VFX simultaneously to both vehicles.

During SMP:
- All MFDs on both the Parasite and the Host display a dedicated transfer UI showing migration progress
- No thrusters or weapons are operable on either ship
- The command module cannot undock during this phase
- Cockpit lights on the command module change color to indicate the transition state
After SMP completes movement input controls both ships as a single unit. The Power Management MFD controls the Host's power allocation. Self-Status MFD and MFD Casts display the combined Command Module and Host instead of just the command module. All standard vehicle functionality is available: combat, QT, landing services, docking to ships and stations.

Notes: The Host has no pilot-controlled weapons. The command module pilot cannot fire from the pilot seat while paired. Engineering terminals show Host components only. All command module components are disabled and will not appear. The command module cannot undock from the host while docked to a station or docking tube. The reverse (docking to a docked Host) is permitted.
