# Star Citizen Patch 3.10.2
Alpha Patch 3.10.2 has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.10.2-PTU.5883115.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU. 

Database Reset: **YES**
Long Term Persistence: **Enabled**
Pledge Copy: **Disabled**

***Please monitor sc-testing-chat in spectrum for updates and testing instruction*s.**

USER.cfg settings:
r_displaySessionInfo = 1

Testing Focus
-     Persistence Only Testing
> ***IMPORTANT: We have turned off pledge copy so players will only start with an Aurora ES and a Greycat ROC. We have given all PTU accounts 15 million aUEC to purchase ships from in game shops to test a fix to ships persisting in LTP. (If you had a previous PTU account you will start with your old ships/aUEC/items. Please recopy to get a fresh one so that you get the aUEC for testing) Please spawn in a location that sells ships (Area18 or Lorville) and purchase as many ships as you can with this as we will be doing random database resets throughout this PTU cycle to test the persistence of these ships. We would also like players to test character resets after using the ships for a while to make sure they are not removed**.*
