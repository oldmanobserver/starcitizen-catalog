***Please monitor sc-testing-chat in spectrum for updates and testing instruction*s.**

USER.cfg settings: r_displaySessionInfo = 1

> IMPORTANT: With this update we are temporarily removing the chest armor inventory on environmental suits so that the backback will be the only option. In doing this, any items stored in your chest when 3.11b goes live will be deleted. If you have items such as gems or food in your Environmental suit chest inventory please move this to another inventory before 3.11b is LIVE.

**Testing Focus**

**This PTU patch is a quick test to check for stability before going to the LIVE environment.** 

We have added logging into this build for 3.11.0b to help track down issues players are experiencing with losing their mobiGlas and/or missing their heads while switching out armours. This logging will start working once this patch is on the LIVE environment.
