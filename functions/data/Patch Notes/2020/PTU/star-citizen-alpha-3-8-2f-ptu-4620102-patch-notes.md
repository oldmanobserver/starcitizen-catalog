## Feature Updates

Ships and Vehicles

***We have made a couple temporary changes to the Carrack that will help us track down some issues with how it behaves while landed. With these we would like to have people test the Carrack in certain landing circumstances to see how it handle*s!**
***Test out the spawning, landing, and takeoff cycle in hangars and on planetary surfaces as many times as possible. We are looking into the jittering while landed issue to see if it happens more on the initial spawn of the ship or if it continues to happen while landing the ship in other locations either manually or with autolanding in hangar*s.**
- Temporarily increased the spawning requirement on the Carrack to size XL landing pads/hangars.
*We are tracking down issues related to the Carrack clipping into hangar objects and doors and have temporarily made this change while we continue to investigate. This will limit spawning of the ship to Area18 and Lorville.*
- Temporarily removed the ability to swap most components out on the Carrack.
*Due to the mass calculation issues with component swaps we are removing this functionality temporarily while we investigate further. Swapping weapons should still function normally.*
- Temporarily increased the Carrack's QT fuel storage.
*This is a temporary change to help with the lack of ability to use more efficient Quantum drives.*
- Moved Carrack landing gear springs closer to the body to improve reliability while landed.
- Added open/close button near the bottom left of the Carrack ramp.
- Adjusted height of the railing around lifts in the Carrack.
- Completed further lighting polish pass on the Carrack.
- Completed further Carrack VFX, LOD, and Art polish pass.

- Carrack VTOL thruster VFX should now show correctly.

Technical
- Fixed a client crash.
