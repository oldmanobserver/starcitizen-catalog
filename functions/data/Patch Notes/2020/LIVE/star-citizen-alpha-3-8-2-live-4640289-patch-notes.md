## New Features

Ships and Vehicles
- New Ship Available: Anvil Carrack and Anvil Carrack Expedition
*The Anvil Carrack features reinforced fuel tanks for long-duration flight, an advanced jump drive, and a dedicated computer core for jump charting operations. Originally a military exclusive, the Carrack is now available for civilian use. On-board accommodations include crew medical and repair facilities, and a mapping-oriented sensor suite.*

Core Tech
- Added initial long term persistence. (LTP)
*We have added an early version of long term persistence to allow player purchases and UEC earnings to persist between database wipes.  For now, we will persist FPS item purchases, ship component purchases, ship purchases, and UEC earnings. While we intend on minimizing the frequency of wipes and persisting as much data as we can, at this stage in development we will still undoubtedly encounter scenarios that require full wipes. We'll communicate these scenarios as they arise.*
