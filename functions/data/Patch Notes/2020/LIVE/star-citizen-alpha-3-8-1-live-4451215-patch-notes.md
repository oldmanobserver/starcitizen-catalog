## New Features
Gameplay
- Added a separate hostility activation under accidental fire threshold for party members.
- Added wait and instruction objective and timer to patrol mission starts.
- Added a checkbox in game options to disable film grain graphical effect.
- Added target nearest friendly functionality and keybind.
- Camera shake is now a slider option in the options menu.
- Added auto zooming on selected target (default off).
*A subtle zoom on the target when the weapon prediction points, the aiming point, and the look direction align.  Can be enabled and disabled as well as max zoom value adjusted in the game settings.*
- Added basic "MedBed" gameplay functionality.
*Medical beds can now be used for healing and respawn after death. Initial game login is still set by the menu selection, if it's the first login, or by the last ATC landing at a major station. After initial login, players can manually set their respawn to a medical bed by entering the bed and selecting the "Set as preferred ICU" interaction. Medical bed spawning can also be cleared in the same way by selecting "Clear as preferred ICU". Upon death, the player will respawn at the desired medical bed if they died less than 4 million meters away. Currently this functionality is only available on ships with medical beds (just the 890 and the Cutlass Red for this build) and will only work if the ship is available (not despawned or destroyed). If the ship is not available, players will instead respawn at their default location until they have manually set another medical bed. Additionally, if the player is injured they can use a medical bed to heal by selecting the "Treat Injuries" interaction, which is only visible when the player has treatable wounds.*
