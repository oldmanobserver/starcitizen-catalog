# Testing/Feedback Focus
> After a first successful activation of the Ladders V2 feature, we've decided to turn it off for the remainder of the PTU cycle later this week. As stated on the Release View of the Roadmap, we're still targeting a 4.3.0 release and this early activation allowed us to gather some important data at scale on how well existing ladders support the new functionality.  We plan to re-activate the feature in the 4.3.0 PTU cycle. Thanks for everyone who contributed IC reports and shared their feedback!

# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
- Ship Battle Missions will now fail if a player leaves the mission area by more than 12 KM. A 5 second warning buffer will appear once outside the area to re-enter

**Ladders V2**
Implementation of further ladder systems into Star Citizen. This update includes many new traversal mechanics to all ladders in ships and environments around the persistent universe.
This includes:
- Look around while on ladder (180 degree whilst moving, 355 degree whilst stationary)
- Mid point enter/exits
- Being able to Jump off ladders while looking in a direction
- Leaning (used to dodge debris) function
- Collision (e.g. other Actor on ladder) prevents traversal up ladder
- FPS Camera required enter angle
- Ladder exit into crouch/small spaces
- Joining and Leaving a Ladder
Ladders should no longer vacuum up players who happen to wander past and will require an interaction to step on by directly running into them at a direct angle to attach. Approaching a ladder mid-point also provides an interaction to step onto it. 

Ladders can now also be exited by jumping at any point by looking in a direction and jumping. Jump input on its own will cause the player character to let go, and push away slightly from the ladder while using a WASD key while jumping will send the player in that direction. Entering a stunned, incapacitated, overdosed, or dead state will drop the player from the ladder.

> **Core Tech**
- Further Network Updates to help reduce Long Network Thread Stalls
