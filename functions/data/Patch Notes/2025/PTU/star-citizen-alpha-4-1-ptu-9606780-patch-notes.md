Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.

    Long Term Persistence: Enabled
    Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600
    Server Recovery: Enabled

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing. When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus". Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

**Item Recovery T0**
Introducing the first implementation (T0) of Item Recovery - a long-awaited system that gives players more control over their gear after death. 
This T0 initial implementation of Item Recovery will have players respawn with the exact gear they had equipped at the time of death minus stored items in their backpack and pockets.

- Upon death you respawn with your entire loadout (including mags/weapons/medpens) BUT not your inventory. Su you will lose anything in your pockets/backpack. This includes spawning at medbed on ship and back at landing zone.
- Your armor/weapon is then fused to your corpse - so it would have a blocked interaction preventing looting indicated with a red icon and tool tip. On death, held weapon is moved to available holster, to be fused with corpse.
- Ammo, medpens, grenades etc along with anything in your inventory/backpack would be lootable by you or other players.

Note: With T0, players will respawn with their weapon reloaded, this is a temporary thing until T1 is introduced.
