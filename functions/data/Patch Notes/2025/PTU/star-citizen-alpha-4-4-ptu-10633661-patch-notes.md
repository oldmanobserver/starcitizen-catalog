> **Ships and Vehicles**
**MaxOx Neutron Cannon Art Refactors**
Updated several MaxOx Neutron Cannons' art style and geometry: Size 1, 2, and 3.

> **Weapons and Items**
**New FPS Weapon: Ballistic Missile Launcher "Boomtube"**
Three rockets tapped together in a tube releasing this single deadly payload. This weapon has high spread and an arming distance leaning into its chaotic unpredictable nature of finding the sweet spot distance.

The Design intent with this weapon is a high power explosive with a singular magazine, finding the sweet spot between being close enough to deal with the weapons inaccuracies but not close enough to trigger a dud (arming distance). Two key notes is that this weapons projectile is slow (135) and performance is heavily dependent on the gravity of the envrioment as lower gravity allows for less projectile drop 

Boomtube Stats
- Weight: Light
- Damage: Around 2.5x more powerful than a charged railgun 
- Projectile Velocity: 135
- Aim down Sight Time: 0.4
- Mag size:  1
- Spread: High
