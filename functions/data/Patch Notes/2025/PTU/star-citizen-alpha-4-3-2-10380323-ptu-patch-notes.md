# Testing Focus
- Stability & Bugfixes
- Structural Salvage Update (no feedback thread until Econ Balance is done)
# Known Issues
The issues below are meant to help give a better indication on things that may happen during gameplay and do not always occur 100% of the time.
- PU - Stanton - ASD - Location / Respawn Screen - Player will be rescued and respawn back at the facility after being incapacitated
- Multi-Location - PU - Pyro - AI / Locations - Turrets at Farro Data Centers are not firing
- ARGO ATLS  - PU - Mounts / Cargo / Tractorbeam - The ATLS is unable to pull cargo off a ship's cargo grid after it is moved from place of origin to new location
- PU - Stanton / Pyro - Armor / Loot Box / Inventory / Actor - Equipment and armor dropped on the ground will be suspended in mid-air making them unable to be interacted with

# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Structural Salvage Update**
Structural salvage has undergone major changes to prep for future systems. This will affect all salvage mechanics for all ships and will increase complexity, adjust salvaging times and materials collected, and add refining as part of the flow for materials.

**Ship Identity & Role Definitions**
Each salvage ship now has a distinct identity and specialized role:
- Reclaimer: "Quantity over quality" - Fastest structural salvage processing, designed for large-scale operations
- Vulture: "The Lone Wolf" - Balanced middle-ground ship, serves as reference point for all other ships

**► Technical Changes**
**Field Generation System**
- Increased Range: Fields have been increased by up to 60 meters from where they were before
- Ship-Specific Fields: Each ship now generates differently sized fields matching their visual design
- Repositioned Sweet Spots: Alignment sweet spots moved from dead center to ship-appropriate positions
**Fracture Time Rebalancing**
- 5x Speed Differential: Massive performance gap between fastest and slowest ships
- Speed Rankings (fastest to slowest): Reclaimer (fastest), Vulture (reference baseline)
**Conversion Rate System**
- SCU per Cubic Meter optimization varies by ship
- Current Live Rankings: Reclaimer (best available)

**► Field Alignment Sweet Spot Overhaul**
**Massive Multiplier Buffs**
- Reclaimer: 7x speed multiplier when properly aligned
- Additional: Yield multipliers also improved for aligned positioning
**Visibility & Mechanics**
- Sweet spots display +/- percentages on debris pieces
- Easier with tractor beam ships, but possible through flight positioning

**► Material System Variances**
**Raw Material Types**
All structural salvage now produces raw materials requiring refinery processing:

Powder: Highest density, Lowest yield after refining, Fastest refinery processing time.
Scraps: Medium density, Medium yield and processing time.
Chunks: Lowest density, Highest yield after refining, Longest refinery processing time.

**Refinery Integration**
- All refinery decks can process these materials
- Same end product: All materials refine into construction material
- Workflow: Raw materials → Station inventory via freight elevator → Refinery processing
- Time Design: Small ships get quick turnaround, large ships have extended processing but higher profits

**►  Strategic Implications**
**Operational Models**
- Solo Players: Use small ships for immediate gratification and quick profits
- Group Operations: Use Reclaimer for high-volume operations with delayed but substantial payouts
- Mixed Operations: On-site salvage production with dedicated transport ships for raw materials
**Economic Balance (incomplete for this Evocati build)**
- Crew Compensation: Reclaimer profits designed to support full crew payments
- Session-Based vs. Delayed: Small ship profits available immediately, large ship profits require waiting periods
- Volume vs. Efficiency: Trade-offs between processing speed and total yield
**►  Future Integration (Crafting System)**
**Stepping Stone Design**
- Current system is not a placeholder but foundation for post-crafting implementation
- Refinery processing times and quality retention mechanics will remain consistent
- Quality System: Chunks will retain material quality better than powder, affecting refining times

Additional Gameplay Updates
- Balance update for FPS tractor beams for snappier movement, faster rotations, and longer break times
- Updated “Sweep and Clear” missions to only display mission locations in the player's local planetary system
