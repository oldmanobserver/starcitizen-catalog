# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0.2
Alpha Patch 4.0.2 has been released onto the PTU environment!  Launcher should now show: VERSION 4.0.2-PTU.9567476.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

# **Testing/Feedback Focus**
**4.0.2 Release Goals**
The 4.0.2 release is highly focused on 3 key points to improve and fix as many top key gameplay issues as possible, improve connectivity/stability, and begin the latest Supply or Die Pyro Event.
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Supply or Die Event

- Tonight's build has further updates for Transit Carriages opening into Incorrect Zones and causing voids.
- Further Entity Cleanup work has been done to help stop certain entities, such as ships, getting cleaned up when they shouldn't be.
- Pyro missions for CFP/HH should be not sharable without having sufficient reputation. In Stanton this does not apply.


# **Known Issues**
