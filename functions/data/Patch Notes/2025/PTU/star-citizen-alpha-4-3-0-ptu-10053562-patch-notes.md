# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.3.0
Alpha Patch 4.3.0 has been released to all backers! Patch should now show: VERSION 4.3.0-PTU.10053562.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, unstowed vehicles, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: All Backers
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Territory Configuration: 7:3:600 (Updated Territory Config)
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing and subject to removal.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.
