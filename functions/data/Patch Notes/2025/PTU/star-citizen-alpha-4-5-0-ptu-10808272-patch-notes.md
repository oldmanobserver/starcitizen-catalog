> **Ships and Vehicles**
**Snub Fighters and Interceptors balance pass**
Patch 4.5.0 introduces additional tuning refinements to the Snub Fighter and Interceptor classes, with a focus on strengthening their unique roles, such as combat or racing.
**Ships involved: **MIRAI Fury (and variants), ORIGIN 85X, KRUGER, P-52 KRUGER, P-72, MIRAI Razor (and variants), ORIGIN M50, AEGIS Avenger (and variants), ORIGIN 300i series.
**Performance Changes:**
- A comprehensive rebalance of flight performance has been implemented across all the ships listed above.
- SCM/NAV speeds, Linear Acceleration (Gs), Angular Rotation, and Angular Acceleration have all been updated to align these ships with the broader tuning revisions introduced in earlier patches.
- Critical HPs have been rebalanced, making small snub ships generally less durable.
- Racing-dedicated ships received tailored tuning passes to enhance their flight performance while reducing their combat effectiveness (Fury LX, Razor LX, M50, 350r).
**Other significant additional changes:**
- Racing ships now generate 20% higher emissions compared to their combat counterparts.
- Racing ships have an increased MM spool-up time (+5 seconds).
- Racing ships now benefit from a larger Boost capacity (+25% over standard ships).
- Snub Fighters and Interceptors now take 10% additional damage from all sources, reflecting their intended fragility.
We will continue to monitor these classes closely to ensure they fulfil their intended roles as new game systems and features are introduced in the PTU cycle of Alpha 4.5.0.
