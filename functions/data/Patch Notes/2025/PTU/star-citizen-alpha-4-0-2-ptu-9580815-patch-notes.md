# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0.2
Alpha Patch 4.0.2 has been released onto the PTU environment!  Launcher should now show: VERSION 4.0.2-PTU.9580815.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

# Testing/Feedback Focus
**4.0.2 Release Goals**
The 4.0.2 release is highly focused on 3 key points to improve and fix as many top key gameplay issues as possible, improve connectivity/stability, and begin the latest Supply or Die Event.
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Supply or Die Event
Tutorial Missions have been disabled for 4.0.2. For tonight's build, you may see a black background on the menu screen.
We have finalized fixes for the largest causes of long load times into the PTU, especially into certain Pyro locations.
