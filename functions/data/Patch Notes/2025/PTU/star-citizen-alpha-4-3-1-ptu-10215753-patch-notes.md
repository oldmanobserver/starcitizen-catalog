# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Onyx Facilities**
The Onyx Facilities used for the new investigation missions in 4.3.0 have been expanded to include mission content beyond the previous releases. This continues after completing the original Jorrit's missions with a new mission that delves you further into their story.

**MedGel - Medical Respawn Resource**
Medical bed respawning in ships has undergone a significant change to their function to balance their use. Ship Medical beds will now require a resource that it uses to respawn players and heal tier injuries. This is a brand new MedGel resource that can be purchased in medical facilities as an item the player can store and manually use each time the medical beds needs refilling. Different tiers of medical beds will allow for differing amounts of respawns before needing to be filled.  Respawning and healing tier injuries will be quite demanding so make sure you top off your medical beds to be sure you have enough for your next respawn or you will be sent to your home location on death instead.

> **Locations**
**Dropships & Watch Towers**
Dropships have been re-implemented into the persistent universe in Pyro. At various outposts across Pyro, dropships will spawn when the location population is reduced by a certain amount (ie they are killed). These dropships will spawn, land, deploy reinforcements and then leave. The reinforcements should exit the dropship and search the area for hostiles. They should be allied to the local population. At each location are watchtowers each of which has a terminal at the top. If the player disables all the terminals at a location then no dropships will spawn. There are also missions that require the player to disable all the watchtower terminals at a given location.
