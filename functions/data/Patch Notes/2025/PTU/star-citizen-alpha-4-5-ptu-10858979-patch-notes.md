# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Engineering and Fire Gameplay Updates**
Updated chance for critical part explosion to 20% and updated AI to reflect AI specific explosion behavior (will help with ship combat missions). Shield bring up health and regen to match 4.4 damage of weapons. Increased repair tool repair rates. Increased amount of damage fuses take (will take more damage). Reduced armor resistance modifier back down to 0.85. Updating Extinguishers in the Carrack, Medivac, Reliants, and MPUV. Temp disabled additional Engineering screens in Polaris/Perseus till multiple are supported. Shops will now only sell fully filled RMC canisters.

Design Doc Wear and Fuse Amendments: In the current build, wear and tear is mostly disabled and will not take into account time when factoring in wear as this timer is not functioning as intended. Fuse loss has been amended to reduce power pips based on the amount of relays with damaged or missing fuses. If you lose all fuses inside a relay it still connects all items, but you have less power available in the entire ship. You will lose power pips based on the relay that does not have any fuses anymore. All components can currently be replaced or repaired at stations. While Size 1 and Size 2 components can be manually replaced while in flight, Size 3 and larger components need to be repaired or replaced while docked at a station.

> **Ships and Vehicles**
- PDCs will now target and shoot Bombs even if not hostile
