A Revolution in Tactical Firepower. Starting as a high-impact, close-range weapon, this Adaptive weapon evolves as you fire, building heat and transforming into a precision slug shotgun capable of punishing enemies at a distance with terrifying force. Operators must monitor heat buildup carefully. Sustained fire can lead to overheating, reducing efficiency and leaving you exposed. Environmental factors play a crucial role and atmospheric temperatures will affect heat generation, meaning your battlefield tactics must adjust with your surroundings.
