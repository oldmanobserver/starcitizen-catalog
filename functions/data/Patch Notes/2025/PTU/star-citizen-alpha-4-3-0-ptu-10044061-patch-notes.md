# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.3.0
Alpha Patch 4.3 has been released to all backers! Patch should now show: VERSION 4.3.0-PTU.10044061.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar  layout, unstowed vehicles, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs,  and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which  will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: All Backers
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Territory Configuration: 7:3:600 (Updated Territory Config)

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing and subject to removal.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**

Full Polish Pass on Mission, Location, VFX, and Audio/Music. Updated the intro audio log mission text to mention the QT limitations. Further Updates to add more ledge grabs. Tweaked entrance cover.

> **Ships and Vehicles**
**Light Fighter Flight Tuning Changes**
Following the flight tuning adjustments Heavy and Medium Fighters in 4.1.1, 4.2.0, and 4.2.1, additional updates have been included in the 4.3 release. 
This patch introduces further refinements across the entire Light Fighter class.

Ships Involved:
- Aegis Gladius (and variants)
- Anvil Arrow
- Anvil Hawk
- Banu Defender
- Esperia Talon (and Shrike)
- Vanduul Blade
- Aopoa Khartu-Al
- C.O. Mustang (all variants)

Speeds:
- The SCM and NAV speeds for most of the listed ships have been readjusted to introduce greater variation within the Light Fighter class.
Linear Accelerations:
- The tuning for all linear acceleration profiles across most ships in the class has been revisited to introduce more variety and expand the range of viable choices during both flight and combat.
- This pass is intended to create a more engaging and balanced environment, with each ship offering more distinct and specialized flight characteristics.
Angular Speeds:
- The overall angular speed has undergone the same treatment as linear acceleration, with the goal of increasing variety and emphasizing unique flight characteristics across the class.
Angular Accelerations:
- Angular acceleration tuning has been revisited to correct sparse issues and establish a more consistent and coherent setup across all Fighters. 
- As a result, ships in this class now offer improved rotational responsiveness across all directional axes.
HPs:
- Some ships have had their health pools adjusted to better align with the overall balance framework.
Other fixes:
- Engineering Weapon Modifiers: some ship received a specific Weapon Capacitor modifier to improve their weapon offensive capabilities.
- Khartu-Al Wing Tips Bug: the behavior where destroying the ship's wing tips resulted in significantly improved flight performance has now been corrected and will no longer have a major impact on the flight profile.
- Talon Shrike Flight Controller: this ship now features a dedicated flight controller, slightly different from the original Talon’s, to ensure its flight performance aligns with its intended role and loadout.
> **Core Tech**
- General Performance Optimizations
- Further Audio Updates to help with Client Crashes (This will not fully resolve the issues but should bring it back more in line with 4.2.1 while we test potential fixes internally )
