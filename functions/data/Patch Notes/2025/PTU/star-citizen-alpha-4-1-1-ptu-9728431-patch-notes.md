# Features & Gameplay

- **Locations**
- Further Expo Hall and Fleet Week Polish Pass


- **Gameplay**
- Enabled PVP Bounty Contracts
- Removed negative rep gain for Ambush Missions for Foxwell and Headhunters


- **Ships and Vehicles**
- Added on / off Toggles for Ship Speed Limiter
- RAFT Thruster Retuning after its latest Cargo Update
- Polaris Turret VFX Polish


- **Weapons and Items**
**Ripper SMG**
- Full damage range increased from 20 to 22.5
- Damage Fall off now starts at 22.5 and scales to 0 at 35m


**Quartz Volt SMG**
- VFX Beam Polish to increase diameter
- Full damage range decreased from 20 to 15
- Range reduced from 50 to 25

This range was tucked in because the damage has linear falloff meaning targets would get damaged but would take minimal damage
tucking in the damage range makes feeling a good range out of the beam weapon easier
We intend to make the damage not have a linear fall off in the future
