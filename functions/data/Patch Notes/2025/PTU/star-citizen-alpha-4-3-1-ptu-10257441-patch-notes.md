# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Onyx Facility and Mission Polish**
Adjusted rewards given for Onyx Facility completion to be based on path taken. Made dozens of audio updates for location ambience, audio logs, wildlines, audio mixing pass, and more.

> **Locations**
**Lorville Weapon Vendors**
Removed placeholder Lorville security office kiosks and temporarily moving FPS weapons into Tammany and Sons inventory until Security Office can be added.

> **AI** 
**FPS AI Death Behavior**
Integrating much of the human death animation and behavior from SQ42 into the PU. This will bring much more proper death and hit animation reactions when engaged in FPS combat with AI.

> **Ships and Vehicles**
**Armour and Ballistic Damage changes iteration pt.2**
In order to enhance the overall ship ballistic weapons in gameplay the team iterated on these changes during the PTU cycle for the upcoming patch.

Base armour ballistic reduction damage has now been set to 38% across all ships (previously 50% in 4.3.0 and 40% in 4.3.1 PTU) with some few exception that the team think required a specific unique tuning. This means that ballistic guns will be more effective across the board against all targets, especially when shields are down.

Shield ballistic absorption reduction damage has now been set to 45% for all shields (previously 30% in 4.3.0 and 20% in 4.3.1 PTU). This means that ballistic guns will be less effective across the board against all targets when they have their shields up and running.

> **Weapons and Items**
- VOLT LMG Audio and VFX Polish
