# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0.2
Alpha Patch 4.0.2 has been released onto the PTU environment!  Launcher should now show: VERSION 4.0.2-PTU.9587261.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update. This will also include contested zone keycards, weapons, and salvaged items and components for this update.
