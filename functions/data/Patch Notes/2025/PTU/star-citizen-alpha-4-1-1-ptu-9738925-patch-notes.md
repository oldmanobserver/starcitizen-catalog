# Features and Gameplay

- Core Tech
**Synchronize Party Launch**
Updating the Party Launch feature to have better functionality for server queues.

When party leader joins PU from the front end, party launch notifications are now sent as soon as the Party Leader joins a Shard Queue so that the party is all queued at the same time.  Previously, the party launch notifications were taking place after the party leader transitions into PU so this will make the process much cleaner for parties when there is a longer queue. Along with this, party launch UI notifications are now displayed. If party leader cancels a Join Queue, party members still in queue will also get a cancel (with UI notification indicating the party leader canceled queue).
