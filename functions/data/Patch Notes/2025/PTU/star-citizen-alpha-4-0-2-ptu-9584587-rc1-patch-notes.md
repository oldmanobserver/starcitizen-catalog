# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0.2
Alpha Patch 4.0.2 has been released onto the PTU environment!  Launcher should now show: VERSION 4.0.2-PTU.9584587.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update. This will also include contested zone keycards, weapons, and salvaged items and components for this update.

Audience: All Backers
Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
Mesh Configuration: 5:5:600

# Testing/Feedback Focus
**4.0.2 Release Goals**
The 4.0.2 release is highly focused on 3 key points to improve and fix as many top key gameplay issues as possible, improve connectivity/stability, and begin the latest Supply or Die Event.
- Stability, Performance, and Bugfix Testing
- Supply or Die Event
Medical Beacons have been disabled while Tutorial Missions have been re-enabled for 4.0.2
We have finalized fixes for the largest causes of long load times into the PTU, especially into certain Pyro locations.
