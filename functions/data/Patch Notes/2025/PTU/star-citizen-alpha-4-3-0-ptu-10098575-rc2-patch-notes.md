# PTU Update - 10098575
We have released a new 4.3.0 build onto the PTU environment with much needed fixes for the Wolf. 
- For players on PTU giving the Wolf a spin, let us know if you run into the desync/zone transition issue.
We're looking for confirmation of big improvement on the exit animation desync issue on the Wolf with the update.

As I mentioned above, one player observer, one pilot. Pilot enters wolf, exits wolf, moves away from the ship. If observer sees player stuck to the ship, bug still present. (Can still desync but it should never be permanent). Repeat multiple times (10+!). Try in hangar and planetary locations.


# PTU Hotfix Update - 10092193
We have released a client hotfix to the PTU to resolve a Wolf ship related crash. Let us know if this helps!
- 	Potential Fix: PU - ASD Delving - Phase 1_M3 / Phase2_M1 - Missions / Network - Missions will fail to populate in the contract manager on certain shards
- 	Further Audio Crash Fixes
- 	Main Thread Deadlock Fix

# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.3.0
Alpha Patch 4.3.0 has been released to all backers! Patch should now show: VERSION 4.3.0-PTU 10082412

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, unstowed vehicles, custom characters, in-progress refinery jobs, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the update.
- Audience: All Backers
- Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
- Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
- Territory Configuration: 7:3:600 (Updated Territory Config)

# Testing/Feedback Focus
- Stability & Bugfixes
- Onyx Facilities
- Mission Distribution Updates
- Hangar Spawning
- Dynamic Snow
- Updated Ladder Improvements
- Light Fighter Tuning Changes
- VOLT Laser Sniper "Zenith"
- Additional Wikelo Special Ships
- Additional Player Hairstyles

In tonight's build we have further audio adjustments around ships that may slightly decrease their audio fidelity but will mitigate nearly all crashes until we are able to get a wwise update in an upcoming release.

Tonight's build has further freight elevator repair work implemented that should self detect many issues encountered and reset the elevator affected. We believe this will help with many of the issues occurring but possibly not all. A side effect of this reset is that it can cause cargo on the lift to be deleted if it breaks while cargo is on it. This should be rare but mentioning here in case this occurs. Please keep an eye out for any new issues occurring!
