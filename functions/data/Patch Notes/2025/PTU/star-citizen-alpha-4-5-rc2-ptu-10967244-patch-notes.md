# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay**
**Engineering Balance Updates**
Ship Overkill: Once all ship parts reach 0 health we activate another health pool buffer (this amount is hidden). Once the buffer reaches 0 health, it will trigger an unavoidable explosion of the ship. If the player manages to repair the hull (to counter it), the buffer is ignored. If the hull reaches 0 health again the buffer starts again.

Multi-shield Implementation: When a ship now has more than 2 shields, all shields will contribute to overall shield health, even the ones not given power by the generator. This will affect overall regen speed as the regen speed of up to 2 shields will be used based on power assignment. By default the shields with lowest minimum power requirement will be powered first.


**Ore Refining Economic Balance**
Refining of ores has undergone changes to a smaller volume of yield output (From ~85% to ~45%) while significantly increasing the refined sale price to compensate. Effectively, you can now transport more value of refined ore with smaller SCU space with this latest update. 

The base prices of nearly all commodities have been significantly increased across the board. This affects all major brackets of sandbox commodities. (32/24s, 16s, 8s, and 2s). Price differences within brackets have been pressed closer together in order for dynamic pricing to better influence which goods are optimal.
