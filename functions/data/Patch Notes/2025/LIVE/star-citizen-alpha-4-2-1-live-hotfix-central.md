Hi Everyone!

Time again for another Hotfix Central thread to keep you all up to date on things going on outside of the normal patch cycle in SC Alpha 4.2.1 LIVE!
This will be a living document of all the hotfixes applied to the current LIVE environment, along with dates as a timeline and when the HOTFIX channel is open and closed.

These posts will be locked down to comments as the updates will span the entire 4.1.x cycle so please check out the issue council and testing chats for any information you would like to let us know about!


# Current 4.2.1 LIVE Status | 7.29.2025
With the new release of SC Alpha 4.2.1 LIVE, we are currently looking through hotfixable issues that can be addressed and will update here as soon as these fixes are ready for release.

► **7.29.2025: **As of this morning, All Clients and DGS have been updated with the latest hotfix CL# **10007308 on**the LIVE environment with fixes for stacking cargo on freight elevators.

► **7.23.2025: **4.2.1 LIVE Has been updated with the latest **9982497 **Client/DGS hotfix to address these two issues.
STARC-174022 PU - Freight Elevator / Cargo - Cargo area is present on top of Freight Elevator building and placing loose items there will cause "Internal Error"
STARC-174557 PU - Resource Gathering - Missions - Resource Gathering Intro / Hauling - Contract unable to complete when there is noticeable "amount/total" in the contract.

► **7.22.2025: **Along with the LIVE maintenance today, we have updated all the clients and shards to the latest **9978513 **hotfix. This includes a few updates and fixes for Freight Elevators, Missions, and Linux.
- There is an additional service side hotfix to allow small, med, and large cargo hauling missions to round robin across locations and have higher availability 
- PU - Freight Elevators - Accessing the Freight Manager during item transfer can cause items to not register in the location inventory and can prevent mission completion
- STARC-174707 PU - Freight Elevators - Multiple Locations - Non-instanced Freight Elevators won't lower and items placed on them won't register in the terminal if the platform is streamed out without the manager being streamed out
- STARC-174915 Linux users are unable to load main menu after 4.2.1 hotfix #9970231

**7.21.2025: **We are currently preparing further hotfix updates for the LIVE environment with further mission flow fixes for sending cargo pickups to more locations, cargo platform fixes (STARC-174707), and Wine connection issues (STARC-174915). These will start rolling out to the HOTFIX channel and LIVE servers tonight and over the next couple of days.
**7.20.2025: **Client hotfixed with **CL 9971117 **with further contract location updates to spread out mission locations
**7.18.2025: **Client hotfixed with **CL 9970231 **with further top client crash fixes. DGS hotfix **9970231 **is rolling out and will take a bit to fully propagate across all shards.
This update includes 2 fixes and additional debugging for client/server performance to track down the cause of noticeable issues

► STARC-174557 PU - Resource Gathering - Missions - Resource Gathering Intro / Hauling - Contract unable to complete when there is noticeable "attempt/total" in the contract (Requires a hotfixed DGS)
► A Fix for the top client crash

# Current Hotfixes in Testing (7.18.2025)
We are currently looking into multiple hotfixes in relation to the new Resource Drive event on 4.2.1 and will update here once we have further information.



# Using the HOTFIX channel
The HOTFIX channel will become available for periods of time when the client-side of the game needs the hotfix. This channel will point to the LIVE environment and using this will retain and add progress to your LIVE account as if you were playing normally.
The best way to play on HOTFIX is to rename your LIVE folder to HOTFIX and verify using the HOTFIX channel on the launcher. Reverse this process to go back to LIVE once it is released or you would like to stop using this channel.
