# Features & Gameplay
> **New Star System: Nyx**
Implementing the Nyx star system into the persistent universe. In tonight's build, Nyx will include Delamar, Levski, and New Jump Points, but not the three planets Nyx I, Nyx II, and Nyx III.
For this initial test, we are expecting Cross-System hauling and Exterior Freight Elevators to partially function but we are not collecting feedback on this just yet.

> **Ships and Vehicles**
Patch 4.4.0 introduces further refinements to PDT tuning and their interactions with Missiles and Torpedoes.

**PDT changes**
- PDT's guns alpha damage has been reduced by 50%, resulting in an overall DPS decrease.
- PDTs mass has been lowered, as their previous weight was considered too high.
**Missile/Torpedoes changes**
- Missile health has been reduced by the same percentage as the PDT alpha damage reduction (approximately 50%).
- Torpedoes health has also been reduced, though to a lesser extent, around 33% less HP overall.
**Additional Ship Updates**
- Anvil F8C Lightning: Buffed Forward Gs and Roll angular speed
- Slight adjustments to angular acceleration to the Anvil Hawk, Anvil Arrow, and Esperia Scythe
- Slight Medium Interceptor tuning improvements for flight performance (Saber Raven/Firebird, Buccaneer, herald, Mantis)
