# Features & Gameplay
> **Gameplay Updates**
**Engineering Gameplay**
Introducing dedicated engineering roles aboard ships, allowing players to actively manage power distribution, repairs, and system efficiency in real time. The overall goal and experience with this Engineering update should see ships behaving approximately as well as 4.4.0 in combat and surviveability with the added bonus of engineering and multi-crew to extend this beyond the capabilities of 4.4. Beyond this, players may need to check on their ship between battles to make necessary repairs so that they are fully prepared for their next encounter.

This introduces numerous updates to all ships and vehicles with the initial implementation of ship armor loads of updates to heat, power, and life support management, diagnostic and engineering screens, large sweeping changes to ship component health, damage resistances, and heat generation, hull health and weapon balancing, as well as updating the repair tools needed for the job.

Since the previous Tech-Preview, we have made dozens of fixes as well as updates for balance and UI and further updates for more vehicles. Deactivated fire for bullet hits as well as overheating of powerplants, increased coolant provided by the coolers, reduced critical powerplant failure point, updated armor to have health again, fixes to ballistic cooldowns, reducing radar heat, and ship health now tied to critical health.
As this new update affects every ship and vehicle in the game, many further updates and balancing will be down during the coarse of the PTU phases for 4.5 and beyond.

**Ship Fire Hazards**
Bringing fire hazards to ships and environments, along with Fire Extinguisher mechanics, requiring players to manage and extinguish blazes before they spread. This includes retrievable fire extinguishers aboard ships that have a limited use before needing to be recharged.
> **Weapons and Items**
**Physical Helmets**
Implementing physical helmets in the persistent universe. Pick one up, rotate it, inspect every detail, carry it around, attach it to your hip, or toss it across a room if you want. When you equip a helmet, you put on or remove the same one you held in your hands, complete with a fully realized interior.
> **Core Tech**
**Vulkan Renderer Improvements and GPU Settings Updates**
Increasing both the stability and speed of the Vulkan renderer, with many crash fixes, diagnostic improvements, and multi-threaded render-submission, while adding support for HDR and NVidia's DLSS Transformer model. Also included is an overhaul to the Graphics Options, with many new settings, and a VRAM bar to help players configure the graphics for their GPU.
