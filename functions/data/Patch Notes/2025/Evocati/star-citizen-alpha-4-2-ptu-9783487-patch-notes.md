# Features & Gameplay
- **Gameplay**
**Farro Data Center - Part 1 of New Activity**
This new activity takes place in both Stanton and Pyro at multiple different locations. For tonight's build, we will focus on Farro Data Center on Pyro IV and ends at Step 4 of the list below. This location has multiple locked doors that take different types of credentials to open such as key cards, "computer data security", and uses a new mechanic that requires certain clothing for the door scan to allow you entry. How you get this clothing is up to you. We will keep the details beyond this at a minimum to test the in-game communication and discovery of this activity.

The activity for this first part will be held at Farro Data Center on Pyro IV
1. The Data Processing Room is locked by doors that require a Technical Access Card to open
1. Technical Access Cards can be found in various loot rooms at the location
1. Inside the Data Processing Room, the players find the Credentials Printer that can give them the Doctor’s Credentials
1. The printing process takes time and causes the alarm to go off, drawing security reinforcements to the Data Processing Room
