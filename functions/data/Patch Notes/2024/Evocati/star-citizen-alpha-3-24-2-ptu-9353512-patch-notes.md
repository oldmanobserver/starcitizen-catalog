Server Info: PTU Channel - US Only
Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000
Shard Player Count: 100

The current build is under NDA (Talking about features and testing is allowed but no sharing of game video, screenshots, audio, files, or accounts outside of Evocati)
Please log out then back in on the issue council site to see the Evocati environment there. Please make sure to only select the Evocati 3.24.0 environment when creating IC reports while the builds are Evocati only

***Please monitor etf-testing-chat in spectrum for updates and testing instruction*s.**
Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.


# Testing/Feedback Focus
