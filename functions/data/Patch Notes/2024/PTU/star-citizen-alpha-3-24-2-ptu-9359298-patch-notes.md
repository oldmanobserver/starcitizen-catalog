# Features & Gameplay
**Gameplay**
- MFD button bindings
A lot of MFDs button bindings were unlocked, some are still hidden away while we work on some stuff. Right now you will find bindings for:
- Select which MFD you want to cycle to
- Change the displayed page of a selected MFD
- Directly jump to a specific MFD page
- Options for persistent ship settings + MFD page
Ships and gunnery seats have so-called persistent settings for things like IFCS decoupled, IFCS gravity compensation, etc. which can be set in the configuration MFD page. Those settings are persistently saved whenever you store your ship. However when you spawn a new ship in AC or when you got a replacement ship via insurance in the PU those settings are lost (because technically you have a new ship).
3.24.2 there introduces a new set of options for every persistent setting. When you as a player enter a ship seat for the first time (and only for the first time!), the game will copy your options to that seat. From there onwards things will be persistently saved again.
So if you spawn a ship and your friend enters a ship seat for the first time before you do it, the ship will use the default settings from your friend instead. Once the default settings have been set by anyone, they will not be automatically be changed anymore and need to tweaked manually via the configuration MFDs.
- New weapon grouping system + MFD page
Vehicle gunnery seats now come with a changed grouping system and access to a new weapon group configuration MFD page. Instead of having two fire buttons there is only one fire button, but up to four different groups for your guns. By default weapons are fired with LMB and you can iterate forward and backwards through your groups with the mouse wheel.
Weapon groups contain both guns and “non”-guns like EMP or QED devices.
By default all guns will be added to fire group 1 and after that split out by energy, ballistic and distortion guns sorted by projectile speed. Players are able to edit all gun weapon groups with the new weapon configuration MFDs.
For QED and EMP devices custom and un-editable weapon groups are created after the guns. Button bindings that have been added:
- fire weapon group
- iterate to next and previous weapon group (no overflow → you cannot switch from the last to the first group)
- iterate to next and previous weapon group (overflow → you can switch from the last to the first group )
- Short bindings to directly access every weapon group separately
- Precision Targeting & Mining Mode
Since precision targeting is now available in almost all operator modes (except salvage) the following default bindings change:
Toggle Laser Type is now on LALT+LMB
- Starmap Info UI Polish
Implemented hovered marker info panel to display condensed information about the marker hovered with the cursor. The primary marker info panel will now display the full information for only the selected marker, which will mean the panel information will never erroneously change when trying to interact with the set route button.

- Temporarily disabled cursor showing on elevator panels/supporting non-focused kiosk mode; now requires interaction mode to see a cursor on an elevator panel once again. This is temporary for the time being since we're missing some additional feature work to make it function properly on every terminal like ASOPs
**Ships and Vehicles**
- Misc Prospector MFD Polish
Removed top 2 prospector Displays. Made improvements to mining mode and MFD materials. Added grounding effects for radar and mining HUD. Fixed Extended Info Visibility based on Mining / Salvaging modes.
- Updated Vanduul MFD Color Palette to White to Help With Status Readability
- Balanced Heat for Ballistic Weapons

Weapons and Items
- Updated P8-AR recoil to smooth out some jarring sections of the recoil
- Tweaked 'oomph' of the P8-AR
- Normalized nvtc 4x to have similar benefits as the other 4x optics"
