# Features & Gameplay
Locations
- Hangar Cargo Platform Lighting Polish Pass (work in progress to increase lighting)
Gameplay
- UI Readability Improvement Polish
Made numerous updates to Holographic MFD visuals and other holographic elements to improve legibility. Improved legibility of Many HUD Elements. Scale down chromatic aberration on lower resolutions / factor in chromatic aberration options setting. Magnification hookup setting for Aiming Elements. Fixed TVI Opacity Logic. Crosshair Contextual weapon ammo counts. Aiming UI: Sized elements based on frustum ratio instead of absolute pixels but keep line widths and text sizes sized to pixels. Updated vehicle objective quad to be chevron instead. Added new AR geometry material, updated markers, and offscreen marker material. Updated contextual weapon info. Made further reticle visual improvements. Radar Visibility Polish: Shrink radar sphere of screen radar and increase/improve clarity of markers and other elements to compensate.
- Hangar Spawn Logic Updates
When retrieving ships into newly created persistent hangars, we now also check for existing vehicles and store them. Also, when despawning ships we wait for async response to the vehicle owner query - (else we'll destroy ships where that's not been received yet). This avoids ships clipping into each other after spawning them into non-empty persistent hangars.

- Improved Item Kiosk Camera Positioning

Adjusted the blue lights on the canopy to not be blinding (all hornets). Removed the canopy annuciators on the f7cm and added the new ones to the dashboad screens. Made general lighting tweaks inside the F7cm.

Reworked MFD and associated material to resemble those of other RSI ships. Moved MFDs up in order to be in view when player is looking straight ahead.
