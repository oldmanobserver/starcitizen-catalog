Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to Evocati, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9125941-9126995.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.

Server Info: US Only - EPTU Channel - PU Only (AC Disabled) - Replication Layer/Recovery Enabled
Long Term Persistence: Enabled

The current build is under NDA (Talking about features and testing is allowed but no sharing of game video, screenshots, audio, files, or accounts outside of Evocati)
Please log out then back in on the issue council site to see the Evocati environment there. Please make sure to only select the Evocati 3.23 environment when creating IC reports while the builds are Evocati only

# Features and Gameplay
Locations
- Overhauled Water
We have completely reworked the wave simulation and rendering of all water in Star Citizen in addition to creating a new multi-scale region-based water surface simulation system. Oceans and Water Volumes are now affected by all physical objects as well as forces from thruster and ship wake. Caustics are fully reworked to be both faster and driven by the dynamic results of the new water simulation. Underwater fog has been reworked to resolve various rendering issues, and the appearance of water when intersecting the camera has been vastly improved.

AI
- Full AI Ship Combat Balance Pass
With this update you should notice a difficulty increase in all AI piloted ships with multipliers being adjusted.

Gameplay
-     mobiGlas Rework
Reworking the mobiGlas system to use Building Blocks, which will also allow for easier development of mobiGlas apps. This update includes completely reworked overwall UI along with reworked Home, Starmap, Contract Manager, Mo trader, Niknax, Journal apps, and more.
-     Starmap Rework
Implementing the new and improved Starmap with improved visuals and usability, including easier search and trip planning functionality.
-     FPS Map System
Implementing a minimap for the HUD as well as interior maps for FPS gameplay, helping players stay oriented in close-quarter encounters.
-     Vehicle Targeting Keybind Updates
With 3.23 we are moving slightly towards the S42 scheme for targeting. This comes with a few keybind changes.
- T (short press): select target closest to crosshair and iterate forward (based on crosshair angle)
- T (long press): enable / disable auto targeting, it will pick the closest hostile in view (based on crosshair angle)
- R: Iterate subsystems (if available and target was scanned, based on angle from crosshair outwards)
- G: always swap gimbal mode
- E: turret gyro on / off
- LALT+R: disable subtargeting
- Added keybinds to magnify the aiming UI (none  set by default)
- 4: Target closest ship targeting you and iterate (based on distance)
- 5: Target closest hostile ship and iterate (based on distance)
- 6: Target closest friendly ship and iterate (based on distance)
- 7: Target closest contact and iterate from there (based on distance)
- LALT+B (short press): Set BOMB target
- Default binding for turret ESP has been removed but can still be assigned.
- Ping - Tab (Will be the same for FPS when it's ready)
- Scoreboard - F1 (Arena Commander)
- Made Further Physical Shopping UI and UX Improvements
