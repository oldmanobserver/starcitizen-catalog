# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.1
Alpha Patch 3.23.1 has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.1-PTU.9174453.
It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Open PTU
Server Info: PTU Channel - US Servers Only
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000


# Testing/Feedback Focus
3.23.1 is mostly Fleet Week related but includes some other fixes and updates that might not have made it in time for 3.23.0 LIVE.
Expo halls elevator issues have been resolved and halls will run with an accelerated timeframe shortly after this build is released.
- Stability/Performance/Bug Fixing
- Fleet Week Events and Rentals :slightly_smiling_face:


# Known Issues
For 3.23, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs. This is not the intended final outcome for missions and recovery and further changes are coming in a later release.
We are expecting ships purchased in game with aUEC right before 3.23.0 went live to come back with 3.23.1 when it goes LIVE.

# Features & Gameplay
- Medical Bed Respawn Update
With the release of 3.23.1, we wanted to provide players with a less brutal experience when getting back into action. To help with this, we are making all Medical Bed Tiers be capable of being set as a regen location. 
The range at which you will be able to respawn in them will depend on their size class. 
- T3 medical beds will allow respawning up to 20km away
- T2 medical beds (which previously allowed respawning up to 20km) will now allow respawning up to 50km away

These current values for respawn distance will be monitored for balance and will be adjusted if needed. Healing capabilities for all beds will remain the same and players respawning will do so without their equipment they dropped on death and will have to be prepared with extra stored or survive to go back and reloot their corpse.
