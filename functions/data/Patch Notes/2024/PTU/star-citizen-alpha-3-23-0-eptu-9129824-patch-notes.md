# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to Evocati, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9129824.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Evocati
Server Info: US Only - EPTU Channel - PU Only (AC Disabled) - Replication Layer/Recovery Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000

The current build is under NDA (Talking about features and testing is allowed but no sharing of game video, screenshots, audio, files, or accounts outside of Evocati)
Please log out then back in on the issue council site to see the Evocati environment there. Please make sure to only select the Evocati 3.23 environment when creating IC reports while the builds are Evocati only

***Please monitor etf-testing-chat in spectrum for updates and testing instruction*s.**

Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".
