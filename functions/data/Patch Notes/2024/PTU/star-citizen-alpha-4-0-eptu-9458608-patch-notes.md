# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 4.0
Alpha Patch 4.0 has been released to Wave 2 testers!  Patch should now show: VERSION 4.0.0-EPTU.9458608.

Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

# Features & Gameplay
- **Gameplay**
**Backpack and Armor Capacity Updates**
Increased Occupancy Volume for Backpacks to Prevent Backpack Inventory Nesting. Further Armor size updates to allow some items back into med/heavy armor such as water bottle and med gun.

- Implemented Health/Wear functionality on Fuses so Fuses Lose Health Over Time When Connected to a Contested Zone Door
- Updating Spawn Closets tags to ensure the correct NPCs spawn in the correct locations of a Frontier Outpost
- Adjusted the Jurisdiction of all outposts on the Starmap to make sure they show who respectfully owns it
- **Ships and Vehicles**
**Advanced HUD Polish**
- The speed limiter will now have a value of 100% by default
- The speed limiter will now show up in the MFD config screen
- The speed limiter value will not change between master modes anymore
- Fixed Velocity bar Behaviors
- Moved the speed and acceleration limiters to discrete mousewheel up / down actions instead of an axis. This also fixes accidently triggering weapon group changes when the limiters change.
- Unused speed actions (set to SCM, set to target speed) have been removed
- Binding names have slightly changed. If you use the limiters on your setup you might need to rebind them
- Moved Ship Alerts to Visor

**Additional Ship Updates**
- Added Missing Annunciator panel to Reliant, Nox, Mantis, Scout, Defender
- Added Mining HUD to Mole Pilot Seat
- Mining UI: Updated Mining Bars and Setup With ARGO Style
- Crusader Intrepid: Adjusted exterior proxies that were clipping into the cargo bay, stopping tractor beams from working (Should fix STARC-139944)
- **Core Tech**
**Personal Instanced Hangar Spawning**
Tonight's build will further test instanced hangar spawning in all shards. This will allow players who have completed (or skipped) the NPE mission to get faster into space; spawning in their own property. This is not a temporary change to avoid transit. You will also not spawn in rental hangars, so if you park in a different LZ or station you will wake up in a Hab.

- Further Network and Interaction Delay Improvements
- Physics Performance Optimizations
- Entity Cleanup Optimizations
- Spawn Closet and Fauna Performance Optimizations
- Jump Tunnel: Performance Optimizations to Reduce Stalls. Audio Mixing Polish
