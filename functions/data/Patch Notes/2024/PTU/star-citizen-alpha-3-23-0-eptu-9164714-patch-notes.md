# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.0
Alpha Patch 3.23.0 has been released to EPTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.0-EPTU.9164714.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\EPTU. 

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Audience: Open PTU
Server Info: US/EU - EPTU Channel
Replication Layer: Enabled
Server Recovery: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 15,000,000


**Testing/Feedback Focus**
-     Stability/Performance/Bug Fixing
-     New Features & Gameplay Updates

**Known Issues**
For 3.23.0 LIVE, Server Crash Recovery will remove all current missions and mark them as abandoned. This will not reduce reputation when this occurs. This could cause a few trespassing issues in locations like UGFs. This is not the intended final outcome for missions and recovery and further changes are coming in a later release.

# Bug Fixes
This build has many streaming changes around Distribution Centers to help stop ships and vehicles falling through and clipping the floors and ground in the area after the locations stream out and back in. With this update, Distribution Centers should stream in before vehicles allowing them to determine position correctly. This issue was causing large amounts of physics performance costs on the servers and reducing their overall framerates. 
-     Fixed - PU - Stanton - Port Tressler - Transit - Elevators at Port Tressler may become unusable
-     Fixed - PU - Missions / AI - AI are desyncing during combat inside UGFs (Should hopefully resolve AI teleport jitter)
-     Fixed - PU - Stanton - Actor - Interactions - Consumables - Unable to drink full bottle contents in one nonstop action

# Technical
-     Fixed 3 Server Crashes
