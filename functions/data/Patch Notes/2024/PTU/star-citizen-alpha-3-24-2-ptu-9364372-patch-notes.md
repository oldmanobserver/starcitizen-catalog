# Features & Gameplay
**Gameplay**
- Quantum Travel Polish
We have made large adjustments to Quantum Travel speeds, accelerations, fuel storage, use, and prices in 3.24.2 that will help balance movement around the PU. Ship fuel take sizes have been balanced across all ships to adjust for archetype with some getting less fuel and others being able to hold more. Quantum Drives have all been adjusted for fuel use, speed, and acceleration to balance ship travel based on shorter and longer distance archetypes. Cooldown times have not been adjusted.

**Ships and Vehicles**
- Cannon Max Ammo and Regen Balance Pass
All sizes of cannons have had their regen rate and held ammo count reduced to balance against repeaters.
- Modified the default Ship Power distribution to allocate full power to most pools, but less to triangle pools
- Zeus Art, Lighting, and Interactions Polish Pass
- MFD Polish: Added support for multiple pips connected together
- Greatly Increased Ship Turret Health Pools
- Reduced A2/C2 Held Countermeasures
- Added new Textures / Materials to Holographic MFDs
- Improved Prospector Radar Grounding effects
**Weapons and Items**

Slightly increased visual recoil. Adjusted recoil over time min start value from 0.5 to 0.75. Increased Horizontal aim recoil per shot from 0.033 to 0.05. Increased Vertical aim recoil per shot from 0.26 to 0.345.
