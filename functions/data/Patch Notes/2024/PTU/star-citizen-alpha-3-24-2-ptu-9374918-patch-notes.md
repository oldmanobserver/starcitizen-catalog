# Features & Gameplay
Ships and Vehicles
- MFD/Hud Polish and Marker Decluttering
We've made lots of adjustments to how much information is displayed directly in view with a large de-cluttering pass on markers.
A set amount of on screen markers are now considered "Essential", meaning that they are always on display (this includes essential items such as hostile/locked/pinned/selected targets, objectives, navpoints, assigned hangars/landing areas, and party markers within distance). Non-essential markers will be hidden by default. This only affects on screen markers and the radar will still display essential and non-essential items. This is a large step in making sure relevant information is clear in your view. To see non-essential markers around you with out the radar, you will need to use the ship ping (TAB default for keyboard players)

Along with this we've made further marker performance optimizations. Separated materials for starmap, holo radar, and screen radar to allow adjustments per context. Removed all edge markers from radar and fixing issues with determining whether a marker is within the volume on screen radars. Added stroke to Unpowered pips, and fix percent rounding wrapping of last pip.
- Removed gimbals from non weapon turrets (Ships updated: Argo Mole, CNOU Nomad, Drake Caterpillar, MISC Prospector, ORIG 315P, RSI Constellation Taurus)
- Tweaked weapons pool sizes and added engineering buffs to some vehicles to fix weapon power deficits
- Added New Ships to Shops: Mirai Pulse, RSI Ursa Medivac, ARGO MPUV-1T, Aegis Sabre Firebird
- Retaliator Modules Added in Component Shops
- Ground Vehicle Emission rebalance
- Legibility HUD/MFD Pass on BANU Defender and MISC Ships
