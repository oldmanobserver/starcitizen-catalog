# Features & Gameplay
Gameplay
- Tractor Beam Use Adjustments
Tractor Beam use on the multi-tool has had its cargo mass balanced to restrict use to cargo sizes under 32 SCU (multi-tool can no-longer move 32 SCU crates) and to reduce usable distance. Both handheld tractor beams have had their movement speeds reduced.
- Item Bank UI Changes
Based on feedback we determined the Storage Access flow was not providing the results we wanted. We've thus changed it to open a filtered view of the Warehouse inventory to only show FPS gear, like the Storage Access kiosk did. Search is missing in that view and will be added in a future patch. Fortunately, the Storage Access screen shares a lot of functionality with the Freight Elevator Kiosk, so it wasn't throw-away work.
- Cargo Hauling Mission Changes
Greatly Increased Cargo Hauling Mission Rewards. Allowed players to retrieve cargo for shared missions where they aren't the original mission owner. Set Hauling Intro missions to not be shareable.

Ships and Vehicles
- Removed SDFs and Shields from Spindles and Attached Cargo of the Hull-C

Core Tech
- Made Further Ship Debris Collision Physics Performance Improvements
- Entity Count Performance Polish for Hurston
