Long Term Persistence: Enabled 
Server Meshing: Enabled
Mesh Configuration: 2:2:380 (2 solar systems, 2 servers per system, 380 players total per mesh)

Note: This patch does not contain all of the intended features, which will be added iteratively to the notes as they become available. Additionally, some features may be implemented in a partial state and as such are not ready for testing.  When those features reach a playable state they will be detailed on the notes and added to the "Testing Focus".  Please issue council all issues related to those in testing focus and in general gameplay.

# Features & Gameplay

-     Gameplay
**FOIP Tracking Refinements**
Various improvements to the tracking stability and quality of Face-Over-IP. Added Head rotation tracking. Refined tracking algorithm. Improved motion with wider range of motion for the mouth. Stabilization to help jitter in low light and high light conditions. Secondary motions added for extreme poses.

**Made Further Mission Refactor Progress**
More missions will be available but still very much work in progress. This will also disable the Service Beacons tab for the initial 4.0 release but will not affect medical beacon use. Added auto pagination to Contracts. For 4.0, many missions will be very localized, some down to the exact point of interest you are at.

- Split objectives in contract panel based on whether they are in the player's solar system or not, for displaying distances and sorting

-     Ships and Vehicles
**Further Ship Inclusions**
Added further inclusions from 3.24.3 into 4.0 for Starlancer/Polaris/Intrepid/Terrapin/Terapin Medic

**Carrack Feature Updates**
The Carrack has has been updated to include the option to deploy and undeploy its blast shield through a new interaction added to the cockpit. We have also added a new interaction to open and close the cargo pods for outside access to load cargo in and out of the ship. This currently keeps the cargo pods in their current raised state near the ship and does not have all the intended audio.
