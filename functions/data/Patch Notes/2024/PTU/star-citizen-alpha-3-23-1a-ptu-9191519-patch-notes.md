# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.23.1a
Alpha Patch 3.23.1a has been released to PTU, and is now available to test!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.23.1-PTU.9191519.
It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER folder for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\PTU. 

At this time, this update does not contain data that requires a new environment and we are working to keep it that way until it is released to LIVE. Players should not lose items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs when the build is released to LIVE.
