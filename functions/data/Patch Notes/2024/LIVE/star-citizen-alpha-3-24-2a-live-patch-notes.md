# Star Citizen Alpha Patch 3.24.2a
Alpha Patch 3.24.2a has now been released onto the LIVE Environment! Patch should now show: VERSION 3.24.2-LIVE.9402394.

Characters in this new environment have been built from Long Term Persistence(LTP) data.
Currently with LTP, certain player states such as personal hangar layout, custom characters, and in-game purchased consumables are not saved between releases which will cause some items to be lost in the next update.

Items not saved to LTP Include:
    Hangar Decoration Customizations (Decorations will be returned to player's home location inventory)
    Medpens, Ammo, Ongoing Rentals and Refinery Jobs, and Character Customization (Make sure to Export your Custom Character)


3.24.2a combines all the current hotfixes on LIVE along with many new stability and bug fixes
