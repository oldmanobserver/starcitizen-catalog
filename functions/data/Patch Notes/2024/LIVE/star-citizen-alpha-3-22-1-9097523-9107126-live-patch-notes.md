# Star Citizen Patch 3.22.1
Alpha Patch 3.22.1 has been released and is now available to test on the LIVE Environment!   Patch should now show: VERSION 3.22.1-LIVE.9097523-9107126.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER and Shader folders for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE. The Shader folders can be found here %localappdata%\Star Citizen.

Characters in this new environment will be built from LTP data so items such as medpens, ammo, rentals, and refinery jobs will be lost.
Long Term Persistence: Enabled
Starting aUEC: 20,000

# New Features
Ships and Vehicles
- Added New Ship: Anvil F7C Hornet Mk II
# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Gravlev Balance Updates
Updated acceleration restrictions to gravlev player height changes. Full Balance Pass for performance changes for all gravlev vehicles.
-     Distortion Temporary Changes
Distortion damage has been effectively removed from all item except power plants and dashboards. This is a temporary measure until we rework how distortion damage penetrates vehicle hulls. Shields now have a 75% to 95% resistance against distortion weapons (based on power triangle assignment).

-     Added a mild push impulse force on catastrophic shatter of mineables (with a smaller force for FPS variants)
