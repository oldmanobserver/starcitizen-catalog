# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Initial Ship Delivery
This change we are making affects how you obtain your vehicle when logging into the game for the first time after a database reset. Instead of being immediately entitled to your home location in-game, ship pledges on our website will now be available at any ASOP terminal labeled as "Deliverable". You can make your ship available at the location for the first time by pressing the "Deliver" button, which functions similarly to the standard insurance claim but is free and only takes about 20 seconds. Once delivered that ship will be available to customize and be used. This change will help address entitlement database spam when new accounts are entering the PU for for the first time. This delivery feature reduces the size of player's default inventories and thus the size of the global databases substantially.
-     Arena Commander Customization Temporarily Disabled
We have implemented improvements to the API that manages ship customization in Arena Commander and are exploring more, which we believe will further alleviate issues with entitlement. While these changes are being tested, ship customization in Arena Commander will be temporarily disabled for 3.18.1. You will still be able to select ships from your hangar as well as REC rentals, however. We will be providing several vehicle loadout changes in AC that you can use in the meantime with upgraded shield generators and weaponry that we've hand selected. This will temporarily update the loadouts of the base Gladius, Arrow, and Blade. This change will be temporary; customization will be reenabled in the following update. The next update will also include general fixes that didn't make it for 3.18.1's release and/or were blocked by issues with Persistent Entity Streaming.
-     Density Manager Optimizations
Updated Density Manager values to be more aggressive for removing unneeded entities in the PU to improve server/client performance.
-     Made additional optimizations for loot generation

# Bug Fixes
-     Players crashing out/quits mid using an ASOP terminal should no longer brick it and make it unusable
-     Players should now be able to pick-up/interact with repair drops in Arena Commander
-     Fixed an issue causing players to occasionally be unable to exit ship seats
-     Gas clouds should no longer cause a memory leak
-     Fixed Various issues in Arena Commander where the waiting for players count would fall below 0 which would cause the match to never start

# Technical
In 3.18.1 we have made many dramatic changes to how the ASOP, client, server, and global databases handle entities and entitlements which should help both make things like stowing and unstowing of ships more reliable and snappier as well as address many of the various issues players have been seeing with unstowed characters and many different account errors blocking players from loading into the PU.
The 3.18 infrastructure needs are a lot higher than previous game versions. Armed with data of the last few weeks of 3.18 the team has also spent considerable amount of time analyze and optimize the cloud footprint of the game, resizing and adjusting layout of the clusters and regions where the game hosts services.

-     Fixed 2 Client Crashes
-     Fixed 2 Server Crashes
