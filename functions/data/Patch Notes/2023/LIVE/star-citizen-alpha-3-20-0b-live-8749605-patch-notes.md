Core Tech
-     Localization Support
We’ve recreated functionality for our community localization volunteers to build and use their own translations via a localized global.ini file. Instruction on how and where to insert the file into your Star Citizen directories are below.  
 
**Technical Steps:**
For our community localization volunteers: We now will allow a localized global.ini file to be used for translations and supported by a variety of new fonts. Instructions on how and where to insert translation files into your Star Citizen directories are below.  
1. Create a new folder in the following directory: \StarCitizen\LIVE\data\Localization\New Folder 
2. Rename the folder to one of the following: 
-     chinese_(simplified)  
-     chinese_(traditional) 
-     english 
-     french_(france) 
-     german_(germany) 
-     italian_(italy) 
-     japanese_(japan) 
-     korean_(south_korea)  
-     polish_(poland) 
-     portuguese_(brazil) 
-     spanish_(latin_america) 
-     spanish_(spain 
     
3. Put your previously translated global.ini file into the new folder.  
4. Add one line from below of CVAR into your “user.cfg” file in your \StarCitizen\LIVE folder
-      g_language = chinese_(simplified)  
-      g_language = chinese_(traditional)  
-      g_language = english  
-      g_language = french_(france)  
-      g_language = german_(germany)  
-      g_language = italian_(italy)  
-      g_language = japanese_(japan)  
-      g_language = korean_(south_korea)  
-      g_language = polish_(poland)  
-      g_language = portuguese_(brazil)  
-      g_language = spanish_(latin_america)  
-      g_language = spanish_(spain)  
5. Launch the game as normal and the localization should work.
