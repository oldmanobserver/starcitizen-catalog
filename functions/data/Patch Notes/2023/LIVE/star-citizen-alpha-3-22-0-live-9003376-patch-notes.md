# New Features
Locations
- Additional Derelict Settlements
Inclusion of 15 new Derelict Settlements with both mission gameplay, social elements, and shops. These new inhabited settlements are spread throughout the wildernesses of Hurston and microTech using the Rastar tool with a larger, expanded library of new and existing assets. Some locations are accessible via the Starmap while other new settlements are more discrete and appear behind missions. All NPCs at these locations are neutral, making up a population of independent civilians and members of the Dusters faction and have been updated to use the new hair tech and faction clothing.

New Hurston Locations Include: Zephyr, Maker’s Point, Ludlow, Pickers Field, Finn’s Folly, Weeping Cove, Cutter’s Rig, and Rappel.
New MicroTech Locations Include: Frostbite, Razor’s Edge, Bloodshot Ridge, Harper’s Point, Astor’s Clearing, Moreland Hills, and Dunboro.


Gameplay
- Salvage: Structural
Implementing the ability to transform large chunks of metal salvaged from ships into a refinable material. 

Structural salvage is the next step in the salvage profession. Initially, It will bring additional functionality to the two salvage ships, The DRAKE Vulture and AEGIS Reclaimer. It will allow players to convert full ships into the resources RMC and Construction Components that can be sold or used to craft multiple items using the filler station. It will also bring an update to the way material is stored on the salvage ships. It will introduce the concept of “internal storage” which is a buffer in the ship that will fill. This buffer storage size will depend on the size of the salvaging ship with the Reclaimer getting a 240 SCU buffer while the Vulture receives a 13 SCU buffer. Once full, the buffer storage needs to be emptied using the filler station. For Reclaimer owners, the salvage mode is only operable from the co-pilot seat. The Reclaimer salvage terminal can now export size 1, 2, 8, and 16 SCU cargo containers.

Salvage Functionality is now split into multiple segments after entering Salvaging Mode (Default Keybind: M):
Hull Scraping (Default Keybind: G): The Current Salvage System to remove the hull from ships. If the Hull is not scraped off the material is lost in the process when moving onto steps 2-3.
Fracturing Mode (Default Keybind: RightAlt+W): This mode will break up intact ships or derelicts into smaller pieces
Disintegration (Default Keybind: RightAlt+S): This mode will generate the resource from the broken down pieces

To start Fracturing Mode on a ship, point to the ship you want to fracture and enter Fracturing mode. Once fracture mode has been started, the ship will then break apart in a certain period of time based on the size of the ship. 

To Start Disintegration Mode, point to the newly fragmented parts of a ship and engage the Disintegration mode to break apart the chunks and collect them into the salvage buffer storage of your ship. Fracture/Disintegration field salvage speed is linearly proportional base on position and distances.

Once the salvage material fills the buffer storage, have the filler station fill a commodity box and move to the ship's cargo grid.

- Inventory: Openable Cargo Containers
3.22 adds openable cargo containers, allowing players to be able to store commodities and items in. These new 1, 2, 4, and 8 SCU containers can be purchased and sold through shops and dropped from your location inventory into your ship cargo grid. These new cargo containers allow contents to be sold individually, as well as the containers themselves, in which case any unsold contents will be sent to the inventory the container is being held in.

This also includes work for tractor beams that will make it so cargo is locked onto cargo grids when the ship is locked by the door integrity. Meaning as long as the integrity is sufficient, cargo cannot be removed from cargo grids except by the owner or party members. It is considered a law infraction if Stolen off a cargo grid in a Monitored Zone.
