# Star Citizen Patch 3.20.0a
Alpha Patch 3.20.0 has been released and is now available on the LIVE environment! Patch should now show: VERSION 3.20.0-LIVE.8717119.

It is strongly recommended that players delete their USER and Shader folders for the Public client after patching, particularly if you start encountering any odd character graphical issues or crash on loading. The USER folder can be found (in default installations) at C:\Program Files\Roberts Space Industries\StarCitizen\LIVE. The Shader folders can be found here %localappdata%\Star Citizen.


Short Term Database Reset: Yes (Loss of items not stored in LTP)
Long Term Persistence (LTP): Enabled
Starting aUEC: 20,000

**Known Issues**
- Crash  - Client - PU - Crash to desktop when transferring items from station location inventory to ship inventory using Shift + Left Click

Workarounds: First, If the Hull-C has cargo as part of the end of the flow, try and request detach via the Cargo center rather than regular ATC. Second, if the Hull-C doesn't have cargo, make sure the spindles are collapsed then store, retrieve again, and request via regular ATC on mG comms.
