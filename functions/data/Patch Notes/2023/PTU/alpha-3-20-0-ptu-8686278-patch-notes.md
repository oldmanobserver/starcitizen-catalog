# New Features

Gameplay
-     Added Combat Logging Timer
Along with 3.20, we have added a new Combat Logging mechanic to avoid as much of this issue as possible. With this updated mechanic, while a player is in combat and outside of a green zone, the player and their ship will remain in the PU for a short period after exiting the game fully or to the menu. This also comes with a warning while exiting to menu to make sure you are in a safe area before leaving as it will leave your ship and character vulnerable at the location they left the server.
-     Added Option To Allow Comms Calls from Only Friends

# Feature Updates
Ships and Vehicles
-     Ship Quantum HUD Alignment
We have done a full pass on all ships to make sure all the Quantum HUDs have been properly aligned in view. Along with this, much of the Quantum UI has been removed to be much cleaner and remove unnecessary elements until a full, future quantum HUD update. As this is different for all ships, if you see any that you believe are not quite right still, let us know in the IC!
-     Argo MOLE Pilot Improvement
Added the ability for the Pilot in the Argo MOLE to use the ships mining scanners. This will not allow the pilot to use the lasers from the seat but will give the pilot the much needed information directly while scanning mineables.
-     Greatly increased the internal storage of the Drake Corsair
