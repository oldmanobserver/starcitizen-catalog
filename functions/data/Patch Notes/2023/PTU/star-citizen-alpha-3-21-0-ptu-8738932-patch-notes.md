# New Features

Locations
- New Jump Point Rest Stop Stations and Lagrange Points
Addition of 3 additional Rest Stops to Stanton that act as the final stop before entering Jump Points. Each location is set up similarly to all the other Lagrange Points and consists of a parent Gas Cloud, a smaller Child Gas Cloud, a Gateway Rest Stop and and structures leading to the Jump Point itself. It is important to note that Jump Points are currently non-functional in 3.21 as Stanton is the only available system at this time and right now.

These 3 new Stations with Jump Points that leave the Stanton System are: 
- Pyro Gateway - (Stanton>Pyro)
- Magnus Gateway - (Stanton>Magnus)
- Terra Gateway - (Stanton>Terra)
