# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     ASOP Technical Refactor
With 3.19.1 comes a technical refactor to ASOPs. While this is a mostly transparent update under the hood, it does have a few key directly observable advantages and fixes.

Key changes for this refactor are the removal of waiting for ship spawning. Ship delivery time is now 0 by default. Optimized the update of on screen information by not having to re-query the list after a ship's state changed. Fixed multiple buttons being displayed on top of each others. Fixed bad ship states when opening the terminal while having pending queries. Removal of ATC location assignment delays. Removed static delay when calling ATC. Fixed impounding fees that were not being applied. Fixed ATC getting stuck in a bad state upon a failed unstow request and handling of ASOP screen when unstow fails. Prevent multiple spawns in ASOP so players cannot accidentally spawn the same ship twice causing the previous ones to become impounded. Speed up fade when accessing ASOP. Fixed "unknown" state after a ship was stored while looking at the terminal, giving the "claim" button. Fixed wrong selected ship index when moving the mouse after having pressed a button. Adjusted alpha of disabled button state on the ASOP. Change "Transferring to Storage" with "Moving to Storage" as the string was 1 character too long and the first word was split on the UI. Added time remaining to the ASOP status column when a ship is being delivered. Fixed multiple ship highlight selection when moving cursor fast over the vehicle list. Fixed red message showing up at random times indicating an error.


# Bug Fixes
-     Fixed - ASOP / Fleet Manager / UI - ASOP Terminals are unusable and fade to black when accessed
-     Fixed - Missions - Eliminate All / Caterpillar Crashsites - Additional FPS AI spawning after planet is streamed out and in
