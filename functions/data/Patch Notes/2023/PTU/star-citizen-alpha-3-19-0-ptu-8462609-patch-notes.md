# New Features
Gameplay
- New Player Experience
An initiative for improving the initial (first 30 minutes) gameplay experience, which will help players understand the context of the world and introduce them to some of Star Citizen's basic features. This update focuses on the experience in Area 18 and Baijini Point. As players enter the main menu to join the universe they will be prompted with the option to join as normal or accept the New Player Experience Mission chain which will set their spawn to Area18 and begining a walkthrough. Being the NPE we are going to leave the details off to give you all the experience of doing this as close to a new player as possible without information.


# Feature Updates
Locations
- Lorville LOD, Collision, and Lighting Polish Pass
- ArcCorp Atmosphere and Planetary Metalic Gloss Polish Pass

Gameplay
- Mining Balancing v01
With 3.19 comes updates to both Ship and FPS mining with wide-sweeping balance changes to sell prices, refining effectiveness and costs, component stats, multi-crew mining efficiency, mineable difficulties and masses with larger asteroids, resource distribution, as well as the addition of new mineables. The goal in 3.19 is to make multi-crew mining more attractive and even out all materials to make them all more lucrative instead of a select few.

**Ship mining**
Resource Distribution has been updated to reflect a more distinct distribution of minerals throughout Stanton. Which means that several locations (per planet/moon) now hold exclusive resources rather, than full random resources. Additionally we defined so called “standard” resources that are a given in each minable you will encounter. The rest of the elements have chances to appear in those rocks. The updated resource distribution is also reflected in the trading availability and refining capabilities. Every mining gadget, head, and sub item has had a full balance pass for stats, cost, and efficiencies. Every item that is connected to mining gameplay loop was updated to target specific resources to be mined better or worse depending on the setup of your Mining Head. Multi-crew mining has also been balanced with the Mole getting a buff on instability if the same lasers fire on the same rock, while the Prospector will get a punishment for multiple prospectors firing at the same rock on instability.

**FPS mining**
A new minable is introduced that is only available in the new caves systems and has a high value to encourage players to go mining with their FPS tools outside of prison.

**Changes in the Mining Update**

- Resource Update
Concept of minable rarities for resources:
Standard (base resource of a minable always part of any rock, like Iron
Common (chance to be part of the rock like beryl)
Uncommon (chance to be part of the rock like Gold)
Rare (chance to be part of the rock like Qunatainium)
Dedicated location for resources that have the standard rarity (like Arial having Iron and Quartz)
Updated properties for resources (each resource should affect the properties of the rock based on their amount)
Updated mass for minables (resource composition affects the mass of the rock
More variant rock sizes/masses
Small ones that do not need breaking to massive rocks that require multiple players)
Additional rock types with unique chances for resource compositions
removed Diamonds temporarily
- FPS Mining Update
Added Janalite as FPS minable to caves (very rare but very valuable)
- Resource Refining and prices
Updated resource prices and demands at TDDs
The further away from the standard material the more profit
Updated refinery yield and time for certain material to encourage longer distances to travel for the best money/hour
- Full item rework
Mining heads now have a min/max laser power
Mining heads have different laser power per size
Mining heads have different extraction speeds where there is also a difference between S1 and S2
Mining heads have different ideal distances
Updated resistance values for all mining items
Updated instability mitigating values for all mining items
Unified properties for all Mining modules and Mining Gadgets
Buffed Active modules drastically
Added new property exclusive to mining gadgets: Called Cluster modifier that clusters element together à if you split a rock it increases the chance that the elements are together in one of the broken pieces)
Filtering on some items that remove the inert from the rocks you are collecting
Sub item slots on Mining Heads are different between S1 and S2
Resistance reduction now is multiplicative
Made Instability updates
- UI Update
Difficulty forecast that tells you how easy it is to break the rock you are facing
Reordered some elements of the UI
Details of the mining items you have currently equipped
Details on your current cargo
Clearer scanning display and clearer explanation what is happening during scanning
- Synergy Tractor Beam
Allow to detach attach Mining modules/ Heads/ sacks
