**Testing Focus**
This evening, we plan to run a stress test on the PTU for Star Citizen Alpha 3.18. This is a critical step in our journey towards hopefully opening the PTU to all backers over the weekend, and we'd love your help! Your involvement and feedback have been a MASSIVE help thus far. That's why we are kindly asking for all hands on deck to hammer the PTU this evening. We're in the home stretch, and your participation will help us get this one out the door.

The stress test will kick off at 3 PM Pacific / 2300 UTC and run for 2 hours. We encourage all Wave 2 testers to join in and put the servers through their paces. The more players we have online, the more effectively we can simulate the live release conditions and identify any potential issues before truly opening the flood gates on PTU, followed by a swift launch to the live servers.

During the stress test, we will be monitoring the servers, performance, and stability, and gathering feedback from the community. Your bug reports, feedback, and suggestions are incredibly valuable to us and will play a crucial role in the final stages of launch.
