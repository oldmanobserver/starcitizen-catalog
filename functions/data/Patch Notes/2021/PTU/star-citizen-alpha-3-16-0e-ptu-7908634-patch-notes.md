# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Gravlev Polish Pass
Increased gravlev bike speeds. Updated so that bikes should not get flung up into the air nearly as much when touching geometry such as rocks or buildings. Bikes should now behave much smoother when levitating quickly over meshes such as rocks, plants, ect. Bikes should no longer be able to hover on the side of walls (and get pushed away from them). Bouncing and oscillating in certain places should no longer occur. Speed limiter no longer affects height control. Height control no longer causes the bike to oscillate or shake. Bikes should no longer be flung into the air when disembarking. Bikes should not be randomly or unfairly damaged or explode anymore.

Weapons and Items
-     Mounted Guns Polish
Tweaked mounted guns to be more in line as an infantry suppression weapon. This will reduce projectile velocity and RPM, reduce projectile damage per hit, reduce projectile weight (this will reduce force reactions on players), as well as giving projectiles a higher spread. Greatly increased how long players can fire the weapon before it shuts down.

Core Tech
-     Added 'service unavailable' message when the service request for searching friends fails

-     Fixed further issues with Bounty hunter missions stalling indefinitely if leaving the area before it updates on a slow server
-     Exiting Gravlev vehicles should no longer cause it to fling you into the air
-     Fixed an issue causing bikes to oscillate up and down on their own
-     Social AI should no longer have difficulty navigating past the archway asset at the Area18 hospital entrance
-     ReplaceMe textures should no longer be seen on the base of various exterior art assets of jumptown locations
-     Fixed an issue causing the Emergency Elevators to not send a valid player to the hospital once the Admit Patients UI has been activated
-     Area18 Hospital pharmacy kiosks should now populate with items for purchasing
-     Players should no longer become trapped on collision surrounding the vending machines in the lobby of the Empire Health Services hospital in Area18
