**Testing Focus**
Personal inventory is still undergoing UI changes as we progress through PTU and a feedback thread will be opened at a later time
-     Healing and Actor Status
-     Hospitals
-     Starlifter Hercules A2
-     Bombs
-     Infiltrate and Defend Missions
-     Loot Generation
-     Orison V2
-     Arena Commander Revamp
**Known Issues**
New Babbage commons is missing many assets and the bridge to connect domes. This will make locations there not accessible so you may want to avoid this area for now.
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu
Players will need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error. This is part of the bug where players used to see a Bad Token after a crash which blocked them from re-entering but with the latest changes, that error is no longer displayed.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.

-     There is a small area with no gravity in the airlock to the Grim Hex Medical facility
-     When requipping items from a loot box in zero-g, equipping the torso and arms will cause large amounts of inventory camera shaking
-     Weapon projectiles trajectory will not behave correctly when shooting from one zone inside a ship to another outside

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Inventory Polish Pass
Further style and performance tweaks have been made for all aspects of the inventory system. Updated filter system to display tabs showing quick item type sorting along with the original option for more granular filtering. Implemented new interaction dots and numbered ports for consumables (magazines, grenades, medpens). Added capacity display for consumables (magazines, grenades, medpens) on the item and as dots around the item port the item is attached to. Added double click to equip items from inventory. This should swap currently equipped gear and for consumables (magazines, grenades, medpens) should fill empty armor slots instead. Added Swap option to item contextual menu to remove the currently equipped item and replace with another. Updated the inventory to not display if the inventory they have open moves far enough away. Added capacity value the description tooltip of items that have storage space such as backpacks and chest/leg armors. Updated inventory page arrow buttons to be a bit clearer. Added interaction option to close world loot containers.
-     Law System Updates
Updated most crimestat 1 crimes to be misdemeanors which will still grant the same crimestat but can now be paid off at a fine terminal to remove. (note, the stations will still shoot at you with a CS1) Not paying off a crime at a terminal will escalate the fine and CS impact after a week. Reduced the cooldown between crimes for assaults so they will impact your crimestat more if they happen in succession. Greatly increased the crime stat contribution for all misdemeanors so that fines are much more important to pay off.
-     Downed State Polish Pass
Updated downed UI to be clearly visible while downed. Increased revival service beacon reward to 15k, up from 10k credits.
-     Healing and Medical Polish Pass
Disabled tractor beaming, healing, and drugging of other players in greenzones. Drug efficacy balance pass, and adjusted effects of Resurgera to be equally more aggressive towards BDL decay and other drugs' durations.
-     TVI QOL Updates 
Added options to have velocity indicator: Always on, fading (defualt), or always off.
-     Body Dragging Polish
Made some teaks to body dragging to make it behave more consistent and less jittery.
-     Made intro and rehire UGF missions shareable
-     Added a small reputation penalty for failing or abandoning a delivery intro or re-hire mission
Ships and Vehicles
-     400i Polish Pass
400i landing gear reverted back to it's previous, lower state. Door panel updates: new UI, removing light buttons where not needed & labeling locations.
