**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu. Players may need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error.
-     Players cannot repair, refuel, and rearm at outposts
-     Items not stored in long term persistence such as mined gems are currently not stackable (This is something that will be coming in a future update)
-     Tree density update is currently not in this initial 3.15.1 build (Will be updated in a later 3.15.1 build)
-     After trying on clothing in a store, all equipped items are permanently deleted from the inventory
-     Swapping weapons has a chance to drop or remove weapons
-     The Prospector door and ladder lack animations
-     When in combat, NPCs can get stuck in cover when trying to exit
-     Announcer audio callout for "Match over. You have won/lost the match" can be heard multiple times at the end of a round in Arena Commander
