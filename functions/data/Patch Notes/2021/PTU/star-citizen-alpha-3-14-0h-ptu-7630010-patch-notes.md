Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Testing Focus**
-     Crusader
-     Orison Landing Zone
-     Constellation Taurus
-     Law System v2: Surrender
-     Power Management v2 (Capacitor Gameplay)
-     Missile Operator Mode
-     Radar, Scanning, and Ping T0
**Known Issues**
-     Gas Clouds on Crusader appear to have moving graphical artifacts that appear as dots. Current clouds are still in development and not final. See note at the top of patch notes.
-     Orison objects & textures loading very slowly
-     XXL Hangars in Orison Dunlow Space Port are exhibiting invisible ceiling collision when ships try to disembark, even after hangar doors are fully retracted
-     Missiles do not follow flares as a countermeasure
-     Single location will only appear if the player spools their drive before setting destination on the starmap (Workaround: Spool quantum drive before opening the starmap and then open it and set route)
-     Various UI markers are faded and hard to read
-     Unable to scan for FPS or ROC-sized mining deposits until very close
-     Large black cubes and bright light particles can been seen within the snow storm clouds on microTech & in the "dust" storm on Hurston
-     Security Ships do not recognise illegal goods onboard a ship when being carried by a player
-     Players can clip through the exterior door of the 890 Jump whilst it is docked
-     The Player is unable to QT in Succession without Toggling the QT Drive off/on again
-     Landing gear proxies are missing on certain ships
-     Docked vehicles have misplaced collisions
-     Port Tressler is missing QT marker when Player returns to microTech planet
# Feature Updates
Locations
-     Orison Polish Pass
Added new rolling physics to the orison leaves. Did multiple lighting and performance optimization passes to various areas of Orison landing zone.

Gameplay
-     Ongoing Ship Capacitor, Balance, and Polish Pass
We have done further core tuning for ships. S1 to S4 ballistic repeaters and gatlings have been retuned to be extremely powerful but very low on ammo. Changed Caterpillar turrets to repeaters. Decrease weapon regen delay for every energy weapon. Reduced EMP damage. Removed inactive, powered off weapons from convergence calculations. Increased Terrapin hull HP. Increased health of Constellation and variants for various multiple parts.  Slightly decreased health of S1 shields.  Increased health and regen of S2 shields. Reduced p52 and p72 health. Reduced Arrow hull and nose slightly health. Streamlined HP on Reliant. Swapped default loadout of F7C with laser repeaters instead of ballistic gatling due to low ammo. Reduced delays on S3 and S4 shield generators.

Note on the ballistic change:  Small ship ballistics now have much more limited ammo but significant damage.  They are meant to be used sparingly, carefully, and may not be well suited for drawn out engagements but are very powerful if well timed. 
-     Law System Armistice Updates
Removed missile dumb fire as a crime in armistice zones. Change the Armistice Zone trigger from any hit to hits over the friendly fire threshold.
-     Updated initial default zoom position when opening the Starmap
-     Locked ping controls to scanning mode
-     Added menu option for increasing missile count to loop or not loop
-     Updated IFCS landing dust minimum angles for the directional effect
-     Added Game settings option to lock ping controls to scan mode
Ships and Vehicles
-     Change the default power plant on the F7C-S Hornet Ghost
-     Slightly widened and softened the aurora entrance proxies to help with placing objects inside
-     Updated lighting for the Constellation cockpits
-     Added new emerald tint for the constellation emerald
