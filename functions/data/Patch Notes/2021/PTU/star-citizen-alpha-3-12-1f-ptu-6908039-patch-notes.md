# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Increased inventory and refresh rate of all shop items to reduce the frequency that items run out of stock
-     Increased the availability of prison repair missions
-     Made further optimizations to help with AI flight movement when server framerate is erratic
-     Xenothreat mission changes
To avoid the mission community payouts being given to players with a crimestat, they will no longer be able to accept the mission and should a player gain a CrimeStat during the mission they will lose access to the mission until their CrimeStat is removed. Reduced value of Xenothreat supply goods with the update to the mission payout logic. Increased amount and type of Xenothreat support ships players need to destroy before the Idris retreats. Slowed down Xenothreat Idris retreat quantum travel event to avoid it looking like it despawns instead of retreating.
