**Testing Focus**

**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu
Players will need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error. This is part of the bug where players used to see a Bad Token after a crash which blocked them from re-entering but with the latest changes, that error is no longer displayed.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Inventory Polish Pass
Made further performance improvements. Further polish pass on item grid sizes and SCU sizes for many items.
-     Healing, Downed State, and Medical Polish Pass
Increased the time and distance thresholds for placing actors into medical beds. Polish pass on medical gun and healing animation, UI, and interaction.
-     Quantum QOL
Made multiple fixes to help Quantum Drive engage more consistently. This should greatly help with issues related to aligning and spooling to a quantum target such as it not triggering when fully spooled and hitting B. Increased distance players QT into comm arrays so that they don't exit directly into the restricted area.
-     AI Behavior and Spawn Closet Polish
Made Improvements to help with unresponsive and teleporting AI in UGF missions and other locations in the PU. Spawn closets in UGF missions will now randomize which closets spawn friendly and hostile AI. This will also restrict each randomization to 1 faction (hostile or friendly) so that each closet cannot spawn opposing faction AI.
