***Please monitor sc-testing-chat in spectrum for updates and testing instruction*s.**

USER.cfg settings: r_displaySessionInfo = 1

Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Testing Focus**
-     Crusader
-     Orison Landing Zone
-     Constellation Taurus
-     Law System v2: Surrender
-     Power Management v2 (Capacitor Gameplay)
-     Missile Operator Mode
-     Radar, Scanning, and Ping T0
> Special Note: This build has a speculative fix to help with desync players have been experiencing during ship maneuvering. Especially after quantum traveling. This fix is to hopefully fix players exploding when hitting atmosphere as well as many other things like a player inside a ship seeing the ship at one location when the pilot has quantumed to another. We do not expect this to fix combat positional offsets but please keep an eye out for this as well. If you are able to, we would like players to test this and if the issues still occur, provide video if possible.
