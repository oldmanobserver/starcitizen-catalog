Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

**Issue Council Update: When creating a report, players are now asked whether they would like to allow developers to contact them about their reports if it is not already enabled. This setting is purely optional to help us track down hard to reproduce issues and can be disabled at any time in the Issue Council settings menu.**
