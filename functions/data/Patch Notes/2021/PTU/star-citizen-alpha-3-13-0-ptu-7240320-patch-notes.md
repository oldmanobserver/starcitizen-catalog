# New Features
Gameplay
-     Hull Visual Degradation
Introducing visual wear-and-tear to player ships as they age and degrade. Ships will subtly change depending on how long they have existed in the ‘verse until the ship is repaired using Cry-Astro Services or remade with an insurance claim. With the initial release most ships will have this but the following ships are currently not enabled: Anvil hawk, MISC Reliant, Archemides, Drake Dragonfly, Origin 600i, Anvil Gladitor, Vanduul Scythe, Drake Caterpillar, Anvil Valkyrie, Khartu-al, RSI Ursa Rover, Mustang variants, Anvil Terrapin.
-     Vehicle Names and Serial Numbers
Adding the ability for certain ships to display custom player-assigned names on the sides of their ships on the hull. Special serial numbers will also be shown, and all other ships will have unique serial numbers displayed, to identify them in the universe.
-     Ship to Ship Docking v1
Adding the ability to for the Merlin snub ship to dock and undock within the Constellation, along with guidance mode UI to ensure correct alignment during the docking process. Players will be able to use the autoland system and manual flight to dock. To take off from the constellation, press the landing gear keybind (default N). To start the docking process, target the Constellation then hit the landing gear keybind (default N) to initiate the docking UI. You can do the same to dock with another player's Connie but you will need to request permission to dock and have that player approve it after initiating the docking UI with their ship.
-     Reputation - UI Implementation
This feature adds the addition of a new mobiGlas app that will give players insight into their reputation with the important NPCs and organizations they have interacted with. This will also include a total list of reputation ranks, including those that have been completed and the ones they’re actively working on. 
-     Object Push & Pull
Mechanic allowing players to grab some larger objects and move them around an environment by either pushing or pulling them. The initial implementation will have usable trolleys that players can find in the world at space station cargo decks and underground facilities.
-     Mounted Gun Aiming T0
Further expanding the player's arsenal by allowing them to take control of a mounted gun on either a vehicle or the ground. These weapons will offer greater firepower and stability at the cost of mobility. With the initial implementation, players can find these scattered around junksites and underground facilities.
