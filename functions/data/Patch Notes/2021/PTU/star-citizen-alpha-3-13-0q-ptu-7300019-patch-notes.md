**Testing Focus**

**Note: **This build has a fix put in that should help stop the asset spawn queue from blocking stations, turrets, and mission objectives from streaming in for long periods of time. This was due to a docked ship inside the Connie going through large asteroid belts such as the Aaron Halo overloading the server with harvestables. If you have a Constellation on your account and have time, please test flying through the belt with your docked ship on servers you are on to see if this fix helped with the issue. Thank you!
