Current cloud tech is still in active development and not yet final. There's ongoing work on SDF occlusion which should help alleviate the graphical artifacting (visual dots in the clouds). Additionally, we are working towards having local VFX for the clouds (similar to the gas clouds around rest stops) which will make a big difference in overall quality.

# Feature Updates
Gameplay
-     Ongoing Ship Capacitor, Balance, and Polish Pass
We have done further core tuning for ships. Added secondary effects besides regen to capacitor assignments. Assignments to each system above default (33%) will now give you: more energy weapon ammo, more shield damage resistance, or reduced thruster boost costs scaling upward with increasing assignhment. Updated weapon regen pools for small fighters. Reduced damage on ballistic gatlings and repeaters. Tweaked heat per shot on ballistic gatlings. Added heat bar to the HUD for displaying weapon's temperature ratio. Replaced turret cannons with repeaters on Caterpillar. Changed Terrapin to use 2x S2 shields. Changed Caterpillar to use 2x S3 shields. Changed Hurricane to use 1x S2 shield. Changed Constellation to use 1x S3 shield. Increased base health of the Terrapin and Constellation series.
