*We are currently assessing if there are any performance and other issues while playing on Windows 11. If you are part of the windows insider program with Windows 10 or 11, you may have an option turned on called Diagnostic Data in the windows settings. This option is required for windows insider but appears to degrade game performance and turning this off may help framerates substantially.*

**Easy Anti-Cheat**
EAC has now been enabled in Star Citizen. This currently has a some known tools that will no longer function and some that we are looking into getting to work for future updates.

**Known to Work:**
-         Reshade v4.9.1 (requires renaming of reshade dxgi.dll to d3d11.dll)
- 	Voice Attack (1.8.4 64-bit)
- 	Joystick Gremlin version 13.3, Thrustmaster’s T.A.R.G.E.T.
- 	Track IR and Tobii v1.39.12028.0
- 	OpenTrack (2021.1.3)
- 	GameGlass (Latest Version 0.44.6.0)
**Known to Not Work:**
-  Devreorder 
-  Localization tools not working
-  Linux/Wine/DXVK/Sandboxie Plus do not work currently
-  LED lighting (LEDKeeper2) 
-  EVGA Precision X1 may have issues 
-  VorpX

**Known Issues**
-     Ground vehicles and initial spawn point
With this latest update, your initial spawn chooses the location of all your ships. If you have ground vehicles through the pledge store, selecting an initial home location that supports ground vehicles, like New Babbage, would be best.
-     Pledge Items lost on death
With this upcoming change, players will now lose all items equipped to their character upon death. These items include items from the pledge store including subscriber items. We are currently looking into different solutions for this but for 3.15.x be warned that if you die with subscriber items on, you will lose them in game but they will not be removed from your account or pledge store. These will be returned upon new major patches or through an account reset.
-     Bounty hunter mission updates slowly on a slow server
-     After a server crash, attempting to reconnect may result an infinite loading screen and being unable to interact with the menu. Players may need to exit the game and reload after a server crash to fix this error.
-     Players cannot repair, refuel, and rearm at outposts
-     MFD screens are often blocked by cockpit interaction prompts
-     Items stored in long term persistence such as mined gems are currently not stackable (This is something that will be coming in a future update)
-     Swapping weapons has a chance to drop or remove weapons
-     When in combat, NPCs can get stuck in cover when trying to exit
-     Announcer audio callout for "Match over. You have won/lost the match" can be heard multiple times at the end of a round in Arena Commander
-     When undocking, ships will occasionally become caught on the docking arm instead of detaching smoothly
