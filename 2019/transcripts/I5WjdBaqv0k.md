hello and welcome to another episode of
on the verse I'm Sean Tracy and I'm Eric
Kon Davis in today's update we'll call
some fully Mayhem with the audio team
check in on the new flight model as well
as build a map and some structures but
first let's see what the community has
been up to some players rang in the new
year with a PVE event that ended up
becoming a massive PVP battle M snipers
engaged the enemy turning a standard
attack Mission into an emergency Evac
situation yes Fighters and Evac Vehicles
work side by side to get the group to
safety But ultimately it well didn't
work out for them spoilers spoilers
sorry so moving on to development the
audio team have been up to their fully
Shenanigans again a recent recording
session in Austin captured practical
sound effects for a variety of in-game
uses sounds were captured that will be
used for physical eyes interactive props
bullet impacts and things like
that they also recorded various metal
objects colliding with each other to
emulate the sound of metal debris for
scenarios like ship parts being broken
or
[Music]
destroyed yeah and metal objects under
stress and strain to be used for
vibrational sound components for when
ship holes are under strain from damage
or atmosphere that'll be cool when
there's pressure in the cre that's cool
so impact and mechanical sounds were
recorded in a hanger size space with
microphones placed at close medium and
far distances from The Source yeah this
recording process is used to add a sense
of depth and Ambience to the
environments like
lorville additionally they used large
impacts on the steel plate to create
sounds that will be used when ships land
slide or make contact with other
objects devs have been digging into
various aspects in features with a
recent focus on combat landing and
takeoff heat management and Atmospheric
flight they've also been tweaking the
controls based on feedback from players
who got to try out the new flight model
experience at citizen con dialing in the
throttle logic and control among other
aspects so stay tuned to Future updates
for the continuing development of the
system and as we build out stand and the
entire universe we continue to improve
and refine the procedural tools that
allow us to create the massive
environments for Star Citizen massive
under understatement yeah say it any
bigger with more massive yeah for a look
at how procedural layout tools are
helping to build stations Habs and other
large structures let's go to Scott
Fitzgerald We Wan and Patrick
[Music]
aaro reason we developed the procedur
layout to is that we need a lot of
locations plenty of variation throughout
the entire universe of Star Citizen and
to do that we couldn't do it manually so
we needed a smart procedural tool to
achieve this goal and do the work the
key requirements for this procedural
tool was to ensure that the art team
didn't have to learn a new set of rules
and change drastically their
workflow we wanted to be able to control
prop placement tinting brand
we wanted to be able to say make
adjustments to an existing area how much
effort is involved in doing that so user
experience is key and from that we
should be able to create a larger
variety of environments with minimal
effort and therefore populate our
universe
quicker the core of the tool relies in
this building blocks that we call
Elements they represent for example
rooms of a space station and just pieces
of whatever the location needs to be
built off these building blocks are then
connected to each other through specific
attachment points that the artists or
designers can Define and all of this is
governed by a graph the graph is usually
used by designers because they want to
control the logical flow of the location
and make sure that the game play is
suitable for the player and this feeds
information to the elements via tags cuz
they control which element comes in and
which doesn't in the specific location
from this core things we develop
additional features for example an
intelligent smarter way to generate
routes between these elements for
example
corridors and also some verticality
control so that we can build larger
locations and larger space stations like
larger truck STS and refineries that
will come later in the game the design
requirements for the procedural tours to
allow us to have more control over how
we distribute the rooms so this in tail
would bring towards a much larger rest
stop the idea here is we can now start
blending into separate floors of one
sort of stair stairwell node that we run
from here so with using the selection of
rooms that we've
configured through the LTA
set running some uh seed variations off
of this node
graph we can start to make some very
very large rest
stops taking everything from the truck
stop learning from all that refining the
development of the pipeline as we went
along we can now roll that out to
looking at Habs for the Habs at the
moment we can theme them so it it
tailors to the occupant so if we have a
weight lifter we can actually have
weights there you can have protein
shakes and so on and those will spawn in
appropriately we can theme the
apartments to do that if he's a
scientist perhaps he has a little hobby
on the side a military guy security and
so on but if it's a civilian well who
knows we could have any number of props
that they they have an interest in so
yes it's really powerful to be able to
generate a large number of apartments
and
Habs just by clicking a button
[Music]
didn't you uh show something like that
at a previous citizen con busted yes
you're right so yes we did and uh we
showed basically the first iteration of
the procedural layout tool with the uh
uh procedural Planet tools at the same
time so I like to call it procedural
assistance rather than procedurally
generating because it definitely helps
the designers along U so Scott way and
Patrick uh led by Marco been working on
this for a little while the the big job
though uh that they had finished is one
tons of usability improvements but
generally moving the whole tool from a
python uh uh Tool uh into C++ so
properly embedding it in the engine and
the editor and everything not just a
python layer on top so it's faster uh a
little bit easier to maintain that's
very cool what tools that are we we're
working on right now that you're really
excited about that we can talk about
that's a fantas question um oh man I
mean it's going to sound like not a very
interesting tool I think to people but
uh it's a huge huge deal it's the um
basic asset referencing database I would
say is the one I'm most excited about
because what that's going to give us the
ability to do and none of the community
really sees this our inclusions
inclusion exclusions thing the way our
streams are
allows us to decouple our data from uh
pu and Squadron 42 properly um so that
there's no cross talk really me between
them yes Squadron can include some pu
stuff but pu stuff shouldn't be
including Squadron stuff so aset
referencing database makes us ship only
what we use and only what we need rather
than us kind of having to just take care
of it manually um it'll be nice
automated that's great well that's going
to be exciting we've also just started
working on a new 3D map feature that
will make traversal easier here is Simon
bery with more
so the area we're working on right now
is called uh the the local area map so
we have the star map in the game so this
is the equivalent for when you're
walking around on foot at the moment
we're at the end of the prev
visualization phase the the first thing
was is it going to be 2D or 3D everybody
wanted to do 3D so we did a test out and
it looked looked pretty good there's
also things like do we want to be able
to see the enemy characters on there so
we did a little test for that um also it
was interesting how we work out how the
player moves between floors looking at
the map so how they look at the next
floor up next floor down that kind of
thing it's a case of working how to make
that in the game in a functional way so
UI team itself is is fairly small and
there's all these big systems in the
game that this links in with so um we
have to deal with the other teams for
example that we have to work out how we
get that the map information from the
level where do we store the locations of
all the items all that kind of thing so
there's there's lots of things to talk
about with the rest of the studio to get
this done and also it also needs a
certain level of call so you know what
out it looks good and makes it a bit
different to to other games at the
moment it doesn't have that quite that
level of visual polish that we want so
we want it to look want it to be as good
as what you'd see in a Sci-Fi movie for
example so just now it's it's functional
and it's fine um but we don't want fine
we want it to look really good as the
game's got bigger obviously there's more
places to get lost now so that having a
map is has become more important with a
feature like that uh he says that it's
you know just coming to the end of the
prev stage but how complicated is to
take a feature like that you know all
the way into the game you know you be
dictating this direct feature itself but
you know what's the normal lifespan of a
feature like that and how what it's
going to take to e in the game sure and
I mean it really of course depends on
the feature and I like that we're
talking about 3D maps because it's
something that I've been very very very
keen to have actually the first time I
sort of traes around the outside of the
the one of the ships trying to get in
looking for a particular door and I
didn't know where it was now a lot of
people go yes learning immersion I
totally understand that but sometimes I
just want to know where to go so I I
think taking a feature you know from
from from just idea all the way to in
game already is a pretty decent Chu of
time right but the most important thing
you've just got to get that that unified
objective or that intent what's the
intent of the feature the intent of the
feature is not make a 3D map right it's
a I I I want the player to know where he
is I want the player to understand how
to get to the next position or something
like this where it's um you know to use
a production term like a user story
basically is some sort of unified
objective to the feature so once you get
there you get some level of previs done
um and as they were talking about they
wanted higher and higher visual Fidelity
with this and to make it look different
from the other games because yes other
games have done 3D maps like this before
you've got you know Zelda breath of the
wild these kind of games um that have
done them before so how do we
differentiate or how do we take some
great version great uh features out of
thatp and and add some more to it so
basically he'll get it from this concept
get the unified objective get the nice
visuals to it and now get an in-game
prototype going and at that point you're
going to really work on your
functionality so that's where all the
iteration will come in right um and that
will usually take the vast majority of
that feature time so usually to get a
feature just online and you're working
with it and playing with it is really
fast most of the time it's it's it's
maintenance and bugs uh after the fact
that are going to come up so that bit of
iteration that goes on um also some
things can add or remove complexities
one of the one of the big pieces that he
talked about was enemies okay so those
enemies on the map and and not being
directly related to the feature you know
I'm going to ask my own questions uh are
those enemies players or those AI
because actually that might change how
that that that feature being developed
and it might take a little bit longer if
that's actually going to be showing
players as enemies how do they know the
players are enemies doesn't it have to
check the reputation system doesn't it
have to check the crime stats doesn't
have to check all of those sort of
things just to show a little red blip on
the radar right so um yeah I think
there's a lot of pieces that can go into
that feature but uh generally to take
those features all the way through you
got that concept phase you've got you
know unified objective kind of user
story kind of phase iteration on the
feature you've got a bit of polish at
the end some feedback maybe a little
more polish and then a shipping there
you go that's cool and what what would
be the difference on say something like
that in a multiplayer environment like
Star Citizen versus a single player
environment like Squad 42 it's a good
question it changes a lot between
different features right like if you
have a weapon and and you're firing the
weapon in multiplayer versus single
player very very different things so it
depends on what that map's going to have
to do but yeah multiplayer featur is
definitely harder yeah very cool aome
that does it for us uh this week a big
