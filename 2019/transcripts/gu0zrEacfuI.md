hi everybody welcome to star citizen
live game dev modular space stations I'm
your host Jerry uh could be a non Today
Show we're gonna be doing a bit of the
exploration of process related to the
creation of our modular space station
interiors if you're a player of star
citizen in recent patch we we created
our we added a bunch of modular space
station exteriors and so with the
continuing form of development now we've
moved on to the interiors and joining us
on the show this week is senior
environment artists from boundary if I'm
old name habits cloud Imperium games in
the UK Joel as a party Joel how you
doing man hey how are you I'm doing well
thank you for playing for joining us on
the show we were talking about this
before we haven't had you on very out
death and we had John for like an art
Corp retrospective kind of thing last
year I think that was it yeah well
welcome aboard so you're a senior
environment artist let's take a few
moments and just talk a little bit about
what you do for star citizen sure so as
an environment artist I'm responsible
for creating and maintaining levels
within the universe that could be like
from a small section to like a larger
section like out core as well as
authoring smaller assets like walls
flows and tanks and things like that so
that's that's what I do as an
environmentalist would you say yes would
you say your focus is more towards
man-made objects so I know that artists
all have different kind of specialties
and fields some work almost entirely on
organic stuff some work entirely on
structures and technology where would
you say your focus is definitely on on
hard surface man-made stuff hard
surfaces is the term I'm typically going
for for things that are sci-fi or
mechanical as opposed to like you
wouldn't describe like a Tudor style
medieval building is hard surface even
though the practices
and the approach to developing that
content is the same so I actually didn't
know that's that's specificity to
hard-surface I like I would have called
it like a medieval castle if you were
modeling at hard service modeling yeah
just technology and sci-fi stuff is
that's something just internally here at
CID or is that something you found
that's kind of throughout the industry
well throughout the industry you like
I'm sure there's people out there who
sitting there saying I'm wrong you know
you could be wrong about anything but at
least that's what I've come to know like
growing up and and learning in in this
industry that you know hard surfaces
when someone says hard surface they're
talking about like either subdivision
modeling or sci-fi just thinking we
could use that as a tagline for starts
is in life you can be wrong about
anything so stars in life is our live
broadcast where we we demonstrate a bit
of process a bit of the what goes into
the nitty gritty the behind the scenes
of a particular feature or aspect of
game development in a more long form
approach on today's show we're going to
be exploring the process of using our
our procedural generation tools are
tagging system all that stuff to create
modular space station interiors right
yep
before we get started I saw a question
and guys you can submit your questions I
threw out to a twitch chat while we're
live here apologies if you're watching
this later on YouTube you missed it you
missed the opportunity but you submit
your questions by preface in your
question with the word question in
capital letters surrounded by brackets
we'll do our best to pull a couple of
those from the show throughout the show
when we do these process things it's
more like a more like a presentations
more like a through-line for for Jewel's
process so we're not going to get as
many questions in this week as we would
in other weeks but we'll do our best to
kind of pepper them in where we can
before we get started one of the
questions that just came through was
though what what are your influences my
influences or Stahl's
obviously I think you've gotta go past
our walls if you're pure sci-fi artist
and Ralph McQuarrie's an excellent
concept artist by drama is it and is
another great one
lots of old even though it's it's not
quite relevant to sci-fi like Jim Henson
movies like the Dark Crystal
right um anything there's like strong
world building is definitely an
influence of mind not just art you know
that's you know why I was drawn to
stassi's and in general was because it's
a persistent universe it's it's a living
breathing world and to me it captures
you know the stuff that Jim Henson was
doing you know with the Dark Crystal and
you know even the labyrinth movies and
stuff hello when the yeah they guessed
you that promo worked for me and I don't
know now I was trying to think of what
we should do it we should do a show
where we try to find the one person it's
the idea that's not inspired by Star
Wars and then push them out the door I
know alright so let's get started here I
understand you've got it you've got a
scene set up in the editor for us yep
it's just so that no anything so I so
what are we looking at here so we're
looking at a room within what are the
space station interiors just a small
portion of a one room of many many rooms
and many different types of rooms bare
bones which is nothing really going on
except for some some intermediate
structural assets going on and right
basically what we're going to do today
is I'm going to walk you through the
process and we're going to do a bit of
practical work and you know a little bit
of theory work on how we can go from
this and we can quickly generate
something like this or if we don't like
this layout we can click a preview
button and let it load for a second and
we're going to see a completely
different set of props different layout
different lighting and we can keep doing
this until we're quite happy we
is with how things are kind of laid out
and this is just like a validation tool
for us so we just went previewing it at
the moment like the real thing happens
when we generate the entire station
interior and then these rooms come in
randomly and then some objects of that
that room come in randomly and the
lighting changes randomly yeah I don't
want I don't want to bury the lede here
you didn't just switch between two
different layers and a map you click the
button and procedural generation system
then went through read all the tags that
work that are assigned to the different
areas of this level and then pulled a
randomized set of options that match
those tags yeah correct so it's created
a layer for me here so that might might
be throwing you off but we can go ahead
and just delete that if no one believes
us so we'll click it again and of course
procedurally generating in it a space
station is not a super quick that's why
so we'll just sit here then and it's not
just the asset so it looks like it's
bringing in lighting and environment
effects yep that's the whole point of it
so where did they replace me spheres
come in so I the easiest way to troll
any environment artist is to say is that
a replacement you just watch them sweat
yeah okay you're driving I'm from the
passenger let's go so I'll break down
what exactly is going on on here what
are the different components that are
making this this whole thing work so we
start off with like a room type so if
you look on on the right here we're
working with says uni large these are
universal large rooms
and the kind of very generic large
travursel rooms if you if you will you
can say over over here on the
as well we've got different like purpose
rooms so we've got stairs we've got side
rooms we've got a shafts lockers etc but
we're going to be focusing on they're on
the Uni large rooms for now and so we
start off with a pretty bare-bones
I'm turning on this overlay so we can
see through this moody lighting there
it's kind of like a husk of a room
there's a lot of there's a lot of holes
you know there's not much dressing going
on and that's perfect for the base room
because what we do is we we also what's
called an overlay which comes in and
it's got some lighting in it it's got
some structural changes that fill those
holes in and we do this we don't
completely do the entire room
procedurally because we like to have
like a finite amount of control over
what we're going to get so if we just
take away specific chunks and then we we
make sure that the things that can fill
that in are validated and and kind of
handled by an artist where you're gonna
see like the best results instead of
just like leaving it all to chance ya
wanna throw in the chat right now is
asking how much control do you have over
procedural generation and we were
talking a little bit about this before
we went live just in our little pre chat
about how we use procedural generation
as a tool to support our artists you
know the procedure generation is not the
end goal of building these things it's
it's really about assisting folks like
you in creating the sheer number of
space stations and environments that
we're going to need for a game of this
scale yeah that's that's exactly right
as all saying we if we give it if we
allow it all to chance then chances are
we'll be sitting there regenerating
these rooms like four hours until we've
come across something that's not broken
mm-hmm and works and then there's a
chance that it's like ninety percent
perfect and we're like right we still
have to throw it away because we need to
procedurally generate that last 10
percent this kind of allows us to handle
a lot of the work but also offload a lot
of the more granular work that would
usually do to the procedural system and
and fill in the gaps that way so we've
got two overlays for this room we've got
a third one this is one will will will
make later on you can see the main kind
of structure of this room remains the
same but we've got these big elements
within the room that can change
procedurally and within these overlays
for go back to this one is a bit more
well lit we have these orange boxes
dotted around periodically and these are
what we call secondary elements so these
are the the props that come in it's not
it's not constraint to just spawning in
props it can spawn in advertisement it
can spawn in anything really because
it's tied to a prefab system and the
prefab is just a collection of objects
that get stored to an XML file so that
way we can keep track of it and on load
time it reads from that prefab library
so if we need to make changes to a
prefab or we make new ones each time the
the client or the editor loads we get
the latest version of that whereas
before if something statically placed in
the level and we we update it we don't
really have kind of find out control of
how that's affecting the world around it
but with a prefab we've got a lot more
control and flexibility so if I'm
understanding right it's not just it's
not just this is a sign and every time
that you hit generate it just gives you
a different sign you can actually the
same location can be filled with the
different types of props yeah so we
could we could be as tight with our
specification of what we want to spawn
here or we could go very wide so you'll
see on these on these orange volumes
secondary element we can see a category
filter so we're looking for floral and
maintenance props with a maximum
dimension of 4 on x 1.5 on y and 3 in
the z axis and again with the minimum
minimum dimensions so that's saying that
any any prop that we find that fits
these tags these floral and and
maintenance and then can also fit within
these bounds go ahead and bring it in
and there could be four five six
different versions of flora line
maintenance that fit within that spot we
can we can preview what what one's going
to give us so we can use the same same
button to preview specific elements and
then we can use the same tool to preview
like the entire room so we're just going
to run through and try generate a few
props on this spot so you see we've got
like a bucket a generator and a dolly
let's see if there's if there's more
items in this library and we got the
same one and leaving it to chance that
means that we might see the same one
I'll pop a few times so we got a
different one spawning in now it's
really a collection of libraries that
there's the overall asset library and
then the library breaks down different
themes and then after themes it breaks
down into different you know subsections
of types and you can just add to these
later down the line without having to go
through and rebuild every space station
you can just add more industrial floor
props here and it just it just continues
to build to the library yeah that's
right so the more we work on it like the
more we're going to see like cascading
changes throughout the entire game it as
opposed to like making a static location
we build at once we put it in the wild
and you know it's what you see what you
get like we can we can start changing
like the very small and there
you know it's a very small get
propagated and then we can start
changing the very big and we're just
gonna say a whole lot of changes but
you're right in like this is just a
small element and you might you might
not see a whole lot of change like it is
still going to look for maintenance my
type prop so you might see like the same
prop aligned differently and you might
be thinking well you know that's not
super unique but it's just a different
arrangement but it's kind of a cascading
effect so on the top level we have we
can generate the entire station interior
which procedurally picks what kind of
rooms at once it's going to throw in a
couple unis large rooms some of our our
bespoke rooms I've you know belong to
the rest or relax brand and stairs
inside rooms etc within within those
rooms themselves because we've got we
can see here on the right we've got five
different you know uni large rooms so
we're going to have up to like five
different variations of a uni large room
so when when the system goes I want to
uni large room it's got five to pick
from and then just yeah within those
five it's got two overlays minimum like
well we could do one overlay in some
cases but as it stands we got two per
per you need large room and then each
one of those has the ability to pull in
either or a and B at the moment it could
be more and then within those overlays
we have the ability or these props to
spawn in procedurally and if we're not
as particular about what spawns here we
can we can kind of expand the volume and
we could say either do maintenance or
maybe storage or seats or planters etc
and like within this you will start
seeing different items pop up and each
time you come into a station you know
you're you're in and out are gonna be
completely different you might come in
from from this area or you might come in
from this area
or this area depending on what station
you kind of spawn out
so you're seeing the room from a
different angle but as well as that
you're seeing different rooms on the
other side of that so with a different
layer on different props so you're gonna
like we're trying to reduce like the
visual fatigue of seeing the same static
room over and over and over again with
the same chair and the table with open
noodle box on the side now you're
obviously a environment artist so many
of the questions that are coming in as
they always do tend to tend towards
gameplay and yeah obviously an artist is
not here to speak about game plays
that's not their area but there was a
question I thought it was close enough
that I think you maybe you'd have some
insight it said when generating rooms
how do you ensure that there are no
holes between the prefab collisions
where players could squeeze into and
fall or get the places that they
shouldn't yeah so that's that's kind of
another reason why we do half you know
handle third half procedural so if there
is an instance like that and QA come to
us and say hey we've got players getting
stuck in an area that they aren't meant
to for this area for instance say your
props were able to spawn and we're able
to get up on those props and then jump
over the railing and get stock obviously
you know when where death has
consequences we're going to see a lot
less of that but you know it people like
to explore in this repercussion free
state of the game so they're going to
they're going to do that so that means
that because half of its hand authored
and we have control like all right we
can't guarantee that we're not going to
get a prop so they can get up on it and
jump over the railings which means that
we might relook at this area here and
maybe put some safety nets in so players
can't fall down there and get stock so
that's that's how we would kind of it's
going to happen and that's why we kind
of do half hand or third half procedures
so we have finite control over fixing
that stuff
obviously we get finite control over how
it looks as well but that's how we're
going to ensure that we can reliably fix
those issues when they pop up okay now
we are 20 minutes to the show so sure I
mean there's no rush I just want to let
you know we're what we're we're so cool
we could jump into some of the meat and
bones of it and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna make a third overlay for
this uni large room we're not going to
do a whole lot because that could take a
little bit so what I've done is I've
duplicated a and I've made a new overlay
see and I reckon we can maybe do
something different in this in this area
here so let's see what we're working
with by turning off to the main room so
these are all the assets that come in
with an overlay so it looks like we got
a decent chunk to work with so let's
turn back the room and we want to leave
that the base room unscathed otherwise
it's going to start affecting different
elements so I can see right now that I
think in fact that this wall module is a
prop itself which is like another bonus
like we don't always have to use these
procedurally like if they look good and
we want to ensure that that's always
there we can use that as as just a stock
stand a prefab and that means we get
something as complex as this or little
to no work well someone has to do it
once obviously but if other people like
that and it works for the environment
they're working on you know it's a time
saver as well so I'm just gonna go ahead
and open this brief up because I want it
I want what's in it we saw a little bit
of this when we were doing our decorate
in the back alley of our court bit with
yeah blue on actually guess it was 2 or
3 months ago now
and the prefer but I can grab these and
I think maybe what might be cool is if
we have some big pipes coming and and
intersecting into here so I'm just going
to duplicate this pipe will see with if
we have any bigger ones there we go
there's a nice big one and we can do we
can do small changes like this so we
could do large changes in a room like we
could pretty much do the same overlay
with one area quiet quite different and
it all Cascades like that's another
variation in the works that we can pull
from and that's another situation where
you're gonna you're going to be seeing a
completely brand-new room with a click
above with a click of a button pretty
much so let's see if there's a corner
brush for this pipe and this size
corners and what's a corner brush it's
just the pipe set pops up you know
they're broken down names of working
down so that quite human readable so a
pipe straight would be a straight piece
of pipe of popcorn or etc so that way we
can kind of know what we're looking for
different puzzle pieces like the flat
edge puzzle pieces and the corner puzzle
piece isn't correct or you can say this
this prefab is getting in that way so
what we could do see whereas we can put
him I think up here we've already got
one there
think of all our bases of covered pretty
much might be able to throw it in now
this is literally what you're doing in
your day to day we're in the process of
building out all of these different
interior modules and prefabs that will
populate the modular space station
Cera's when it comes online when they
come online so it was asking how do
these procedural layouts compare to the
shape of the exteriors do you do you
just you just do you build the interiors
and then look for exterior that match do
you start with an exterior
how do those match up between interior
and exterior yeah so that's a good
question what we do is we kind of have
an approximate collision volume that
represents the exterior of is of a
station so we kind of you know we want
to make sure that where there's an
interior there's it's connected to a
nice view room outside so there's
there's a kind of a point on the
exterior that we know that the stations
going to be stemming from almost because
we know that we want the interiors to
have a view room to the outside station
so there's points all along exterior
that we can we can kind of guarantee
where it's going to start from and then
we build a collision volume around these
different elements so with the ring
we've got a ring collision element or if
it if we want station interior in like
one of the lateral sections of the
station we've got a collision volume
over that and what that means is that
the interior procedural system will just
keep going and it will try it why it's
it's going to guarantee that it won't
clip through those collision volumes so
within within those bounds would say
that the station rings are those big new
rings it's going to just fill in inside
of that physical ring so we don't really
have to do much much work to make the
two fit together
because we just have we know what the
station looks like we know what the
components are so we can kind of do a
collision model of that and just say use
the interior space
and that's a big advantage of the
tagging system when everything is tagged
appropriately the system just knows
which ones to match up to what yeah and
the station next series were developed
with this the same techniques or you
know how we're starting to see a lot of
variation between station exteriors it's
the same process as as well all we're
using at the moment as well so there's a
question like a mini Cheerios will this
tech allow you to do more locations more
quickly in the future
yes um yeah that's that's the idea like
we're not with these uni uni rooms
they're not just for station interiors
it's for anything where it's appropriate
to use a room like this the same same
style same kind of feel that we're going
for with interiors we can use these and
especially the prop the prop volumes
here that this is our like
bread-and-butter even though it's the
smallest element in it this is the
library we're gonna keep expanding and
expanding every time we get something
new we're gonna put it in the prop
library and even even you know the the
landing zone people can use these these
elements because it doesn't need to be
procedurally brought in it is a prefab
at the end of the day so we're we're
working on like how we can speed up and
quickly iterate and build out these
locations with little to no human input
obviously we want to make sure that
design have gone through and there's a
logical logical location to exist and we
want to make sure that it it meets you
know our goals artistically yeah it's
one of the most one of the most common
questions we get is a variation of that
one about you know if this is taking
this long how do you expect to be able
to do X in the future and it's because
all this development is designed to be
exponential it's the hardest part is
building all the tools is building all
the
teachers building all the the tile sets
and once that steps done once you know
every every planet makes the next planet
faster every moon makes the next moon
faster every Space Station makes the
next Space Station and you're just that
much faster and it's it again sometimes
be kind of hard to see especially if
you've been following the project as
closely as a many of us have just you
know did it's it's like when you put a
lobster in water and you're slowly
turning the temperature up the lobster
doesn't notice you know that the
temperature is getting is getting hotter
we turn the speed and frequency up and
we get better and more efficient at
making these with each asset yeah so
yeah that's right it's making recyclable
content as well having that theory in
the back of our mind they're like you
know we're building a room it's got a
it's got to have longevity in it it's
got to be reusable so that's that's why
we build these rooms in a certain way as
well because there's no point making it
all bespoke in the colonial exists in
one location because that's that's no
good for reusability yes Chet I just
called you all lobsters and I said that
you were all being boiled alive Thank
You Chet that danger analogies with
Jared Huckaby this I mean this could be
better it could be integrated a bit more
about you know I wasn't expecting you
know take to go so like it's a complex
base the procedural system
maybe I'll just I'll cap this off so you
know to hide any kind of oakley's that
are going back on their back there and
then I'm gonna export this overlay that
we've done to the prefab library let's
make sure lines up
yeah obviously one of the challenges
whenever we do these game to have
segments is that people's work don't
often fit into a nice 1 hour block
yeah if everything could be done in one
hour blocks a game developer would be a
whole lot easier than it actually is
so we're doing a shortened abbreviated
not quite as precise version of this
whenever we do these shows so you you've
made a collection of items here and
you're now going to export it over to
the prefab yeah I've just I've just
changed up this one little section so
we're not going to see any grand kind of
changes in the arc in the architecture
you'll just see something slightly
different over here obviously you know
in full capacity would go a bit beyond
just doing by placing a couple of pipes
and some grates
just because you know you want to do
enough that it warrants another overlay
you can't just change like you know a
floor around because there's much better
and efficient methods for doing that ok
like the problems if you just want to
change one element turn it into a
procedural prop and then it can be as
random as at once so we're going to jump
into these handy tools here which Y has
been hard at work on and this is like
the the main go-to tools that were using
to help us along the way and what we're
going to do is we're just going to
export this out to a prefab library and
I'll show you library after after we do
it so I'm just going to say I want uni
large or five overlay C and I want to
put it in the room share to overlay I'm
gonna sign it and that's all hunky-dory
that's fine so we can turn that off we
can turn these overlays off and I'll
show you
the prefab library if this window wants
to jump over come on
there yeah so in this room shared
overlay I've got unis room large I might
have to refresh this actually and then
we've got overlay see which is the
overlay we just made and we can just
drag this in as a normal prefab and see
obviously might not line up because I'm
just dragging it into an arbitrary
location but you can see there's our
pipes that we changed just gonna delete
that back into that bare-bones level
that we started with and then we're just
gonna click this preview button a few
times we might not see ll1 straight away
because it is procedural right we are
one in three chance of seeing it but
let's hope let's see if we can get up
first Gary so the people the people in
chapter like just make this show longer
work yeah it's back to work after this
it's so we didn't see how change yeah so
we'll go again and like this might be a
good showcase of just all the different
variations we come across along the way
out of there we go there's the room we
made together the one that there's the
there's the new layout with the asset
you just created yep so you know
something like this that changes the
silhouette of that area like they're
they're very strong changes they're the
ones that you kind of noticed because as
you're running through these stations
like a lot of this is going to be a blur
so strong silhouette changes are always
good because you just say I'll hold up I
don't you know my orientations off
because I'm used to being able to see
like this corner coming up
so yeah that that works so I thought how
much time we yeah we got a plenty of
time so I thought would go over and we
would make a prop volume as well and
then we would throw it into the mix and
see if we can get one of these overlays
that this born in a new prop and we can
highlight that end of the process as
well it's really quite similar because
at the crux of it it revolves around a
prefab system
so actually why don't we go here let's
let's find let's turn on this early
what were we working with yeah
volumes turned off somebody Chad's
asking do you ever think about just
making a really clean space station
sometimes a really clean location that
isn't dirty and messy and disorganized
yeah I mean if the style calls for we
will but the style for the station's at
least these ones in the stanton system
it's utilitarian these aren't new that
they've been here for a very long time
and it is a large location to keep track
of so you're gonna see a bit of things
run wild within it it's not going to be
kept updated updated and it depends as
well like within these utilitarian
station interiors as well we do have
kind of like higher focused areas where
it's more of a communal space where they
would focus their attention on so that
might be a bit more cleaner and high-end
and less maintenance props around like
you wouldn't expect to see these
maintenance props in every single room
this is more of you know that back
traversal alley that that none of this
the people who live here care too much
about enough to to do something about it
also a real easy way just to make
something feel lived-in yeah
but definitely why we're still working
on utilitarian stations they can look
they're gonna be a bit lived in and a
bit beaten up but that doesn't mean that
you know we don't entertain the ideas of
what a high-tech station might look like
or a station by a different manufacturer
these are resting relaxed earned
stations so they're gonna kind of feel
like a public rest stop back on you know
route 65 or something like that just
don't go into the toilets captain
coasters lived in doesn't have to mean
dirty no it doesn't but it sure does
help yeah besides I think without giving
too much away as we work towards a
location like micro tech you'll probably
see me seeing a more cleaner aesthetic
the two the two planets we've we've got
so far Hurston and our corporal are very
industrialized or very mechanically
inclined stuff like that as we as we
move towards other locations like micro
tech and an Crusader I think you'll
you'll see more of probably what what
you're asking about yeah you can just
say you know better population on those
planets as well little tolerance for
wrongdoings and one also the people who
live there are gonna be a bit more
sophisticated and someone I would say
more maybe perhaps more organized but
they don't say yeah they're not they're
not better because they make their bed
you tell my mom that for years all right
so we saw that while using a storage tag
in the other room so we're gonna go and
we'll make a shelf I don't know why a
shelf what's born here but for the sake
we can for we're gonna do it I'll show
you how we can kind of within the same
kind of system storage storage come in
boxes that can mean shelves any kind of
container really we can still get kind
of guarantee
that we're not going to sport a shelf in
there by setting things up smarter so
they did we explain what this level is
that we're looking at right now that
this is our library yeah this is a level
that where you've just got everything
that you can pull from kind of splayed
out with some yeah with with some debug
text helping you identify which each one
is so this just helps us so we're not
you know someone's not making vending
machines over here on someone else is
making vending machines over here if we
want to go in and debug vending machines
or make new ones we know where to come
to so we got you know a wide range of
things and and this this library is
always going to be expanding as well so
might look a bit bare-bones before like
a really huge station interior but it's
something that we're gonna work on all
the time on every location we're gonna
be populating this with new things that
you know someone someone might set dress
apart manually I mean like oh great I
actually want to be able to reuse that
procedurally we're just you ain't get
put it in this prop library and then
everyone benefits from it across the PU
anyone who's making a location from the
PU will benefit from this library Zirin
has are the modules system related as in
star citizen related can we expect
different themes and different star
systems I would say absolutely yeah
yeah I think you know it's it's it's
easy to forget that we're still building
the stanton system and even though the
Stan system has our corporate Hurston
and micro tech it is still you know one
region of space so there's going to be a
lot of similarities a lot of shared
shared aspects between them all correct
so I'm gonna jump the gun a little bit
and we're going to take this procedural
layout info box and this is the box that
tells those orange box am i compatible
so this has a dimensions three by two by
one and it has some tags on that storage
Lorelei
so when those are in the box our look
looking for those tags and those
dimensions it's going to use this and
the dimensions come from the bounds
itself so it's not as much of an
estimation so what we're looking for is
Floor Store comm which means it's floor
aligned it's a storage and it's a common
element so it's common is it pretty much
more sophisticated word for generic so
we want to make a new one a new layer
actually we're gonna leave the layer
because I don't know how big this this
shelf is going to be and we like to
organize layers by the dimensions so
we're just gonna go to town first and
worry about the layer later and we can
turn off volumes so this blue box isn't
in our way so we're gonna look for some
shelves this containers maybe none of
those
let's just search for shelf
scroll Paran that's good now we could go
in as well and we could populate the
contents of this shelf with additional
secondary elements like we could go as
deep as we want obviously there's a
point where we're saying that that's
that's deep enough because we we want to
keep track of like any issues that arise
and and if we're seeing an issue on this
shelf and then we're going to look at
the shelf and it turns out it's
something on the Shelf that's causing
the issue well I'll go into that then
and that's something within that thing
that's on the shelf that's causing the
issue and we have to go in there again
we're gonna get lost pretty easily so
Russian nesting dolls yeah we can we can
definitely do it like I'll show you
let's turn volumes back on and see if we
can spot something with here we go so
this seat here
so this seat is it's got a secondary
element in it
so we're saying what's it looking for
it's just looking for any floral and
element that fits these dimensions so
whenever this seat comes in we have the
ability to spawn in something completely
random with it as well so for example it
could come in with come in with a trash
can any one of these trash cans etc
anything that really fits in that and
then in the future because it hasn't
very it hasn't been kind of spelled out
to to spawn in a specific thing it's
just saying anything that goes on the
floor spawn me in as we make new things
we make new new props if it fits those
dimensions we're gonna start seeing that
seat come in with that new thing that we
made with no effort from us at all which
is just more added variation I don't
think we will add those secondary
elements in here and like because then I
have to create another prop volume too
populate these shelves so we will just
do it manually but in the future I think
I think a shelf is one of those those
structures that you can justify having
another secondary element in here so
because what good's a shop with nothing
on it yeah so what can we put on here we
can put up books I can try looking for
some some books these cardboard in the
future still cardboard or is it
starboard synthetic tree material maybe
just an idea for the riders outlet that
was from mr. square peg don't blame me
well I'm the one who read it I guess you
blame me a little bit what else we got
any larger books I don't know there's
something compelling about a giant
bookshelf with only one book on it makes
it seem like that one book is super
important what is that one book with
super important the Bureau of shipyard
development nobody's interested in ship
your development something we need to go
off grid for these final movements we
don't have too much time so it might end
up being quite a bad burn shelf unless I
can find some bigger props than just a
itty bitty book to fill this with would
be enough to demonstrate alright there's
multiple books at my help look older I
could be some like hidden relics
we're filling in a bit more space now
which is good and as we going on you
could probably see how you know if we
were working with a prop library and
we'll just kind of like doing this one
off on on a location like you know I've
got a room I might want a bookshelf
there and I start populating it with
books and then that's it that's it
exists there and there only and then
someone else comes along and in their
area they they're like oh um I want a
bookshelf and then they're doing the
same thing there's there's a lot of like
work that it's been done and you can't
really reuse it that's why we're
populating this library as well because
now I really only have to build this
bookshelf once and anyone can use it so
if you if you're in the location you
like you know I think my room could use
a bookshelf you come in here and you get
one pre dressed and you know even if you
don't want as it is you want to go in
and you want to change change it up so
it's it's unique it's your own spin you
can do that you can extract the items
from the prefab the important thing is
that you're getting like half the way
there yeah although I'm gonna say
there's a public service announcement to
anybody if you walk into any space
station and you see a bookshelf with
nine copies of the same fish tank book
run somebody's trying to kill you idea
there's a killer on the loose it's too
many copies of fish tank books
something's not right here
I think the author's trying to you know
give out free copies so yeah I mean this
this works for for you know the demo
purposes we're not trying to show you
like flash flash er and it's showing
that like the process so now what we
want to do is we we want to match this
volume as close as we can
so if we click on this we can kind of
get some dimensions out of it I know
it's a 2.7 meters tall and 2 meters
across and 7.75 so I've forgotten all
those numbers already so we go on X 2.75
and how tall was it again
275 it doesn't have to be the most
accurate but because in the other level
all you're seeing is those empty volumes
it's best to have something that closely
approximates the volume that way you can
you can kind of guarantee that if
something spawns in there it's not going
to clip through this stuff near it and
the walls and stuff like that because
you can see that that volume that it's
coming in as looks like I'm off a bit I
mean it is just that just an estimate at
this point so who cares or something
like this so that we know that you know
this anything if you've got stuff
clipping into these these bounds on the
other end you know that the geometry is
going to come in clipping and because I
copied this info box from over here I
don't have to set up the tags but I'll
go into that briefly just to show you
it's not like voodoo or anything
we've just got on this info box a code
that comes is generated from picking
some tags so we go low-tech utilitarian
it's floral and and it's storage we
could take more or less tags as we need
and we can make new tags as well so if
we get to a point where storage isn't
descriptive enough and we're getting you
know the storage volume has expanded
considerably and we're starting to see
less than desirable results spawn in
then we can start thinking about having
a new tag
kind of subdivide storage into different
storage if somebody's asking in chat if
if should we choose to could we go even
further down this rabbit hole and start
procedurally generating the array of
books like if we tagged every single
book in yeah you could
there would be an extent of how deep you
want to do that every single book
prestige all might be a bit overkill but
definitely like you know each one of
these brushes that are placed could
definitely be a volume that way so I
don't have to manually kind of randomize
it like I'm never gonna be able to
randomize something as good as a
computer can do so if I want to random
like no I didn't I didn't kind of when
you're getting in the mindset of of
setting these props down and stuff like
that I'm not placing these books the
people who believed here are placing
these books kind of thing so you kind of
want to detach yourself from you know
it's me I'm I'm some omnipotent being
placing books in star citizen kind of
thing so I think yeah getting these
randomized would would definitely be
great and there's something I'll
probably do off-camera when I get back
to work new brush and confirmed I'm
nipping and being placing books sign me
up
so we got all the tags we need what
we're missing is a lair now because
we're we're still hijacking Floor Store
comm 3x2 and it's not those dimensions
at all so what we can do is create a new
layer we know it's a floral and store
calm and it is to buy zero seven five
and then this will be a new kind of
parent layer for all the different types
common storage modules that are 2 7 2 by
0 75 so you can see within these and
might be yeah there's two
two different elements that fit those
metrics as well at the moment we're just
gonna have this one that fits this
metric but we still need the layer for
it so we're going to copy this name and
create a new layer or one need to track
that in and what we're gonna do is grab
everything here and throw it in that
layer we just made it should be good and
then we're gonna get the trusty
procedural element tool out and we want
to create an element prefab from this
let me just select an existing layer sir
okay well I'll have to do it manually so
I wanna honor that's right chat is
debating why books even exist in hundred
and forty years in the future that
that's a that's a question for
philosophers and Dave haddock
well people still collect vinyls to
these days who knows what people are
still keeping around it might be a full
circle and finals might become the new
thing like blu-ray to DVD so we're going
to assign this this layer to the prefab
library with a click of a button
great we can just double check this for
our sanity that it in fact came in to
come to a prop library floor aligned
storage common I need to refresh the
library demo or aligned storage come in
I don't think it came in
it might not like that zero in there so
we're just gonna round it up to two one
yep and what we're missing is probably
why I didn't save it is we're missing a
prefab pivot I was just going to say
that and we will not align it to this
input box 2x1 everyone what's the
correct layer prefab pivot is so that
when it gets brought in one of the one
of the variables is the pivot angle that
can be out so that not everything is at
a straight 90-degree angle every time
right yep correct
you thought I was joking what I was
being serious
I don't think I got these on the right
layer either 2x1 store coming still
coming in that's right
I'm just selecting a different layer
that's already exported to the prop
library so I can get this ball path
automatically instead of manually
looking for it yep no red text they were
good
let's check the database one more time
Chiqui refresh 2x1 great so if I drag
this in great we've got a procedural
element now so that should be all we
need from this level so we can jump back
over to here let's go on our overlay
because we want to change this up a bit
and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna bring
in that element that prop just side by
side for now so I can make sure that the
size and the tags are correct when I
when I modify this one bring this over
so you can see I'm just doing that the
same thing just but in this editor
instead storage common to buy alarm so
bring it in here and like this is a good
kind of validation way as well so we can
chuck it up here we can rewrite I mean I
would say though that this doesn't fit
but for the sake of the demo it could be
like yeah yeah that works there so
that's great so we're gonna put these
side-by-side because I can see these I
can see the tags and the dimensions it's
looking for and we're gonna get it to
spawn in here I mean it's always gonna
spawn this one in because we've only got
one on that but we could do something
else that's not as cool but we can lower
this born chance of this coming in to
quite low all we can see actually can we
get this to spawn in over here that's
the minimum dimensions okay we're gonna
lower the minimum dimensions here and
add storage if I do this not quite sure
what will spawn in but let's try it
anyway so - I suppose we've had a lot of
luck with on this show going back to
reverse the version happier not sure
quite sure what this is going to do and
then we get a giant spider and that
dude's genitalia that happened it
happens I'm not proud of it but it
happened so we're pretty much telling
this volume that you can spawn anything
between these I sure didn't need to
change the minimum did I no lower is
better so if it can fit within this
volume and it's bigger than this
internal volume it will spawn it in but
we can see is that the right tank
storage floor align oh cool
so I didn't need to add any more tags
but what I can do is I can add a
different like sub set of tags which
would be kind of like an end or
statement so either look for storage of
lower lined or maybe look for bending
floor lines so we can kind of do an
either/or like either spawn in storage
or a vending machine I don't care this
this point and it kind of you can kind
of narrow it down so it's less arbitrary
than just floor lined
I just want anything to spawn here but
you know you kind of know that you know
this is a communal space so maybe don't
do storage bar I don't mind if it's a
vending or a seat because they're the
kind of elements you'd see in a more
commercial space somebody see it
somewhere for people to drink as well so
we've got that control over that as well
so we don't need that that guy anymore
what we can do is just cycle through
this
test what's coming in my database didn't
spawning the way this might take a few
spins usually a random system so truly
random but as long as we made there's
the you know the tags lined up and their
sizes lineup as well just clicking it
this is literally the last thing we'll
be doing on the show so as we've already
hit time so sure maybe it'll be
appropriately funny if just want to make
sure we'll just keep those tags say on
star citizen live game dev we show you
the behind the scenes look at the true
real to life process of the game
developer and Wow sometimes it's it's
something you know flashy like creating
a new character concept other times it's
just as important stuff like creating
this procedural systems that will be the
foundation for the future of space
stations throughout the game and so
don't you push a button and you push a
button and you push a button it still
doesn't do what you want it to do
so I'm just going to get a couple of
these randomly generating at once so we
can start seeing a couple get through
the you know the random seeds a lot
quicker I'll see if I can get my shelf
to spawn in
so now now I'm thinking I should have
probably spawned in by now so and
possibly an error I'm doing on my end
it's alright Emily let me just remove
the preview
at the very least if this doesn't work
let's go back to the original layer and
just show the folks that have joined
since the beginning the show how the
entire layer can spawn in one way we can
debug with a lot this is spawning
incorrectly is we sit up the sizes to a
tee so we we go where's this two by
seven five to seven five three point
seven five to five and we said that the
mental that this as well so now we're
only gonna get something that fits
within this so we're going to start
seeing a lot less of it other props so
floor align storage its utilitarian just
check my default tags yep and now I can
spawn this and I can kind of see the the
console will spit out at me okay so it's
boarding now so we just have to be a bit
more specific with the size I guess so
we're just for simplicity because I know
we're gonna wrap up I'll just drop that
random chance
I talked about - lets go point seven so
don't want to sit here forever trying to
get it to spoil a lot to not spawn and
are we on yep so we're on overlay C and
I just need to quickly explore this back
out into the prefab library so that so
the library is updated and I can turn
off see actually I kind of
underestimated how quickly I could
probably preview this because now I've
got a one in three chance of spawning in
the overlay that I put the Shelf in and
then appoint a chance of actually seeing
the shelf but you know all your dances
sometimes you just gotta believe that
you have joined us since the beginning
of the show this is a one-click
procedural generation button for all the
elements that are in this space station
room and you got it on the first track
all that first first try I see people in
the chat must have been believing so we
did it let's do a couple more
generations before we will have people
go just because we showed this stuff at
the beginning and there folks who may
not have been here at the beginning see
it so we click a procedural generation
button reads all the tags that are laid
they're laid out throughout the this
particular room and does a whole nother
there's a whole nother layout with
different lighting with different
environment problems oh we didn't show
there the the the dynamic environment
probes
ok katachi look briefly replicas they do
have to let you go yeah we're we're on
our camera yeah I'll talk over that
while I chart different uni room because
we've seen over five a lot and I don't
want to get people to let people down
and to think we're just kind of changing
one room up a tiny little bit we're
actually working on you know we have the
chance of spawning in five different uni
rooms instead of one so we can just do
the same thing on a completely different
room so yeah you know real time probes
is something that kind of makes this
possible because previously we we baked
our probes and they'll static food they
would belong to a certain lighting setup
so if we if we brought in red lights on
a probe that was baked for green lights
we would see red lights but kind of
green reflections right
that would really make much sense but
[Music]
because of real-time probes now means we
can change up the lighting so whatever
we want really got some stuff spawning
in odd spots yeah you know I got too
many previews and then you know the
lighting changes dynamically so now we
can we can do a lot wider changes in
terms of lighting and stuff like that as
well for the environment probes are
basically the image in the easy kind of
a layman's sense you can have you can
have red lights you have blue eyes you
have green lights and whatnot but the
environment probes are how are determine
how those lights react with the
environment for lack of a better term
and they could they it's all the
environmental factors that are there
that can affect it make it look but make
it look more greenish like you was
talking about it's a big part of why
sometimes your your spaceship looks a
completely different color in one
location versus another location just
like it doesn't realize and before they
had to bake those in that they had to
like create in each and each environment
probe individually for each location but
now they're dynamic that's so much more
freeing
I'm just trying a different is it
Universal room
but something came in oh very might be
dying
yeah for some reason I was dying but
yeah this we can run it a few times on
on this level as well see what we get
[Music]
totally different changes and it's not
just the props that are changing the
entire atmosphere yeah we can specify on
volumes as well you know whether or not
they met you know warmish lights or cool
lights so we can we have that finite
control over like the mood in a room as
well so we're not seeing kind of like in
color theory you can have two calls that
don't go together and you know that's
another kind of control we have on it so
we're not putting you know blue and red
lights right next to each other and
creating like like jarring visuals you
know we can put lights that work well
together with other lots that work well
together right well I don't want to keep
you trapped here like these three dudes
are here so you go ahead and switch back
to your camera here we'll wrap things up
Joel thank you so much for taking the
time out of at the end of your week it's
always you know these are always at the
end of everybody's week they're always
at the end of Fridays especially when
they're into it from the UK me here I'm
just starting my Friday I still got a
whole day of work left to do but you you
get to finish up and go home so thank
you for staying late thank you for
taking the time to show us your process
to explore just a little of what goes
into these modular space station
interiors of course these are currently
in development as part of our ongoing
work to build out not just to spent the
stanton system but star citizen in
general so Joel thank you so much i'ma
let you go guys remember there's an
episode of pillow talk coming out later
today I don't entirely know when because
I've been in here doing this for last
hour so that's going straight to YouTube
keep an eye out for that as well as
updates to the public roadmap and we'll
be back here next week with
with another episode of star citizen
line so thanks that's watching Tigger
thanks for watching for the latest and
greatest in star citizen a squadron 42
