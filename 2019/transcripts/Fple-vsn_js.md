[Music]
do you have any sevens Go Fish
no hey everybody welcome to another
episode of reverse the verse live this
time focused on the facial customization
the character customization team system
and we are here with just some of the
team members who have worked on bringing
this if I can say so as an outside
observer amazing system online let's go
around the tables introduce yourselves
tell everybody who you are and what you
do for the facial system and what you do
for starters in general so we can kind
of cater the questions that come in a
can let's start with you we haven't had
you on the show no my name is Kay
Letourneau
I am the senior systems designer here
and mostly what I do is fidget and make
a mess in the office but on the
character customizer I was doing a lot
of the R&D for how our design would
shape up and turning this relatively
actually quite novel system into
something usable and
and that's what I'm getting possible
yeah you gotta you gotta crack it if you
don't rock it you can't use it stare
point it's very nice see so much so a
lot of your work I focused on the front
end they the user experience making this
we showed in your demo on a TV last week
the the way our devs use the tool and
then your work a lot of your work was on
making it player phasing yeah cuz I
wanted it it was really important for it
to be useful to someone who doesn't know
the intricacies of how it works and also
like there are elements of how it works
now like using on the dev side that are
just annoying and like trying trying to
overcome those like tuna to an extent
while the players are my focus because
that's people we want to use it the most
I mean I want to make Shawn's life
better I want him to be able to get in
there and like make NPCs and make them
all like pretty and
like they would speak to him he's lonely
my life it's better when your estimates
go from this to this that's just do that
just say five days Naz two days it's two
days my life will be for you soon yeah
what you do for his choices and in the
character customer hey I'm Spencer
Johnson associate gameplay engineer been
working with calyx this quarter on the
user facing and user experience side of
the customizer all the programming to
back up the UI so things like the
sliders locking the the transitions
between the steps and the facial editing
but yeah all the the user experience
side of things not so much the animation
and actually the blending between the
faces but how do you as a players
interact with the system and make your
own character and Sean last week we had
Chris Farrar was the janitor on the show
tell us who you are and what you do for
starters I'm Chris is the jannah' I
guess I'm the I'm like the janitor
assistant or like the janitors yeah
like the cleaner then okay yeah so
anyways tech director of content we
developed the backend system with the
the the engine guys and then directed
the the feature going to the feature
team which is where Spencer and Kayla
statement now at the end I want to make
sure that we give that whatever that we
we remind everybody that at the end of
the 87th we did some a little usual we
had a title card with a special thanks
to a whole litany of people this is
assist I think that's important it
actually uh you know like I guess
marketed without you because the first
time as I did it right we did during the
ATV segment anyways I was trying to just
rattle off the names off the top of my
head and and that that that goes awful
every time because you always I don't
forget one or the other and it's not
that you don't care instead you just
thinking in that moment right you don't
remember I wanted to get it everything
correct for everybody but yeah we should
do that with all the features but as far
as I'm concerned because usually like
they see one person talking about the
feature but it's coming from like you
know in in this case probably ten or
eleven people at at different points in
time so it's not like
you know ten or eleven of us we're all
working on this edge of all at the same
time and everything but it was like you
know Dean or sorry the facial
customisation stuff has been progressing
over the course of truly the you know
two to three years and this is all
happening behind the scenes it's how we
drive our facial system it's always been
and what's super interesting about this
was this was in septage you know four or
five years ago when he initially got our
head deliveries started working with
three lateral I did all this that we had
expected fully to do this system
individuality what we didn't expect was
well we expected challenges but we
didn't expect that it would end up in a
coma for about a year with a problem
that we just we just could not solve we
just couldn't get past it
but we're gonna know luckily at the
attachment problem so the attachment
problem heads G is so ministry
interesting to talk about and it's it's
it's not the first thing you'd think
about within this but you know and maybe
we'll talk some body customization
questions earlier because that's what
the big challenge is but then there's
the attachments so so morphing a face
and doing all these things is complex
enough but then when you tack on
attachments to it so now you've got hair
now you've got scalps now even though
glasses now you've got helmets now
you've got multiples now you've got top
hats now you've got you know all these
kind of things you have to make sure
that those still fit every single face
that you can have and like like we
showed in a TV there's a huge range of
of human anatomy and generally you know
that's why they have multiple sizes of
hats that's why they have multiple sizes
of helmets that's why but guess what we
can't make that we can't I can't go to
jog and say cool you got this awesome
idea for I don't look great give me 30
of those right with just you know slight
adjustments to every single one so we
needed a much more dynamic system now we
can put those in our shops we could have
a size one a helmet a size two helmet
well yeah but then you could only get a
hat shop you would have a helmet shop
you would have it you know all these
things so we needed to make sure that we
could implement a system that could
adapt the the shape of the attachments
to fit base
so that's what we did when Andres Rourke
came on last year who did part of the
demonstration there it says is gone he
was the one to kind of crack the case on
this which was using some concepts on a
to to be fair from the film side that he
had done most of the work within but
then applying them to a runtime
implementation so these were all these
new deformers that we've created that a
runtime deformers so you know we call
one at last everyone is non-uniform
scaling and these are these are
deformers are a method of moving verts
around or deforming them obviously at
runtime based on some sort of input and
the input is the phase right now what
gets weird about it is there's different
to former types for different types of
attachments and you know Ivana andreas
went through this really well in their
presentation but you know certain the
certain the elastic type basically this
is one that follows pervert the offsets
for every single part against every
other Verdun the attachment wouldn't
work on a helmet because the whole thing
would contort into such a weird shape
that you wouldn't be able to recognize
that helmet anymore so yeah it was
really important to bring those those
those those deformers online so that we
could actually roll the system out and
that's why there was a big big delay
within it you're still using the system
behind the scenes but we couldn't apply
it or give it to the players without
something the attachment problem all
right now we are here taking questions
live from the chat you can suite your
questions into play places either in the
twitch chat where you can preface your
question with the word question and
capital letter surrounded by brackets or
do the same thing in spectrum which is
our bespoke communication platform
available in Robert's bass industries
com
in addition we did put up a thread all
week and collect questions for those who
maybe couldn't be here live and also let
our community vote them up so I want to
go in and start into some of the most
voted up questions some of these didn't
really apply what we're talking about
you know facial customization and some
of them we're talking about you know
things will but but further down the
road like like tattoos and and stuff
like that we're not ready to go into
that just yet but the by far the most
prevalent question was age
where are we what aren't thinking about
a dreams I mean are we gonna be able to
have 70 year old people 20 year old
people so the short answer is is yes but
not exactly as you're asking for it so
you know we're not gonna have I just
don't want to do it in such an overt way
where it's like oh what's your age and
then you just have this slider and then
eventually it sort of just adjusts the
face what I prefer is that there was
different levels of basically different
variants to the skin tone so like for
example you might have that pretty
standard Caucasian sort of skin tone but
I'd like to see and I know Chris wants
to see this an old version of it a
younger version of it a sun-damaged
version of it a a scart version of it or
you know basically variations within
those tones so that you can basically
get that sort of result but whether
you're setting yourself to a
seven-year-old because I've seen you
know anyway 67 year olds that look young
you know what I mean so I think it
implies a lot that that oh you're 70 so
you're gonna have you know you know
liver spots or something like this and
that's not a guarantee but I prefer that
we had variants within the skin tones
and making those is not a nightmare by
any stretch of the imagination so
because we're kind of an a data-driven
setup now we can add those as as we need
it's interesting because if we bring up
a good point
you know I remember my grandparents
growing up they always seem so old
yeah I'm sorry they know it's just it
just the aging has changed in just the
last 50 years here on earth it's the the
way that 70 year olds looked 50 years
ago versus the way 70 year olds look now
that's true is different you know and
and when you extrapolate that nine
hundred and forty years in the future
sure you know seven you know we could
the seven year old could look like us
yeah I want to run around like a jacked
70 year old in the verse I guess like
Jack LaLanne yeah like this hair like
totally gray and like 40 ABS like that's
cool yeah I'm glad you mentioned that
hair we need to get this hair yeah we
should we should we got to talk to Josh
they're gonna make it happen I'm just
not sure we could handle the poly
counter that
banister oh it's the physics simulation
that I'm really in can ya look at it I
mean honestly if you want to stress the
character creator you do his hair and my
3.0 beard with all the color and
everything because I could never do that
here look if you can get that combo
going you anything there's 20 different
colors you get my 3.0 beard his hair if
you can get that combo doing you can do
anything the character combined no noted
am I not right character Voltron right
all right
which leads us into our next questions
what are their plans for long hair and
helmets are you guys working on long
hair tech yes but first we have to okay
so here steak let's talk here let's talk
here
okay hair is hard hair is really hard
and not just hard for me it's a hard
real-time rendering hair is very
difficult right and and to be fair
nobody's really solved it in in a new or
unique way for the last let's say 10 or
10 years it all uses alpha cards and
whether you use alpha test or awful
blend but there's there's plus or
minuses to the whole thing and I don't
know how deep it like or what's it like
the difference between an alpha Blender
and alpha test I would go a little bit
and so the difference between alpha
blending of the tests you have a card
you have an alpha Channel that's
basically saying this is transparent
here not transparent here alpha test
only does a singular test of that and it
says is this pixel basically is this
vert gonna render or not is this pixel
here or not and it does one check and it
goes through or it doesn't go through
alpha blend does multiple right it
actually blends it rather than doing
just a test against the singular pixel
so when you make alpha blend on a bunch
of the hair cards the the the softness
of the hair can look amazing the problem
is is performance changes depending on
the distance that you are so how much of
the screen space alpha blend actually
takes up so it's a bit of a red or
anything so we showed it citizen pretty
much an update to not only the hair
shader but the method that we make that
right so this has not at all been
applied to the the current character
great so that's step one is take those
hairstyles that are there now and make
sure that they're using the updated
shader and the updated pipeline so that
they're all going to look they're all
gonna look a lot better we also had to
update it to unify them so that we could
have them on all of our different head
shapes and all that different characters
and and make the attachment system work
for that so they they use that elastic
sort of technique the trick is getting
it simulating definitely on top of that
so once we've got the visuals where we
want it then we'll then we'll get into
the simulation side of it and that has
to do with the complexity of these
attachments so now think of think of how
this works so we have this hair we have
an adaptable face and we have this
runtime to former that contorts the hair
to fit and it's not like just a uniform
scale thing it's you know we can move
the scalp so we can move all of all of
the all of the areas of the head that
your positions move so the hair has to
move up and down and now adjoint chains
into that because generally you're gonna
want to simulate these things with
either joint chains or some sort of
cloth vertex simulation or you go crazy
and you go you know tress-fx end video
you want the paired of things right but
all those systems use some form of
vertex simulation to some degree pipe
down onto the GPU so whether we want to
implement that that's probably a bit
further than we'll go but on the joint
chain technique we need to be able to we
need to be able to update the offsets of
their joint change so that the
simulation happens from the right place
all the time depending on the depending
on the attachment changing from the
constraints and the constraints exactly
I have a question for you the the
blending that that we that we're doing
on these items on these attachments that
hair is a part of are we able to do that
multiple steps or is it just the one
step for it for like my head is this
shape so my hair has to attach to that
but if I put on a beanie or whatever are
we able to then like also clamp it on
the secondary step or is that
problematic that's a bit problematic and
I know what I know what you're saying so
what we do instead we do sub geometries
that's basically like different forms of
that geometry depending on what
attachment is a great example of this is
the current Snoopy cap so basically and
we finally fixed this thing well kind of
it's coming that bugs absolutely perfect
this was a fun one
so everybody's seen it I'm sure you've
got Mohawk sticking through helmets
you've got although now that we have
long hair it's more like the rule than
than it was before it's it's it's it
used to just be the exception the one
hair the Mohawk would always go through
the helmet great we had set up a bunch
of logic but there was a Koch bug within
here that the tank wasn't being
respected so basically what we do with
the Snoopy cap if your hair is so long
that it would clip through the helmet we
instead put a Snoopy cap on the hair but
that's all adapted based on what hair
you have so when the helmet comes on
just to go to your point of like putting
on a beanie and change again we do this
with the Snoopy cap so when the helmet
goes on if the hair is so long that it
would clip we put this new P cap on you
because of the way we do that with the
sub G Oh change we don't necessarily
have to pick the same Snoopy cap exactly
every hair we can't have like that whole
like totally hair sticking out the
bottom of it sure whatever else and
that's all just asset work and generally
you know with character team you know I
talked to Corey a lot of time about it
would he calls hat hair so it's
basically like you know when you put a
helmet on what's your hair looked like
when you put a hat on what's your hair
look like and it's just how many of
those they actually want to make and you
know for every single hairstyle if you
now have to make you know I had hair
version a helmet hair version that's
already multiplied it by two you know
are three anyways the three different
forms of each hairstyle and then you've
got yeah you just don't wanna make so
much complexity for the for them anyways
space behaves well yeah it's kind of
ingress gonna be captain beanie where
you still have I'm just not sure what
shopping be in if it is well yeah I
think we have them and I think I feel
like I've seen what I'm imagining is
like Pacheco's hair but then you
a hat on top but the dreads are still we
need to like tennis visor yeah but but
again Alejo again wear that look like in
a helmet because you've got Dre okay
cool you put on a helmet and you've got
dreads hanging down here what's that
look like in a helmet like actually what
would that look like and you know what
that would look like and it'd be really
weird right like I mean you have this
bunched up stuff you know in your helmet
so it's a bit I realize if I'm wavy and
put that Snoopy cap on and the you know
that volume of hair just kind of goes
away like I don't know if you could fit
that into a Snoopy cap what you got this
is what it's actually doing see talking
though anytime I judge your hair is I
got I can't say I can't say anyway yeah
so so yeah I guess short answer is yes
that's what it sounds like to me yeah
cool I know folks in the chat we're
asking about well they have the ability
to create their own hairstyles and I was
something like everything we just talked
about oh man like okay that's oh yeah
and I don't have a rigid plan for this
but like we've all seen it when we were
starting on the character creator we all
took a little look at all the you know
there's a million of them but one of the
best ones not overall character creation
but for hair specifically is black
desert online like those guys and I
think I have a pretty good idea how
they're doing it but I need to solve our
joint offset problem the first with the
with the attachments but I love that you
get control strands within their hair
styles this is super cool because then
it it's one of these like 10x things
like if we can make it so that we're
only having 10 to 20 hairstyles and
basically the players can modify them to
give them the kind of style that they
want or or tweak to the style it's gonna
save our content creators a ton of work
right if we can get such a system online
and I think if the black desert online
one is actually very intuitive because
how it worked how it how will you see it
anyways you put the hair cell on you've
got all these control strands kind of
coming off it and you can adjust those
control strands you know individually
and I think that's super cool
I'd love to do something like this but
it's not right now laid out in the plan
as an absolute
do one of the questions that came in
from the chat says is the face model
shown in the customizer the same tear
and quality is what they're going to
have in the game that's it that's
identical to your character in the game
actually we use exactly the same data
exactly the same and actually what's
interesting is those are tier two tier
one it's pretty silly the same thing you
know so yeah and our whole intent is
that those heads need to be able to
stand in the same scene as Bishop or
captain white or anybody like that and
speak to them and there not be any real
massive texture chakra quality aldia's
quality difference between them as an
extension of the harem head question
facial hair
beard deformity is a good thing but the
helmets is yes it already works um we
even showed it in the in the citizencon
demonstration with Yvonne Andreas we
should we show there specifically
captive white beard the tricky part is
we just don't have many beards right now
that's all it's just content so those
aspects what was so interesting about
the whole deformer thing too is what I
expected to be the hardest in making
these runtime attachments and formers
actually ended up being neediest the
easiest and the stuff I thought was
gonna be the easiest ended up being the
hardest so the helmets I thought were
gonna be the easy one but we just gotta
scale them whatever that was way harder
than I thought um but the beards and
hair typically like things that touch
the face are super hard to deal with
just because you've got blend shapes in
there you've got all kinds of stuff
going on that you can't just skim to
because you've got different topology
and so but the elastic performance the
same ones we use for the hair is
actually the simplest ones for us to
make so what it means is that every
single firt that moves around will move
that same attachment so as he speaks and
everything so we get much much better
results even with this attachment stuff
than we had ever before because it was
just skinning and actually even though
you might not have noticed even in the
early squadron sort of videos and
vertical slice stuff if blood shapes
will clip through the beard and stuff
like this you kind of didn't notice cuz
we try to hide it a little bit but this
is more so much better for that
so making beards is actually
much easier than it ever was before
what's also nice about that is there's
other things like beards that that go
across your face so if you can think of
you know like a banded bandana type
thing right around your face that
totally works and you can see the
speaking happening below it which is
just incredible to me that that's it
that's not an easy thing to pull off
doctors mask is another one that I write
to see which is the exact same thing and
it's actually those ones are so that my
internal demo exactly like I showed that
Internet demo that that it all moves
around and what's cool about doctors
mask too is it's got the instructions
sort of loops that go back around the
ears and because of the way the
deformity work as the ears move around
that whole strap stuff moves around so
it just makes you know having the
singular asset mark it up one time and
it works for everybody good let's get to
some of the things that are in there
folks have been asking if we're gonna be
able to save our current look in the
editor so that you know they can find a
look and then if they want to play with
it you know change it and end up messing
it up can't quite get back they could
they can go back to a safe preset when
planning for improvements for this next
quarter and like having concept like and
I'll do history and stuff like that
definitely on the radar I think
depending on what's the level of undo we
want to do I think we're talking about
having like an undo stack right so what
we do is just save off all the DNA
values which is actually a really small
set of data it's like 200 bytes we
exposed DNA yeah it's a string of
characters that's like yeah the matrix
oh really short string of characters so
much the complexity comes from the fact
that we have all these these different
types of modifications we have changing
the DNA deformer as well as changing the
actual items that are attached and
that's that's when it starts to get a
little bit more complicated in terms of
how we're going to manage that history
yeah because actually all these like you
know the I Donna me stuff that we have
right now for hair or I seem to be beard
and stuff is actually a totally separate
than DNA this is actually an item being
attached to you so we need to have this
you know history of your changes be sort
of agnostic to the data that you changed
like okay if you had a DNA we need to
say here's the value refer to that value
of DNA matrix if you had an attachment
it's like okay well what I'd important
what was there and the more the smarter
the system can be about that the better
we can have it update like if if we
don't have any idea what the change was
and we just say okay here's the last
state it was in where we have to we have
to reinitialize the entire character
he's gonna pop off screen for a second
and then come back on yeah it's just a
way worse experience and now you've
forgotten like you don't get to see the
actual change happen so you can judge it
yeah so you have to just hold more of it
in your head at a given time so making
it smarter is worth doing because
that'll make it a lot more usable yeah I
think so dude that main point is there's
there's two different data well there's
a couple data sets in hearing them
mainland is yeah kind of like the
anatomy the shape G oh yeah like how how
the colors are being attached all the
tiers are being a touch exactly that's
totally like this tiny matrix so like I
know I made the joke in the ATV was like
oh I see blood ever see Burnett actually
that dad is not in there so you can lied
to us so we have the DNA matrix for the
anatomy and now we need some string for
the ID on sort of data to represent what
hair style what what color what skin
tone color I think you just wanted to
say that out loud
I got ID on him yeah yeah so yeah I
heard good yeah there was another one
you said today but heterochromia yeah we
might want to skip to that question
because we're gonna talk about words
won't get the best out of your federal
chromia the biggest words gotta say the
biggest words of the end you know keep
people watching I'm sorry everybody I
think over the farms or anybody's played
a game like the WWE 2k what not nut nose
when you the Creator wrestlers is a
major feature there and one of the
things you do is you can sort of they
have to do it manually but there's a
numerical value for everything so they
so players export a code it's like here
is my combination for this character yes
so I so they've made if they've made a
person that they're like haven't
recreated a famous person or whatever
they want to give it to somebody else
they can do it if you make a character
and you want to roleplay as his twin you
could give him the code and he could
make his character I was I was really
hoping Orin that was gonna lead to you
asking if you can have a custom entrance
with our character customizer Noise
music yeah so quite the question is have
we considered not just saving things
beyond presets and views but actually
exposing that that full combinations
that players can give that combination
of the people's like another you could
be my sister in addition to it being
useful I think that there's something
that's really beautiful about anytime we
expose the data in our game because for
once we don't have to fake it we have so
much going on in this game that we can
just here's the actual values of it have
have that represented on screen in any
number of ways and I think that it's
very easy to end up with something
that's kind of beautiful and engaging
just on the data side of it like you
know in so many and so many things
you'll have like the doctors you know
panel or whatever they're manipulating
all these aspects of it and it's all
just you know and wavy em it looks nice
but it doesn't mean anything
yeah and here like it's actually tied to
something that's real and you know
sometimes that thing that's real is
still like abstracted away like the way
that we do our blending but even just
having my manipulation of the world
result in actual changes to it I always
find that compelling yeah especially as
a programmer like I love you can
actually like when the data is written
in hex like it doesn't take too much of
a leap to say like oh I can actually
look at this and see what it means like
oh like this head has this much weight
in the face like I can look at it and
actually you know it doesn't take too
much actually
explaining to say like okay this is what
it means I really see what this code is
doing no I know which I do think it's
cool why I make that matrix joke because
there is like you know no you're looking
at a yo the 1099
yes playing it at 20% and so like I
totally wanted to have like a copy to
clipboard function that we could have so
you just paste it be like this my dude
you want to like tweak it you think I
have two big ears here's the guy I make
sure and especially since we reset them
every kind of major release right now I
think that's a nice way to bring it back
but one big point about it is and and it
is what we're doing right now is you'll
see it on the next roadmap publish but
we have a v2 planned we've got lots of
iteration to the actual UI the actual
interface we've been talking about it a
lot this week
anyways taking the feedback from people
and everything so don't want to go too
deep into it cuz I'm sure we'll do an
ATV about it or something like that
about the next iteration of it but the
whole the whole mentality around that is
is simplify some of the interface a
little bit make it a little easier to
get to what you want yeah take up a
little more screen space try to make
things are more clear but the point
being is that we're gonna change them
the content that is in there so one of
the things about being at able to output
that string would be between releases if
we change that content that strings
gonna meet something very different all
of a sudden because our indices are
gonna change the amount of heads are
gonna change the hairstyle is gonna
change so unless we're very additive in
the way that we add the the indexes
we're always gonna basically clobber
that that data so once we're in a state
that we're actually pretty solid on our
data and that would be a better time to
do it but it can also have an internal
mapping to where we try our best to
future-proof it and say if we're gonna
change the order stuff it won't break it
exactly so for the next release it knows
okay well if they and are importing data
that ID one is actually for
or you know whatever whatever we want to
do with that but yeah maybe that's a
good time to talk about some of the some
of the hybrid approach stuff that were
we're looking at for for v2 so but what
I'm just I'm just gonna keep talking
about forget the question go right by
talking I mean you could take a break
just go for smoke
okay so hybrids so what's super
interesting about the hybrids and what
do I mean by having hybrid is a
resulting head that we can reuse as a
source head again
so the idea with this we're kind of
started was what we found when using it
and this was over the course of the last
years anyways what I found when using it
is that you know a lot of people there's
a lot of redundancy within faces within
heads and you probably even notice it
right now that basically we've got that
we've got nine male nine female within
the system right now but of those for
example on the female side there's
probably four of them are mostly the
same they're they're very close to the
to the same let's say archetype right so
there's some redundancy within there and
it definitely what's interesting to see
about it is it makes the average head
that people end up creating look a
little heavier on the on the sort of
asian Eastern European kind of side
right what that no that's exactly right
yeah it's like a lot of people kind of
look like that and a lot of that has to
do with just the source heads themselves
right so what we did in this early
iteration because we didn't want to make
this thing wait until halfway through
this year we wanted to get this in front
of players the main reason was we wanted
to get that feedback because like we use
it all the time but they are interacting
with it is so key to the actual feature
that just seeing the results isn't
sufficient yeah exactly so and you know
I'll go off on a cosign we'll make sure
we do the cosine tangent will then come
back for cosine comes back yeah yeah
yeah it comes back right anyways so to
make this a cosine the the heads within
there have some redundancy so what we
want to do instead is make each each
piece of data that you are that you are
sourcing be meaningful in its own way so
that there's no redundancy in there but
again we didn't want to wait until
halfway through this year to get it in
front of players to get that sort of
feedback on on on using the system so
what we're gonna be doing over this next
v2 thing is what we've done is across
all the squadron heads at everybody and
there's so many benefits of doing it
this way we've we've archetype tall the
head so there's a huge Maya scene that
basically has every single face that
we've got and what we've done is kind of
align all the people into their own
archetypes so you know to use an example
that I'm almost scared to use oh but but
sandy and Rhona Mitra have a very
similar archetype of a you know face
they have an archetype but then between
the two there might be unique features
of each so what we're gonna do within
the data sets is instead of just the
nine male and nine female that you had
you know for the last years since the
first you know character creator is that
it will replace all of those with our
hybrids of meaningful data sets so we'll
take the unique air of that guy the
unique nose of that guy the unique brow
of that guy all within the same
archetype group and make that a single
head so yeah we're distilling it to the
extremes so that you can pick between a
full yet exactly meaningful data so we
don't have redundancy across it so what
it does is it makes it a lot easier to
use because each of the each of the
sorts that each of the data sources are
unique in their own way and you don't
have a lot of redundancy kind of sort
between and and this doesn't mean that
we're only gonna have you know four or
five head even within that archetype and
hybrid approach the reason we can do
this is that I can take very specific
features of you know maybe an actor that
we can't use the full likeness of and
create that into a hybrid and that's
actually not an issue at all we make
we're making people that aren't actually
two people but are combinations of
people so basically we're combining
we're using our own system to source our
system which makes some sense the other
cool part about that is because we're
gonna have this ability it does make a
pipeline for us making you guys
admission givers our new heads a little
bit easier but what's really cool about
it I think is it is an interesting
design idea that we're
trying to flesh out between myself and
Todd and CR it's the I call it the
loopback or the feedback pipeline or the
sins of a father kind of idea this is
yeah the legacy or your errand looming
or something like this whereas if you
create a character and within death of a
spaceman after you've died a certain
amount of times or whatever you can't
respawn and you have to create a new
character but I would love to be able to
then source back my original character
as as a source head now within the pool
and this is totally possible because
again it exists as a combination of
those those hex values we feed it back
in as a source and then we blend against
it now you can only do that so many
times because eventually you will just
end up back at the average you know it's
going to just keep blending blending
blending blending blending brother
you'll just end up back to the average
all the time but I like the option for
that for four characters to do that so I
like this concept of you know if you
were playing the game as a criminal or
something like this you've got a certain
amount of reputation that when you roll
your next character if he's kind of you
know quote-unquote this son or your
child I like this idea that some of that
reputation comes with you because yeah
if your dad's a horrible criminal maybe
you start life as a bit of a you know
with a little bit of that right and and
you have to work against it or if you
just want to make something anew but I
love the idea of being able to source
back the the player head so we do and
I'm sorry good we're doing where we
could like source from different people
to like other players like like your
help and somebody my pool because you
know so certain reason so that kind of
goes to the to the copy/paste of the
data right so we could absolutely do
that because if you could share the data
between players you could feed that back
into your pool but one of the ideas that
came up over this and by the way a lot
of this is theory crafting still there's
a none I don't have a plan for that
hybrids are in that's happening this
quarter but the the sins of a father
kind of thing is a middle yeah we're
exploring all the potentials consequence
in ways we can really leverage it right
so so we've talked about possibly having
like like the gene pool or that the head
pool basically controlled via two org so
for example the
could expose all the heads although the
characters that they have within their
organs as sourcing so if the org just I
don't know it's a dangerous road to
tread Doughboy you just want everybody
looking a certain way or looking a
certain type is I mean might be I'd be
able to get but it's also like sort of
element of family or whatever you have
do it just things to think about
I don't know people spending time
together I like the bigger nose org yeah
I like the idea of like dominant trait
sticking around like what if I have a
player that has this massive crook nose
and I just never die or whatever and
eventually like it's guys like a hundred
or whatever like trace stick around the
gene pool because uh killings there's a
dangerous conversation there no I know
I'm just a voting going down there yeah
mm-hmm
using opinions of everyone at this table
they don't represent those a cladogram
games Roberts face in the streets or I'm
not diving in there whatsoever what's up
but that is an idea that has been
expressed that that Forks could share
individually within there
heterochromia it's actually the next
question that came up here that's what
it is it's about having different
colored eyes and as far as the asset
side of it I don't see a reason we
couldn't support it I don't think that
we do I haven't heard of any plans to do
so how do you feel about this John uh I
loved the word again I'm just like
different eye colors you're like it's
it's a pretty it's a pretty rare and I'm
like their color and the whole this is
like I Donna me what's a dog for an
anime yeah especially animals and anime
animals and orders and education anime
yeah uh you guys are freaking nerds I
feel like we already support blade
symmetry so they would just be like
locking one island that asymmetry thing
- yeah I mean actually the the helmet
thing was a big part of that asymmetry
decision because we supported asymmetry
like manipulating your your face just
directly asymmetry and that was a
problematic because you can
even if you end up with a non humonculon
character you still end up with a one
that when the helmet morphs to match
your face
it's the helmet symmetry becomes the
asymmetry in the helmet becomes really
apparent and problematic yeah it's a
really polite way to put it it looks
awful right like I mean the bulbous you
know thing yeah you have a slaver helmet
that looks like a face and then you have
half of it looking like it was melted on
the material side which is what what
supporting heterochromia would mean I
don't know if we have any anything
coming down the pipe for being able to
do any manipulations of material at men
at that scale that would be very similar
for how you would handle alterations to
eyebrows makeup yeah so much tones so we
did build this into the character system
from the get-go as an option site I
thought eventually we want this and
actually what I thought eventually we
want would be like holographic upgrades
and things like that that you and I or
contact lens on one eye that's where
they are lands or a robot eye or
something well but within the item ports
at the character it's actually split up
to left and right eye we just use this
we use one of them right now and that's
all and it has the two eyes in it so
like the easiest way to do it is
actually just to add another set of eyes
and then we zone called one or the other
yeah
so there's actually four eyes but we're
still calling the opposite ones do you
know what I mean and that totally works
right now maybe we can do it so I think
depending on how much people want yeah
sure this is it's not a not a
nightmarish add I'm holding a line for
the start and all we do is want to be
able to make cable from x-force right no
that's exactly yes Cara 1ra and then yes
yeah I mean things like scarification
and having any sort of you know post
like manipulation things like having
augmentations or anything like that yeah
prosthetics those are all would be
handled on the asset side at this point
same as like adding adding a hair which
is a weird way to do it
I'll admit like having if you'd if your
guys well know if you're adding extra
eye and are you adding a scar or
something like doesn't it doesn't
initially make sense that you would
attach that to a person but they're
probably oh yeah yeah the color is
somehow attached to the person yeah onto
that's that's the sort of like
abstraction you have to to get your head
around in order to manipulate it mm-hmm
correctly shrim so what's what's the
term again that's asking about a single
button to just randomize all yeah yes
I've never moved it on the release we
had a great forever yeah we have we had
a great out we removed it just because
and it's actually because we we didn't
want to confuse about whether or not it
would randomize the the head blending
and the I Donna me aspect because those
are just two completely different
processes and we didn't get both of them
working concurrently yeah so that that's
why that's not in there right now so we
need to get those two things to line up
nicely which actually ties into some of
the stuff that that's interesting about
for doing undo being able to manipulate
those those steps all the different
datasets yeah it with the different
datasets yeah yes just that a randomized
all and it checkmark weather allow
homunculus or not so you end up looking
like sloth from the Goonies
yeah randomize him oh good well whenever
you voted whenever Evo who is the main
you know engineer behind all of this he
loves to make some monsters I mean he
always sends a video through he said
check you know you like that like you
know there's what will be updating the
interface and evil kind of sent a video
through with the interface that he
founded likes and wants to work with and
like there's just these these monsters
they're monsters they're crazy created
yeah when somebody's no it's like is for
people's sons at one head but one on one
side one of the other it's very weird
anyways so make up we're getting a lot
of questions about the makeup yeah we
talk about just like scars or just like
you know a cybernetic what about the
ability of maybe the same tech is doing
different kind of eyebrows right
yeah that's someone and and if people
had probably noticed this anyways some
of the skin tones for the females have
makeup built into them it's so we there
was kind of this character our past that
they did to make pass basically against
all the all the heads so they added some
some eyeliner eyeshadow kind of things
but whether that's a separable thing
it's completely up to character out on
that front
um it's again not a huge nightmare to do
we have a great feature within the skin
shader to deal with it but I'm not sure
that it's gonna be perfect because the
thing we have in the skin shader is
really good for tattoos for decals for
dirt or mud or face paint basically and
the reason I say it like you know
instead of blending nearly as well
exactly and it doesn't it doesn't adapt
the specular so it's the biggest thing
that happens when you put on makeup is
is you're changing the light reactionary
so like a good example is that you know
you put powder on so that you're not as
greasy sort of looking we don't really
have that control
so if we'd put makeup in it would look
like face paint and not like makeup
because makeup changes the specular
reaction a lot of that skin so we'd have
to support that that's also right now to
have like a really good makeup it has to
be pretty much painted into the texture
itself and not a layer on top so we
would need something like that so if we
do progress on the tattoo sort of front
or or or the face being sort of front
we'll have to do something and
that way but right now we wouldn't just
put the makeup in because it would just
look like face paint and it would look
like a bunch of game developers thought
what would makeup look like oh that's
how and you know we have a choice platen
here who is a who was a beauty
specialist let's say she has podcasts
and everything so we had had her come
over a couple times and we talked
through this quite a few times and we
even showed her that the sort of detail
stuff which doesn't that's not at all
what it should look like no don't do
please don't do this so so yeah face
paint yes makeup not not not really it's
kind of built into the shader and I know
what is some of the skin tones already
have it within there many many are the
tails of video game disaster when the
developers try to design the design
looks for things that they don't fully
understand themselves absolutely like hi
Donna me like hetero which leads me to
the next question what are our chances
of seeing more hairstyles relevant to
people of color
ah that's it that's a great great
question it's it's really one for Josh
on the on the character outside I do not
know exactly what they're quarter plans
are so we're doing our quarterly
planning over there over this week
anyways so we'll know I mean next week I
guess but we won't be on the show so
hopefully mostly they've got to get all
those hairs that are in there for me if
if is my call and not really I'll talk
to Josh but but we've got to get the
hairstyles that are and they're all
updated to the new hair shader first
that's number one before we add any new
content let's make sure the concept we
have is at the highest level that it can
be and then let's add some new stuff but
if we just start adding new stuff and
the old shader is just more work that we
have to come back to so I'd rather not
do that and of course will almost
certainly have an update on that ATV
when the time comes yeah definitely
ATV you're back here in authority
definitely know once we have the new
iteration that we're that we're working
on the design for now figuring out that
new flow and breaking down how much work
it is and
and yeah how much of the how much the
quarter I have to steal from these poor
guys yeah we people show it and
chocolate let's do a follow up to
something Chris mentioned the other week
about being able to blend male and
female right now the blends are all mal
mal mal mal for males which is
oppressive or for females which is
impressive but not between males and
females to get that traditional
mom-and-pop you know thing is you
mentioned that it's something that we're
interested in something that we might
pursue down the road this person is just
asking if there's an update is this is
this a is this a neat is this as soon or
is this assume yeah it's the second one
and it's it's less about whether we want
to do it or not and it's it's more about
this this whole systems the data
management challenge
so I had mentioned you know I feel like
I'm just I'm dealing with it I'm the
only one answering questions how about
you guys take those well I uh I haven't
at least seen the face melting your you
describe yeah okay so I want to describe
that first so right now if you blended a
male and female because of the
positional differences of the of the of
the the origin join our neck joint that
we actually align when you blend a male
to a female right now it looks like it's
really creepy them to face melts into
the female yeah so I like it literally
melts I have drawn great images I mean
there's a first for pike in that episode
of Star Trek
well what's super creepy as it keeps
animating so it's like a melted talking
face and it's really whoa like you know
exactly right so there's some there's
some great images and anytime somebody
comes on a Stuart studio tour asked to
see the page the things we've seen
because wait images on it and we are
happy to show that is under NDA only
yeah so right now they melt the reason
they melt is that the offset is
different so again the females about
four inches shorter than the male the
origin position is totally different so
we don't do the blend necessarily
relative to just that origin but that's
what we could do to do that work what it
would mean though is
either taking all the data from the
female proto rig right now and adding
that to the male and then taking all the
male ones and I think that's the Frodo
ring there
but the issue I have with that is what I
talked about in a TV is the performance
winds that we got from this whole system
so like and to read to reiterate like
this is massive every all the heads in
that one proto file are cheaper than any
single one face was before so we now
have all the faces for the same cost
that a single face was before like the
difference there is incredible I don't
want to make that much worse I don't
want to I don't want to take away that
benefit that we have because as you add
more heads into that that gets bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger bigger
and if we take all the female ones we
out of its the same place now that means
every character that loads has to lose
the same sort of pool of memory but if
you're only rendering males you're only
gonna have you know that I think it's
something like 60 or 70 Meg's at this
point but if you're only rendering
females it's only about 20-30 Meg's
could we go out a couple less of those
but combining them together you'd always
have the same amount block of memory
which would be easier to manage but it's
gonna be more then you necessarily need
to use you have to make that choice
between you kitty now we're gonna add 20
30 40 more female has this or are we
gonna use that space to put male head
put the male heads that are exist in
that scene that's correct yeah exactly
and that's why I say it's a data
management problem because it's you know
for example I'd really like to get a
squadron proto rig so that the only ones
that are squadron related are loading in
that in that proto rig so it's a way of
us managing that data in a kind of an
interesting way but it does take some
work that's all so yeah far further out
but again if there becomes a lot of
gameplay relevance to doing it like we
do do the sense of a father thing or if
we do you want to you guys to picture
parents or something like that like the
GTA kind of approach then then yeah
that'll become more important but at
this point it's not really
massive requirement and I think you guys
will get super far just with the hybrids
already and I think that's gonna make a
big big big difference to the way that
you guys interface with it and I don't
think you'll find necessarily that you
need to blend them yeah I think it's a
matter of priority it's more important
to get more female heads and yes double
up on the male and we're I always get to
is just a I want a reason to do it I
don't like doing things for the sake of
doing things I'd rather have a goal or
an end goal or a reason to actually do
that tech rather than just doing tech
for the sake of tech questions about
eyebrows it probably just goes along to
the same thing with the makeup yeah
the eyebrows are baked in yeah that's
like the texture and and and same
problem around your eyebrows you do get
a difference back to the reaction and we
actually have to paint out the cloth
around the eyebrows because what ends up
looking it ends up looking really fake
when when light rolls oh man do your
faces have so much subtle stuff in it
that if it's not there completely breaks
it down and and it's just it's constant
but within the eyebrows the we paint out
the gloss in that area so basically make
it less glossy around the eyebrows the
reason we do that is it looks a lot less
fake is the idea they're part of the
texture right now what I've talked to
Corey about it's the same problem with
scalps we have to make sure we've remove
all the basic hair out of some of our
texture scans so when the guys were
scanned with textures they had little
beanie caps on with their hair sticking
honest up we got to remove all of that
because now we have a generic scalp that
we can apply and we need a scout because
it has directionality on it so when
inspected the rolls around and then when
you put the hair on top of that but you
can't have other hair underneath because
your hairline then doesn't line up to
what the scalp is and it can look really
weird so basically what I'm saying is
we've got to treat eyebrows the same as
hair we actually kind of talked about
this already but I I was so impressed by
the question I want to make sure it gets
in there and see if there's anything
more we can add to it the question I
murdered this verbatim here says a child
can always be slightly outside the
limitations of their parents idea a
child can grow taller or shorter than
both parents DNA phases are always in
between the two pair
faces so if player face will always be
more average than the parents faces
how will we prevent all phases from
ending up as the same average face after
a number of generations and then
introduces heirs every time you do that
there's no no clear solution on that
right now
but I quite honestly haven't had it be a
massive problem yet and at the point
that it does become one then sure we'll
do something about it but right now I
just don't see it as a is a huge issue
especially because again we're gonna
randomize the weights and everything
within their mom you could eventually
get to that state but i just-i can't--
haven't seen it happen with regard to
character customization it's a matter of
introducing more extreme options yeah
and waffle more meaningful choices to
make I mean with regards to the legacy
system it would be about managing it so
that it does introduce elements of error
does within that blend you wouldn't ever
end up beyond that blend but you because
we blend between four different heads
you don't necessarily have just the
weights between these two people that's
right eventually you know this just that
this does come into the depth of a
spaceman and yeah and legacy and stuff
eventually you know the mom's gonna have
the data among cue us to just really
shake things up yeah I like the word
just take it's my gift to you a minor
detail but can you let us choose skin
color and texture before we model our
faces yes so we are that's one of the
things that we're trying to do for the
the v-2 is to make those decisions less
segregated we want to make it so that
you're able to jump back and forth
between all the elements that really
impact your choices much much easier so
we want to bring in the the skin
selection into the same screen as where
you're doing a lot of the head selection
and stuff that's some of the stuff that
we're exploring right now and and yeah
that'll definitely help that that
process because right now if you want to
see what what this feature would look
like and you start going towards
something oh the skin tone doesn't
really feel right anymore I want to go
towards something lighter or darker or
different and then you need to navigate
away from the thing you were just doing
it's it's a it's definitely a UX problem
it's like context switching you totally
lost the perfect frame child yeah I
thought that person would look like with
a different tone I mean I mean vv1 of
this character customizer with blending
is all about how do we communicate how
this novel system works to two new
players one of the things that was
really important is it is not a
sculpting system so we don't want to use
any any tools that operate similar to
what you might use in ZBrush or Macs or
anything look I'm gonna take this thing
and move it over here that's not how the
data works it's not something we're
gonna be able to actually get you
towards the result that you're expecting
from China at the moment you try to do
something and it it and it reacts
incorrectly you immediately have a break
of that mental model and you immediately
have a bad experience so step one not
sculpting we need to communicate that
and then we want it step two was trying
to get it so that we can try to
communicate but when you're blending
these things you have the full breadth
of choices at every step so one of the
initial things is like we we keep
showing you the heads that come in and
out and they do all that stuff because
we felt that it was important to try to
get across that when you go to edit the
nose you don't need to be using the same
pool of four foreheads to manipulate
that nose that you used for the brows or
you can have you can have a unique head
selection on every single of these
features and blend them independently
that is a level of control and minutia
that we're feeling is proven to be a
little bit beyond what has helped us
more what do with yeah so we're I we've
sort of keyed in on the thing that
worked the thing that was was nice about
the way that we set it up is trying to
make the coarsest broadest choices early
and refine from there so each choice is
how do
get closer to what I'm looking for
instead of how do I identify which thing
I need to change so it's you know
focusing in more on then the next step
is I want to look more like this guy and
I want to look more like this I want
this skin instead so bringing that into
the same panel making it so that you
don't have to go to a different stuff is
absolutely part of that process of how
do I give you the clearest broadest
choice such that you can refine from
there yeah so for the for the v2 for the
v2 stuff what we do and what we've
talked about a lot is is currently the
UX and the way that people end up making
their characters I don't know we're not
feeling like they're actually getting
the result that they necessarily want or
expect necessarily and a lot of this is
a experimentation but rather than being
be held to what your result is because I
think you know a lot of people play with
it and and they'll get to a result that
they're kind of happy with but it kind
of takes you there rather than you
taking it there if that makes any sense
in the v2 version of it that the whole
that whole mentality is kind of
switching where we'd rather you have a
very precise cut you know as Catholics
talked about like it ever increasing
sort of complexity controls within it
but get the result that you want out of
it actually a little more directly yeah
if you go into the system with an idea
of what you want you will get it we want
you to be able to get it currently
that's a bit more difficult because you
have to sort of comb through the system
for the tools that you need and that was
you know in service of trying to explain
this this novel system but it it might
eat up those choices and so we're trying
to clarify those choices so that they
can be a little bit more useful and
available when players want to use them
yep we're just about I want to get a
couple more questions in here for the
chat
somebody had a suggestion would be
really cool if we could trigger certain
emos during the character creation just
to see how the thing else
and put that one spent yeah one more
task on me is the x2 something we talked
about yeah and I was like alright that's
great for me to task and it's on the
bottom of like 20 cuz it later and then
Spence goes Sean do you want eeeem own
animations or do you want the heads
blend you know and when you press X it
actually goes away
and it's like we got to make a call and
I'm like yeah I want to emotes but and
actually we were meant and we tried to
get it in time I don't I don't think we
made it the different animation at the
end for the review oh that got it got it
is in it kind of cuts to the new
animation student like oh really it just
kind of blends we gotta go baby we got a
fixed date yeah blend time yeah school I
didn't know it got in because we did get
some animation at the end uh nobody
liked the the pose that we had at the
end because it was super slouchy it was
like yeah well no the girl I guess
you're the female looks very slow she
and what it and the angle of it it was
coming back yeah so what it does it with
the at that fov and with that
perspective it makes her head look tiny
on the body like it does to the male -
to be fair it's just it's seemingly more
obvious on the female so so short answer
is yeah we want we want to get that but
it'll become a priority call once we get
closer to the end of the quarter I'm
sure yeah we wanted to expand the review
step with a lot of those sorts of things
of not checking out your inner emotes
checking out different loadouts checking
out different lighting situations that's
right and I don't know if we've talked
about it much but like that the whole
example I keep using and and hopefully
people recognize it is the is the XCOM
photo mode like - and when you were
making your soldiers basically you had
this great little photo mode that you
could go into which was like you could
see different attachments on them and
put different backgrounds you know
things like that that was kind of the
mentality around review we'd also like
for v2 and I'm not sure if we put this
in the estimate actually yet but we'd
like to have the different loadouts so
we'd like to be able to show you guys at
the end of that similar to how other
character
graders in mmo's work generally they
like to show you like the really really
awesome armor like endgame perfect you
know you've got everything like the shop
there I said basically right so so I can
imagine just having the three loadouts
within it would be nice so basically the
the you know no clothes civilian clothes
an awesome armor so you could just see
how your characters gonna look with each
one of them I think would be a nice next
thing okay last question and recognizing
that Josh is in here when I so would not
be able to talk about this a whole lot
sure let's promise stuff on his back oh
yeah I can speak for Josh yeah me too
the this is a lot about we've been
talking about the facial customization
because a lot of a lot of this first V
one is specific to the fit to the face
to the base into the head what about
south of the neck it's the character
creator going to expand to think it's a
phrase I'm looking at you because you're
talking uh yeah we'll do that in the how
to do the whole Jared that yeah yeah all
right is this going to are we thinking
this is going to expand to be games the
views and opinions of all the people on
there but I'm so sorry I know we talked
a lot about the platelet the player
metrics how they have to be exercised
but but is that but is that gonna stop
us from being able to do like muscle
tone changes you know so I can be a soft
body person at the same okay so Ripton
yeah and perceptually replace and
address is very keen to do this and he's
he's pretty confident that he could get
there longhand cough a keen and
confident it's white so that's why I
told him I adore him for that
because because I have my own
reservations about it I'm not I'm not
sure technically it's a it's a technical
and and a bit of a visual thing to we
have you know 1502 I think about 1500
character items right now when we did
the facial attachments there was like 50
not a big deal to go over the facial
attachments put the mark-up in the DA
that the facial customization and
runtime deformers needed a little
different story on 1500
mm assets and that's what's getting
harder and harder by the way about about
doing systems within star citizen and
for the game is that the sheer breadth
of content that you have sometimes have
to update makes a it makes a very real
impact on the feature like are we gonna
do it this way because holy holy that's
a lot of updates that we gotta make it
routes also it's easy to balloon from
there like you're just you're just
talking about character assets for what
they're wearing yeah you're not even
talking about what's what has to change
about their animations whatever change
about anything short harding yeah the
seats and the ladders like that's true
so so i'd i cool i don't expect he'll do
anything with the heights but absolutely
the body shapes we do want this right we
do want this it's just there is a
technical challenge within it and
there's different ones than the face
brought but i have lots of confidence
and address and evo and those guys over
in frankfurt and they're absolutely
looking at it but i mean we can't
promise it at all because we don't have
it work in yet but we'd like to and if
we get there it'll use very similar
system with the runtime deformers and
it'll be quite interesting i think once
we get there all right well that wraps
this up thank you so much calyx spencer

day i know everybody's a got a lot of
3-5 tasks on them to try to get that

push of 3.5 when that goes live i don't
