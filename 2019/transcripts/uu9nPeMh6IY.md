hey everybody welcome to star citizen
live affecting the visuals this week our
show is all about the creation of visual
effects and joining us on the show this
week is director of visual effects or a
visual defect effects director you know
he'll tell me which one that is
Mike Snowden Mike how you doing man I'm
well thanks how are you
I'm doing alright which one is it is it
director visual effects is the visual
effects director is a really matter it
doesn't really matter does it
I direct the effects directly the
effects so we've had you on the show
before I think it was last year
sometimes we had you having on a panel
with a couple other folks we had we we
had some generic questions about the
effects what we're going to do today
you know once we're done talking for a
little bit is we're gonna go into we're
gonna go into the engine and we're going
to actually demonstrate a bit about a
bit of your team's work some of the
things your teams are working on how we
create them how that process is done
because visual visual effects at least
to me are I don't I don't know if many
people have ever seen a game without
visual effects I see it here all the
time in early builds and whatever and I
see a designer flying around a ship with
absolutely no effects whatnot it's well
it's pretty funny looking just it just
looks they just look like a rock through
space visual effects do so much to bring
life to to any scene they're in and so I
was really excited to get the
opportunity to get you here and to show
this for us before we get started why
don't you tell us a little bit about
what your team does specific the visual
effects seems like it could cover a lot
so so it was a run down what are the
types of what are the types of things
that we see in star citizen everyday
that your team is responsible for Wow
okay well as you say I mean the effects
kind of everywhere in the game you know
and it's sometimes you're doing a good
job making the effects when people don't
necessarily notice as you say if there's
no effects in the scene you know because
everything it just looks lifeless and
still so one of the things for
the effects is is exactly that to kind
of create motion and life and movement
whereas where otherwise there wouldn't
be any we kind of so we serve this
design team as much as we do serve the
art seems as well you know so even if
you think about the most I guess the the
the effects I'm most familiar with the
thirst is on a ship without them you're
not necessary going to see that your
ships moving you know if you're looking
third person mode so yeah we're kind of
what kind of servants to the art and
design teams really yeah and how did we
affect play in the environment placement
of dust dust motes flames you know
anything again all that kind of motion
and movement they expect to see in in a
real world environment surface
interactions as well so that in bed in
the vehicles and a place into the
environment footsteps London dust
effects all that kind of stuff yeah and
in a general sense why why are things
like like dust and in fog and stuff
necessary it's it's we see this we see
this question a lot and I'm just gonna
hit you with this one right off the bat
you know quite we put fog everywhere why
is their desk everywhere I was watching
I watched the new Godzilla movie last
last week and every scene is coated in
fog and rain in other stuff which I'm
sure absolutely we're not there when
they were filming why do we do that well
I'm looking outside and every every
scene is covered in [ __ ] rain outside
so oh no I mean it's an art direction
thing you know a lot of you know out
there are directors enjoy being able to
create atmospheric environments so and I
don't mean literally atmosphere because
obviously were making the space game but
adding things like fog and dust allows
scenes to be lit more volumetrically as
well so it's really just creating yeah
just serving the needs of the art
direction I guess now before we get
started I have to I need to ask you
about your what's what's that on the
left and I was seeing I'm seeing an 64
I'm seeing what looks like the EU
version of the Super Nintendo Wii
had their mom I guess in your left my
right that's not the Super Nintendo that
we had we over here we had this purple
monster the purple brick purple brick
yeah this is my this is my it's my
collection I have surround myself with
all my old consoles to kind of remind me
of why I got into this industry as
cheesy as that sounds but yeah yeah I
don't play them as oh yeah I've got it
I've got my Dreamcast up and running
it's not at the moment obviously it's
just there but yeah yeah so yeah I just
I just love all the all the old games
I got consoles I got a I got one of
those all-in-one consoles they sell it
like the fair that does like five rows
actually it's 7 consoles in one I think
yeah it's on a premium for space but I
just like of it I that's not what this
shows about we're gonna get off consoles
I just somebody would somebody would
kill me if we talked about consoles the
entire era would you I would like to do
it so let's go ahead and jump anything
so I understand you've got a you've got
a scene set up for us yeah sure ok so
I'll switch to that okay can you see
that Dagon's there so this is just a
super simple scene this is the kind of a
variant of my my good old faithful test
particle scene I just filled this with
you know just all kinds of park was
really but I thought that for the
purpose of this of this I would start
with a simple an effect as possible
really it's just this tiny little dot
this whole thing I was like a modern art
installation yeah well there's actually
a reason for this so this was when I was
originally setting up different scale
explosion effects and damage effects so
these were I think this is 2 meters for
me is and it was all kind of incremental
scales to make sure that the right the
right scale was in adhere to but yeah so
so I would say 80% a large chunk of the
VFX artists job EIG in particular is
working with particles mm-hmm
and so yeah we have we have well it's
actually called the VFX editor now
because there's more to it now than just
just particles it used to be the
particle editor
but now it compasses a few more things
which are all kind of probably elaborate
on lights around but yeah so in its end
its kind of most simple form we can just
place my basic effect and you can see
that I'm going to come around I can draw
draw with it do my signature and then
from there you know depending on what
the requirements are whatever the
whatever the art the art team have
requested all the designers have
requested this thing will eventually
become something completely different it
could become dust rain fog like we'll
just be talking about it could be become
a thruster anything that you can think
of this in the game this V effects it
can be coming up all through this both
of this editor become one of those
things I think I can kind of jump to
something to another example of
something quite different that's just a
sign this so here you go we just got
some fairly simple sparks really using
GP particle so I have that looks ribbon
L to increase the count significantly
its collide in you can see it's kind of
colliding with the environment it's been
affected by the gravity that I've got
set up on the scene as well if I switch
the gravity off it will change what the
effect looks like first ones one thing
about working with particles really is
there's lots of we kind of very much try
to adhere to the real-world settings I
guess to kind of make them as believable
believable as possible can we kill bear
gravity and see what happens sure yeah
you like to bear with me I'll be usually
I've got all these windows across three
different monitors so I'm just going to
be dragging things into the to the main
screen for the purpose of this demo so
yeah if I switch the gravity off they go
off it goes I do the same thing in no
gravity okay
I noticed the color changes you're
moving it what is that yes so this is
this is kind of particle color over life
the reason here is the the hotter it is
the Col is going to change based on the
heat of the thing so I've got I guess
I've got to take a look
Oh lots of hierarchies as well the
particles we're not just limited to one
one emitter but yeah we've got a color
right in here so this is the particle
age curve so the life of this particle
is specified here so this the each of
these individual particles are gonna
last for the three three seconds I've
actually got a random value on it as
well
without the randomization everything
starts to look a lot more uniform so
suppose I just stripped that backing see
it's all looking very uniform now and
yeah changing the color over the edge
you'll see that the value kind of
increase it so it's it's blue for
basically half of its life and then it
starts to go orange but also what go on
sorry beer oh yeah I'm just gonna say
we've also got an alpha curve on as well
so actually while it's changing color
it's also becoming less and less opaque
so they gradually dissipates into the
air how many particles are we looking at
here well it's a count of 20,000
so that's 20,000 particles in this one
single of that yep yep that's right yeah
yeah that's fine though that's fine
let's just let's go
200,000 why don't you can see what's
happening as well because there's such a
high count now I don't if you can see it
but the screen is absolutely like around
it it's kind of it's the exposure
exposure it's darkening anything around
it as well and that's kind of again kind
of simulating and that's the dynamic
exposure on the lumberyard camera that's
right yeah yeah so yeah the exposure
settings a camera based yeah so brought
that back down to 20,000 because 200,000
was a bit intense even for me and when
you were dragging it around it was
changing color and I know the color is
supposed to change based on the heat but
why was it changing when you were
dragging it around it's actually not
changing because I'm talking right and
you just see in the color change a bit
more because as I'm moving it those
particles are spawning continuously
graduate okay I can hear you I guess oh
yeah at the start of each Parker's life
it's it's this blue so this just makes
it more clear I wanna do that I want to
do the disneyland phantasm music when
you
I'm slightly disappointed I don't
actually have a lot of fiber particles
for this demo but I can you put the
gravity back on and move it so I can see
how it differs so actually got a gravity
box so it's actually the box itself
probably doesn't cover the whole area oh
yeah yeah so yeah you just get this
lovely cascade in and then from doing
that there's a whole range of settings
though that I can edit and I need to
edit so make it look convincing
so as soon as you're thinking about
effects behaving you know based on on on
gravity settings you want to be thinking
about the the track and the mass of the
thing and you've he go we've got gravity
scale so I can actually if I just reduce
that gravity scale they're still being
affected by the gravity boat just like a
10 a 10 percent of what they were before
I can do the opposite as well I can make
it really heavy so they're just flying
down up yeah
conversely I can I can leave it next to
gravity so if you want so Monday and
then Friday something else has just
kicked in I think I've just done abled
something else I think I've got wind or
something that is now yeah so that sort
of thing so gravity is one thing then
we've got wind as well so it's just yeah
so yeah I mean I've got I've put
together a few examples here to be
honest I didn't put as many together as
I would have would have liked to the day
kind of run away with me but yeah um all
sorts in here but before we got a
question from the chat here it says how
do you account for the various graphic
quality settings on a user's end do you
have to make separate effects well we
could actually really nice we haven't
necessarily got all of our like system
spec settings locked down because this
was still in development you know
technology's still graphics cards are
still being released and things like
that but we got a really nice setting
here actually like and it's not trying
to demonstrate this we've got this max
distance log which itself has its own
curves so if I give this max distance
Lord must use the sparks one of them
okay so it's optimal I'm just going to
talk about bit about optimization not
not specifically system specs but this
this kind of ties into it to make this
more optimal there's a few things I'm
going to be doing I'm going to give it a
max distance lot so let's just set that
to something quite quite sure so this is
a distance of 10 meters what I'm going
to do is I'm going to control the count
based on that distance so with this
curve here I'm saying that by the time
it goes to 10 meters the count has gone
from 20,000 to 0 just change that curve
so just like our ships and anything else
have logs in widget level of details the
effects have an actual like a dynamic
log system based on how far away from it
you are exactly yeah exactly that yeah I
noticed I've got some funky buttons on
my shelf as well so this used to be
effect self so one of the things that
I've got here the distance think so I
can see that it's actually 30 meters
away from the camera fact let's just
make that a little bit bigger so this
100 meters is it's much distance a lot
that's a zero check how far away I am
from it
a bit further kind of fading away hmm
so this is one of the ways that we were
able to have really high GPU particle
count it's not like this thing is
constantly a drain on the on the players
GPU where we're very sensible with the
way that we optimize the effects so what
else you got for us that's just not a
look that surely so this isn't a
continuous abilities like a burst effect
I've actually put this on any speed over
life so I've got it's something that we
probably haven't really used a huge
amount actually in our in our effects in
the game so far but we've got a speed
over life curve here this allows me to
change the speed of that particle over
its life this is technically this is in
and we call the mode artistic as opposed
to physical so one on the 100 was
talking about being kind of physically
based and adhering to the rules of
gravity and wind and things like that on
the flip side of that we can also become
a bit more creative as well so we can we
can make this these effects the
basically each particle now is going to
be slowing down again over the lifetime
which is five seconds this thing is
going to be if I take off the random 40
actually don't know what the what is the
40 I don't know if it's miles per hour
kilometers per hour it's just the speed
let's just say it's it's a speed of 40
and yeah what's going to do is halfway
through its life it's going to slow down
completely to zero speed it's going to
ramp up again and that's how you ended
up with some quiet like an interest in
movement and I think that some of the
effects and I gave some of the more
alien effects I guess you're going to be
able to benefit from that sort of more
creative approach it's it's what what
happens commonly and start as it is is
we you know you take anything not just a
VFX any answer to the game to the point
to through all the points of realism you
know affected by gravity affected by
wind
and then you once you've got all the
realistic aspects there now you have to
tweak for creativity for artistic
license for completely we want the thing
to look how we want the thing to look so
yeah it's good to see something like
this the artistic thing it's like
realistically there might be no reason
for the particle to start off at this
speed and then slow down and then speed
up again you know unless we're talking
about you know weird sentient tachyons
or something but well why not I like
that we're able to so we try and we're
kind of striving for realism in terms of
realistic looking graphics but we kind
of we're very much in influenced by
Hollywood as well aren't we so we all
got a lot of sci-fi movies and I think
they have the same thing that I want to
try and make it look convincing but
sometimes what sometimes your perception
of what is realistic isn't actually the
same as what is realistic so we just
find our balance of stuff looking
realistic also looking cool if it
doesn't look cool then you know we are a
question the chat asking how you test
for various lighting conditions like
obviously we're in it we're in a very
dark scene here how do you how do you
know your particle is going to work in a
variety different conditions good
question we've actually got a time of
day slider so what I would say is that I
would be if I was working on an effect I
would be back and working this testing
sure that's fine but I would always be
making sure this look we're looking at
it in Scituate making sure we're looking
today in if it was on the PE we'd be
looking at it in in the pu level we've
been making sure we look at it on Planet
and if we're looking at our planet we've
got to make sure we we've kind of moved
the Sun around or move the particle
around the planet so that it's
essentially we can't really sign off an
effect that's all it's been it's been
tested thoroughly under all under all
the lighting conditions that also
applies to gravity as well because we
need to make sure you know if I go back
to that spark effect I need to make sure
I might have it looking really cool when
gravity is on I need to make sure it
also kind of works in space as well you
know I couldn't I can't really cheat as
much as maybe we can in other in other
games we have to be very very thorough
with our testing for
yeah and to answer a Killa marks
question you can see it bouncing off the
off the boxes now okay yes yeah so this
is this is actually screen space
collision which is one of my favorite
settings that we've got we've got plans
doing it to kind of flush out the
feature so it's it's got the first kind
of pass at the screen space collision it
it's a much much it's a GPU
it's a said before collision it's much
much cheaper than the CPU collision that
we have on the old CPU particles it does
have its limitations because it's
because it's purely based on because
it's a visual thing if you if I go
behind this wall you'll see that it's
all of a sudden it's gone it's because
you've taken it's taking it from the
point of the mission so it thinks that
there's nothing there now so what we
would typically do for an effect like
this I'd probably create another version
of that effect
I'm even gonna name it as I would the
thoroughness ice then so I've done
they're basically just copy and paste it
then one of the nice things about this
the effects editor is that these what
we're seeing here this this library call
it particle library this is basically an
XML file so the copying and pasting
process is just very straightforward we
can even copy and paste directly in the
XML like you know plus plus or something
but yeah what I would typically do is
sorry I was rumbling them I do ramble a
lot sometimes
okay so I've duplicated it I've created
I won't take the screen space collision
what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna have
that count so I'm kind of splitting it
out now half of them are gonna have
screen space collision the other half
ants and what that should mean is that
you can still see these particles here
they're not being cold anymore
so that's just one of the ways that we
would potentially work on that the
problem that I have there is that
because these aren't colliding they're
gonna just go through the floor so I'd
like to say there's a this these
elements that we really we need to flush
out the feature set it's all it's all in
the schedule it's all there somewhere
yeah so you've got to you got two
particles run in simultaneous right now
one is colliding with the floor or the
other one it's not going into the poor
exactly yeah
and it's technically it's one effect
still is this is like in the hierarchy
this is just a child you can change the
color on though the second one so we can
see their difference course we can what
color would you like red I was gonna say
hot pink but that's fine I'm not happy
that's better I think uh yeah I can hear
cheering cheering of approval okay
I think in reality because it's an
attitude it's additive and it's very
very emissive it's all kind of just blew
me now but yeah I prove that it's pink
though I just tell mr. or paint they go
yeah this again like there's all kind
I've not really talked about any of
these things but we've got emissive
lighting so I'm really demonstrating
kind of hot
hi emissive FX it and if you drop below
we
should see that only the pink ones are
going through the floor or is it only
the other ones that we went through
before it will only be the pink ones
yeah although I need to change the well
you know there will be they go purple
rain right see what else we got here
there was a question I saw in the chat
and went by so fast that I didn't catch
it
looking for it right now okay it's gone
I imagined it
so what else we got to looking at what
else do we have to look at here okay
well um we've also got so one of the
things that I wanted to talk about a
little bit is some of the ways that we
can manipulate the motion of the of our
effects as well so we have as well as
relying on gravity wind eccentric cetera
as I've mentioned we've also got various
ways in which we can introduce noise
into the effect so we have we have in
listen here that the movement category
we've got vortex turbulence we've got
curl noise we have SDF which is signed
distance fields which essentially I'm
going to get and they'll get flamed if I
go this wrong the question was I was
let's ask him to explain it and then I
realized this is a minefield because
everybody gets really close to it and
then messes em so go ahead and try and
then I'll have Sean Tracy evaluate you
afterwards okay okay well my
interpretation of it is that it's
basically text year the can tell us that
the closest distance from a surface so
we would be able to use it for example
if I I'm not going to kind of make one
live because I'd have to I know it just
wouldn't be fun to do but this this kind
of area here this is scheduled one for
an hour
I've nominate someone else on the team
if we really need to yeah basically I
could create a sound distance field but
from the geometry this kind of
surrounding plinth I think what it would
be cook but yeah
if I create the scientists feel that
this I would be able to make sure that
the particles so as well as having
screen space collision that the
particles are going to know the the
distance from that surface so they're
going to know when they're actually
going to hit that thing what that's
going to to give you some some examples
of where that's going to be really
really useful in the game for gas cars
for example we're going to be able to
have what we already do have to be fair
we've got signed distance fields for the
gas clouds and we can we can make
particles actually slow down or rather
than passing through the gas cars we can
make them conform to the to the shape of
the gas cloud and it gives us a really
nice way of layering extra texture onto
the gas clouds to to kind of increase
that resolution and make them look
prettier but yes so that's that's one
thing we've got what else have we got we
got vector field so a vector field is
another kind of 3d texture format that
is kind of I guess that vector fields
just gives us another way to manipulate
and push particles around we can we
create a vector field in like offline
rendered so in it in something like
Houdini for example 3d studio max and
that gives us the ability to to generate
yeah much more I guess more kind of
detailed when so in in the engine at the
moment we've got yeah we've got the wind
where the wind is basically directional
so we can control the direct and the
strength but we can't can't bring in
that kind of finesse to make much
smaller dust motes you know kind of
turbulence swirling around and things
like that so that's where vector fields
have been really useful I think actually
me how one of my senior VFX artists he
did a demonstration at citizencon last
year where he had a vector field set up
and I think it was the hammerhead engine
room and he basically made this lovely
vector field it was from all the
geometry inside that room and the
particles were pushing around so if you
have like a post in the middle of the
room you could make the particles push
around rather than just going straight
through it that was in the second stage
as there's no last year and that's
that's right you know it should be
available on youtube right now if
anybody wants to chase that up
afterwards I strongly recommend looking
at it so very very cool that was yeah so
what is this effect that we've been
looking at what
is called the texta too small for me to
read this is vortex and curls when I
started as I was talking I wasn't even
really sure that was what I was doing so
yeah this is I'm giving a demonstration
of vortex students as well as curl
knives okay so let's take a look at this
then I remember now
so well I've got here I've got I've got
a particle that's got a finite lifetime
of ten so it's gonna it's gonna the the
emitter it's gonna last for ten seconds
what I'm doing this I'm pulsing it so
even though it's even though it's got a
finite lifetime it's gonna resume so
once it reaches its it's ten second
well basically over ten seconds it's
going to start again so every ten
seconds this thing is reborn without any
turbulence on it just looks like this
it's just a big X fear of ten thousand
particles since I had vortex turbulence
you see what it's doing hmm
and what what is I know turbulence in
the sense of air travel what is
turbulence here mean it's the same kind
of thing really it's just it's it's a
it's a type of noise so it's it's yeah
it's providing turbulence for the
direction of the particles it's just a
randomly generated shaking anything here
yeah yeah well it's twisting it is
because that's why it's a vortex
turbulence is it's essentially creating
that kind of vortex shape if I put the
h2 yeah that's so you can kind of see
there if I let me just kill all this
I'll just just a really kind of minor
note as well and it won't be very
glamorous but one of the one of the cool
things about this editor's again me.how
actually he he has he's not just a VFX
artist he's also got a little bit of
coding ability so he's actually
improving this editor for as we're going
along so it sounds like a really basic
thing but we have just really nice
things like reverts at default and lupin
announced our points loopy mode all this
kind of functionality that just speeds
up the workflow that might get
overlooked sometimes it's super cool
we got a question in the chat I think
century have you ever had it just yeah
it turn my auto scroll off and it's
still going which is hard gold-bug
I lost the question it was basically
have you ever created a in effect there
have you ever had to make a particle
effect for something that you Jin that
genuinely surprised you that they needed
something I hadn't thought about before
mmm well not at this company am I
allowed to talk about all the places
where I have strange effects requests
yes so I had the request from a for a
cinematix for a like a cartoony classic
cartoony game and they needed a cheese
smell particle effect cheese smell yeah
it's like hey I need a I need a cheese
smell like when a cartoon brings that up
a piece of stinky cheese yeah yeah but
it's the way that people say it
sometimes it's just like yeah yeah she
smell it's the most normal thing in the
world but yeah I mean to be a bit more
serious the the thing about start is and
there's there's there's all kinds of
requests again going back to the
original question like where are the
effects in the game yeah I mean there's
all kinds of stuff we're looking at well
it's not just particles either that's so
one thing I wanted to talk about is we
don't just exclusive the work of
particles even though we're very heavily
geared towards it but you know we've got
fog we got screen effects we you you
will have seen no doubt loads of
information on the gas clouds again we
did a we showed a nice demo at
citizencon last year and we've been like
incrementally improving that that's
settled throughout there so far
yeah I mean it's some of the some of the
requests that we get pretty out there
you know we've got we've got art
directors with very very creative art
directors as you'd expect so yeah lots
lots of awesome requests really it's
never it's never a dull moment you think
we can look at some of that gas clouds
that no well why not let's do that
I mean since you brought it up oh look
at you you've got it all in there yeah
yeah yeah I got a I got Jake to to set
this up for me even let's it for me but
yes so this isn't anything to do with
particles this isn't a particle but this
is this is something that we've
collaborated very heavily with the
graphics team obviously the graphics
team take you know more credit for
allowing us to actually place these kind
of things into our environments this is
this is this is one of the kind of more
sexy things I guess one of them or less
less proven types of tech in in real
time game development so being able to
work with this kind of this kind of tool
says is very inspiring as an artist I
would say yeah and very challenging as
well so I you know I jump into game I'm
gonna run the corn I'm gonna try jumping
into game no way I'm flowing so one of
the things that we produced that one of
the things that we we're working as a
VFX team we're working really closely
with the graphics team and art and
design as well will you want to actually
bring in and again this is this is
something that we've we've demoed in in
citizencon last year and and all the
times we want to be able to bring in
particles we want it to be a systemic so
what we're doing with bb's if I can just
jump back out of game again I'm gonna
read it some scenes on the VDB ants to
yourself I know we have this whole thing
right before citizencon where we had to
look it up and we were finding different
definitions online and I was the second
you said I was remembering this terrible
search we were we were going through
before citizencon where we actually had
like conflicting definitions of what VDB
meant I don't know anyone can I asked my
team sure they'll be someone it knows
this is the point on star citizen live
where we go and we have we asked our
team members who might know things that
we don't this is a very common part of
video game development because no one
team member can be expected to know
absolutely everything about the work
that they do and one of the benefits of
working on a team so the funny thing is
no one seems to know they're all they're
all just Google and I mean I could do
that you know but definitely volumetric
something yeah it's volumetric I mean
that one's kind of obvious I mean having
figured out the V is kind of it doesn't
really show anything but I built this
whole thing up about how you were gonna
go ask a partner and how the strengths
of working in teams gets us things and
so glad you came back like you know no
well I mean ally and vampire just just
over there they'd know the answer for
their there in a there any discussion
about something I don't want to sleep ok
good good go ahead yeah I was just gonna
show so we've actually got a whole we
got a room system the room system again
people be familiar with from from
hearing here another like designers in
particular talking in other shows but we
would have these video be hooked up to
the room system so the VDP itself is
going to be dynamically spawning effects
and that's all driven through the room
system and the rooms the work that's
been done on that the entity effects
system that's that's leo is one of our
VFX programmers and what that allows us
to do we can basically I'm not going to
play around with these scents too much
because I'm just going to break
something there's a lot of sense here
but we have a gameplay gameplay settings
section here and there's a density x
hopefully this is going to work if i
ramp that up need to be in-game oh no I
see it working
so what are we doing I'm changing the
the density multiplied over artistry
laughs it says you know is it going to
limit my screen is too far away to read
the words yeah I've got it I've got a
feeling it's too subtle as well for the
I don't think it's going to translate
very well but basically if I can get to
a point where I can see the light can
you see the kind of lab it's sort of
this I was hoping it'd be much much more
more strong but yeah what I was gonna
say was we've also got particles that
are being being dynamics bonding based
on the voxel density of the VDB um just
quickly trying in July
again reason reason for that so that
that's where as I was saying before we
we kind of serve gameplay as well as
design as well as as much as we do are
as well and this is another thing we're
collaborating closely with the designers
it's not just about how the thing looks
but it all sorts of how it feels and one
of the common problems with with gas
clouds with them being such a so large
and so kind of nebulous it was quite
easy to lose track of where you are and
stuff and that ring that's why we
brought in we bring in particles to give
you that sense of space and that feeling
of speed as well I'm just gonna try and
find a light it's a good look these
right light guess I'm just gonna so this
isn't necessary gonna look as pretty as
it does but I'm just gonna do for
visibility okay okay ooh I'm man it's
more subtle than I wanted it to be
you kind of see only the one that would
when I move the camera but I'm just yeah
I'll try and find a video like it maybe
that kind of demonstrates a bit better I
mean really bees are the the VFX team as
if there's a there's people at oh can
you see them now yeah see yeah so that's
all I was trying to find you then it
probably isn't that exciting really but
yeah the point is that these effects
I've not placed these manually at all
because that's a really
an aspect of making a game so as big as
ours we need to need to be smart with
the tools as well we need to come up
with methods to allow these things to
systemically appear and to come in based
on rule sets rather than just having to
manually place because it wouldn't ever
be sustainable for the VFX eyes to just
you know base all these emitters
everywhere we find that with just about
every department it's we have to build
sustainable procedural systems because
when you're working at something the
scale of star citizen even with you know
even with five studios across the world
view you you have to there has to be
some procedural element to almost
everything I mean that's something as
well as properties going off on a
tangent now but one thing that we've
been really really focusing on this this
quarter so far is the prop planet it's
perfect improvements as well and that's
a similar thing where there's work being
done to improve the actual planets
themselves I think and I think it's
planets before and we're also we're also
improving our effects based on the work
was getting done on planets before so
again it's rulesets so the so the the
terrain itself is going to be driving
the particles it's going to be deciding
where particles appear based on height
and that sort of thing so that's pretty
pretty cool as well
again very challenging but very cool
kill Merc has a question about whether
clouds like this will affect radar and
scanning well this isn't a question for
Mike kill mark that's actually that's
actually a game design question and I
didn't want to call you out specifically
but it's a good example of the type of
questions that you are for game
designers as opposed to VFX directors
and stuff like that so you see a lot of
those questions come through every
single every single show and I I have
them to qui tacet yeah yeah I think I
think I know the answer though Jared I
think I can answer it I see why go ahead
you thought you made this whole thing
about how you're not the person to ask
but I note I know the answer yeah okay
go ahead try and if you mess it up I'm
gonna tell her Tom a bleeped
so short answer is yeah vdps can can
affect your am reading you're going to
get I know this because we've worked on
the screen interference aspect of it as
well so we used I think initially on the
first pass we had it set up to to voxel
density so the virtual density just a
demo that it could be done voxel density
was creating interference
let's try bringing in a [ __ ] see if it
actually works while I'm talking if it
doesn't then I'm shamed myself yeah way
too fast
yeah basically the distant you know I
was talking like sound distance field
before the the distance from the wall is
what we are going to be using to as one
of the options to have electromagnetic
interference effect the noise look at
that it's not doing anything let's
forget about it I were it's cloud is
problematic well the problem is it's not
problematic wanna can be problematic see
it's too nice it's a nice cloud anyway
alright so we've got about 20 minutes
left what else do we got I feel like I
got a loud [ __ ] I've got some videos as
well is it working just just blasting
through some videos to show Joe some
random still so this loads that I
haven't talked about as well as just
having like the simple particles I've
been showing we've also got a lightning
region we've got have icon example of
that we've got spline guided particles
which which kind of tie in with the
Lightning region let's just do it so I
just try making one sure let's just go
for it I do it live yes as the saying
goes okay so lightning region initially
it's probably gonna look kind of crazy
initially when I bring it in
there you go looks kind of weird this is
let me just make you
so if I bring this my editor cross so
one of the reasons that we renamed this
from particle editor to the effects
editor is very much for the well I'm
gonna show you now so we now have a
light in effect the group like not
lighting yep I'm going to assign this
completely new light in effect to my
default lighting region again sorry I've
got a kind of drug loader loader windows
left and right and again you can see
there's all these kind of settings and
I'm gonna just assign that effect to it
Chris
we're not gonna make a child particle
can't believe I made a decision to do
this live absolute mother yeah we
actually do a pre-show and we do these
things we go over the content million so
there's no surprises and whatnot these
things are all planet even when they
look kind of wonky it's like things are
find out and we were like no we're not
gonna create this life we're gonna show
it though cause it would take too much
time to do it live or whatever and then
windows yeah that's my least kind of
yeah yeah so all I need to do is make
these blind go dude give it some actual
missus what's good i I will fall back to
a video if I can't get this to actually
work by the way I feel like there's a
gremlin in might I seen make it additive
uh just double-check I've got all the
rights weapons in place
[Music]
I feel like I'm gonna fail it found it
screw it
I'm just going to show video something
showing up example ego that's what you
were wrong way something like that so
basically one of the display I wanted to
show this blind guide it affects just
because it gives us again it's like
something that we've not had for that
long I guess with a few months I suppose
with it time flies
we can just get again it goes down that
the kind of creative versus realistic
approach you know but who's to say what
what kind of alien technologies out
there and in our universe in the star
citizen universe this makes me want to
touch the screen see if it travels with
my finger yeah yeah all kinds of stuff
whoa yeah and this is a combination so I
don't know why I've come to this video
but this is a combination of this gives
a good idea that as well as just blame
apart because we're also controlling
camera shake we've got fog in the level
as well and in fact I'm gonna load up a
different scene if that's okay Jared you
you've got 15 minutes you can do
whenever you'd like Mike okay let's do
it so I'm gonna go to an electricity
templates level which is kinda just
another test level I think I did
actually show a version of this in the
gas cloud demo of Boyd's it's a good
example so here we go so we've got some
this reminds me of lesson Yeltsin like
everyone stay calm yeah nothing to see
here
yeah I mean it's to be honest it's like
a good example I would look at when
you're walking around the office you see
people watch some people's screens
usually the VFX this group of people
around where there there there's kind of
crazy shiny stuff on people's screens
and the majority of his wear glasses
no yeah it's no surprise were staring at
this like all day every day but yeah so
if you had to guess how many particles
are we looking at here oh I can I can
look the actual number I don't know it
to be honest it's an interesting
question because the actual number is
less important from work from a
performance and optimization point of
view the number is less relevant it's
more about how much memory the the
allocation is taking up and how many how
many how much memory the the textures
are taking up as well that's what I want
to hear that then not every part of the
was in serial you and I need you know
even adding kill noise I've talked about
if like kill noise quiet but I didn't
kill noise will incur a cost as well so
sometimes you have to see okay well I've
had to kill noise what does it really
add to the effect can I use something
else kind of use the turbulence noise on
its own which is cheaper
it's always about asking yourself
questions about how can I make this as
efficient as possible but it's also
occasionally fun to just go crazy as
well so if I actually played it so I've
got something so I want to track for you
you can see if I show all the helpers
hide it messy kind of surprising how
scary these kind of things kind of look
if you see all these these green lines
that's because I've I've got a particle
with fact that is a rapid way around the
when you find the layer see these ones
here mm-hmm
oh yeah so they're a bit they're a bit
rough looking they're not they're not
kind of I wouldn't put them in the game
like this they neither quite a lot of
work but it's just an example that you
can we can animate these effects as well
and these are just working the way up
and that's what you see all these points
these are all control points that
essentially the spline is rocking its
way up along yeah this fog in here
there's basically particles there's so
many so many terms as so many things I
could talk about space loot particles
are you see how it just feels like this
environment is completely full you know
it's full of fog mm-hmm and it's almost
like infinite I just carry on going
infinitely it's because we're using a
Spacely well some space we perfects and
what they do is they actually title
so they're they're they're kind of we
call them bricks so it's like tiled
bricks and that that gives you that and
they spawn from the camera is so it
makes you feel like you're in this kind
of thick thick environment but really
it's more of a trick we know that
certain effects certain particles have
physical displacement we've seen them
hit walls we know that if a player moves
through them that a bounce off the
player is that something that's possible
with the fog as well
well the fog that I think the large of
the actual individual particle is the
more problematics is going to be we
could make it do it and it's going to
look strange if you if you had like you
know if I had if it right I could just a
single you see me kind of moving a mouse
around in the middle of the screen
you know if the particle was that laid
on the screen and it and it hit though
it hit the boundary it's just gonna look
weird it's just going to give the game
away really it's gonna it's gonna you
know the players going to know that it's
just it's just a smoky texture honor I'm
a big quad so absolutely we can do it
but it's more about you just got to be
sensible with the things that are going
to be using collisions and maybe we just
have dust motes the colliding with the
with the geometry rather than the big
thick fog the thick fog itself would
just begin we'd used the soft particle
settings which makes it fade away as it
gets to the gets to the edge as well
just to show you some really nice
decoupled lighting examples know anyway
so okay I'm gonna load up Delamar okay
so one of the things I just wanted to
know what it felt like to say no to a
developer
did it feel good not really know as good
as I'd hoped I wasn't offended by it you
know you can say no I'll just do it
anyway okay so yeah this quarter one of
the things again we've talked about this
we've talked about this in monthly
reports and in we've shown videos I
think we did a little segment on it
didn't we in fact earlier this season we
did it we did a we refer to every
quarter of the show as the season
internally that's
talking about earliest quarter we get a
bit uh decouple biting yeah cool okay
well I'm gonna load up Delamar which is
obviously one of the one of the more
established environments in our game and
this decoupled lighten rollout that
we're doing it's it's for me postman
forgiving it's like breathing new life
into into the older play all the
locations and I think we're all really
excited to to show the backers when it
goes when it goes into the live live
release get people back in some of these
locations maybe they've not been there
for a while because get excited by all
the new places but yeah it's kind of
probably people get bored of me saying
it but it looks better while costing
less and which is which is you know the
the dream really now for anybody that
didn't see that segment give me the 10
cent version of what the couple lighting
is okay Saudi carpet light is it's
literally the the the lighting of
particles previously was based on the
tessellation of the particle of the the
vertex the vertices of the particles so
to get high-quality shadowing on
particles we had to rely on much greater
amounts of verts and it was
prohibitively expensive we couldn't do
it for such large-scale effects like
this which it just wasn't possible you
we just wouldn't be able to afford it at
all and you just end up with like poor
quali kind of blocky shadows what
decoupled lighting gives us is a much
softer more natural-looking shadowing on
the particles it kind of you kind of see
it's picking up the light really nicely
here this is what this is a good example
of one of the things you talked about
earlier how sometimes the best VFX work
isn't noticed at all like we would
expect to see natural curvy shadows on
stuff like the fog so so when you see
this it's impressive as it is it almost
doesn't look impressive because yeah we
expect this because we've seen it in the
real world so we expect it so it doesn't
stand out as something and it is super
cool
yeah that's what exactly what I was
saying before is like if you do if you
don't you job a lot of the time people
aren't necessarily going to go wow
just got shadows on it you know people
get VFX artists playing games will will
definitely notice I'm sure here's
another one so we're in we're in the
drug lab one of the one of the kind of
OC locations and the PU and this is ooh
this is a great example this is one of
my favorites I love seeing the kind of I
call them cadres I don't know what the
monthly profit so M is for that but
there's a light behind these this kind
of farm and you just get their lines
going through it absolutely love it yeah
gorgeous it's a you know your computer
is in Winslow and we are sending your
image to us here in LA over over a video
conferencing software and then we are
regurgitating that and the second copy
up to folks over teams so this image is
twice processed over what people would
see in on their own client and it still
looks pretty amazing yes I've got a good
point cuz sometimes when we show the
effects in videos compression and
streaming it can kind of take take a hit
but yeah when you see these when you see
in game when the backers get it live I
think they're gonna be super impressed
to show another completely so this I
just got a fold of super random things
that I've made over time for the project
sometimes as well one thing I will say
is a lot of the stuff that I've shown in
these videos it's not so much about this
being actual content in the game it's
more about inspiring inspiring other
developers in the company the VFX
artists but also you know the art and
design teams to know what we can achieve
and what can be made so something like
this is a good example way it's I think
I've called it space anomaly
I mean you wondered this is the nexus
and if you go inside it you'll meet
Captain Kirk exactly there you go we've
we've got a bit of law added to it
already you know
yeah I'm it so okay so I talked about
particles I kind of failed to show
lightning although well kind of yeah
yeah screen effects you will have seen
like camera shaking uh stuff like that
fog we've also got meshes like one thing
that I don't actually have a good
example of it right now but we we've
also just implemented a nice some nice
improvements to the to the wall recall
and the VFX transparency shader so a lot
of the time what you see in that I've
got these particles mm-hmm that's it
kind of have this lovely slow slow soft
environmental dust and so we've also got
a really nice mesh now mesh shader that
we can add and this is super simple
stuff to be fair like it's not that it's
not like wow star citizen scrolling
movies or anything but it's we can we've
we would kind of rely in with that I'm
not having it for quite a while and
bringing it back in so I'm talking about
simple UV scrolling on our meshes being
able to fade those meshes the opacity of
the messages based on distance and based
on an angle so like edge angle fade and
again and also a soft particle or
similar to soft particles have them fade
as they collide with other geometry it's
just another tool in our Arsenal it's
also something that we can give to the
to the to the artists and they can they
can make these these meshes themselves
it kind of empowers them there's some
conversation about that in the monthly
report this month that went out and I
think there's actually a video cool yeah
a report if I'm not mistaken I don't
process those anymore so I'm not as
attention to them as I used to be yeah
and it's quite early days with it's it's
as I say it's it's not exactly like
revolutionary but I'm just having it
it's like wow okay we can we can do more
for cheaper as well we've got more
control one thing I didn't show and I'm
not gonna unlock it's definitely not
something lights account as the finale
but I didn't really talk about like the
implementation of effects as much so and
to do it work that's recommend that
these work with the designers use in
things like data forger and scripts and
there's so many ways that we can bring
in effects into the game it's not just
about the effect
it's not just about making really pretty
effects it's thinking about how they
actually are implemented in the in the
world that we're creating I'll just do a
more yeah let's get now jump into my
favorite [ __ ] what's your favorite ship
my favorite ship is the carrot okay as
legally mandated by YouTube comments so
the classic the classic thrusters okay
so this is I think pretty much the first
things I start working I'm gonna join
crg all those years ago I've always had
a fondness for the thrusters the
thrusters so we're using the particle
emitter strength curve it's similar to
the age curve we're hooking that up to
the thrust input so as the as the ship
applies more more thrust depends more
power from the ship it's ramping up the
strength curve it's not just like in
some games that you just see like that
you switch you vehicle on and you've
just got this this just to this either
there or it's not there like
this is a much more subtle and organic
and more natural-looking way of adding
effects I think and I'm just going to
jump out of game I'm gonna find that
effect really quickly and this wasn't I
wasn't prepped for this at all so I
won't take longer so we have the aegis
Claudius thrusters okay so I just drag
it into the scene again thing you can
keep asking me to make sound effects but
it's not going to happen well if I was
just making this if I was just like
working away and I was on my own I
wasn't on being filmed at id tend to
make sound effects when I'm making an
effect it's usually a sign that I'm
enjoying the effect and I start making
silly noises so yeah so this is like the
way that the effect is on its own so
obviously it looks quite different when
you just see Institute but I've got this
strength value here on the on the on a
particle entity and this is the
equivalent so this is when the ship is
idle and this is when the ship is giving
light is requested
full full full simple and it's just nice
that we just got this sliding scale so
we create these effects using the
strength curve I believe I just find a
posse so here you go so we've got this
strength Knuth yes this is 1 this is 0
strength so this is whether the ship is
just idle and this is at full strength
as well and people ie glide people be
looking in this they were looking in
this librarian that we see in all kinds
of stuff there's a few test particles
I've still going here from where we've
been doing a lot of work on like damage
effects I think we brought in the first
the first pass a thruster damage
recently and then we've got we've got
shock diamonds in here as well somewhere
all kinds of stuff it's not just one
effect we've got lots of kind of layers
we have effects that appear just from
coming coming throughout my sphere like
just a sort of shock diamond that you
won't see when you find on its space but
you will see it and when you're entering
an atmosphere on planets so the loads of
store things again it's the kind of
thing that as you say if I think not
everyone's gonna notice to fight that
necessarily but it all adds to the
overall experience
it's not quite tangible but it just
makes it all look and feel better I will
wrap up with a question from Groth Azul
here if you had to pick one favorite
effect so far that you or a member of
your team has done for star citizen what
would it be that's a good question all
your children make I I love the I really
like the God so many to choose from
I love the Idris explosion that we did
back games come yeah we showed the
bracket Gamescom obviously Idris isn't
isn't isn't out there yeah but actually
a lot that effect I love the other Mac
the names gone but the big the big
weapon the big the big railgun the road
yeah yeah the railgun the rogue on it's
not Saturday I got time to just get the
weapon is it a special I would
some really nice things were weapon
effects actually we're starting to kind
of hit a nice groove with the weapon
effects I can't remember the name of the
damn thing oh I'll tell you what I will
show you talking about effects that
really like let me show you this one
yeah that's one then I have to let you
get back to work that is a that is an
impact effect for a weapon and this is a
this is another really nice one this is
a this is one of these yarn Jean
explosions so the this yarn we have a
very we have like I never there's so
many things I was going to talk about
this all cannae the window we have like
very specific textiles so we got a style
guide where we have set like a set of
set of logic and law that we apply to
different manufacturers and different
different alien races so there's this is
a really nice example of this yarn is
that lots of cool noise there which I
was talking about before you know what I
like I love explosions I mean I'm a VFX
I so I cut I suppose I have to end on on
the odd explosion or - you wouldn't know
it's gonna toggle through toggle through
these explosions burn in my eyes yeah
all right yes but I'm the one that has
to explain why I keep these people away
from work for longer than I'd agree all
right Mike thank you so much for taking
the time out of your day to be here with
us and it take us through this welcome I
think people enjoyed it I super enjoyed
it that's it that star citizen live this
week we'll be back next week with
another show check out check with us on
Monday to find out what it's going to be
about I don't know it's gonna be about
but I don't want to tell you just yet
it's just another good one that :
hopefully things work out schedules and
availabilities alright see you later
everybody we'll see you next week figure
