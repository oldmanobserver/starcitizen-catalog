planetary effects. Whether that's
drifting sand and dust in the deserts,
uh blizzards in the frozen tundra, or
rainfall in the wetlands, using the
various surface types covering Star
Citizens, planets, and moons to [music]
create particle effects that can enhance
the look and feel of a location has been
a goal of the project for some [music]
time. That's why in this week's show, we
met with members of the VFX team to
discuss this important milestone on the
journey towards dynamic planetwide
weather and what [music] backers can
expect to experience to some degree on
all planets and moons in the upcoming
alpha 3.8.
These planet effects is something I'm
really passionate about. Not least
because even though it's like a big
effort for the VFX team and and it kind
of brings us all together and we have to
coordinate really [music] well, it also
brings us together with the other teams
as well. So obviously without the
environment art team, we wouldn't be
able to generate [music] ground effects.
So we have to work really closely with
with those teams. audio as well. Like
you can't really have have like intense
weather effects or storm effects without
the good audio that kind of bring, you
know, really makes it feel like you're
in a storm.
That's always been the appealing thing
of working in games anyway. It's it's
working with multiple teams and all
[music] kind of coming together and just
being able to release this product that
is really kind of incredible.
So we were programmers, artists, QA all
in the same team. So we have a lot of
back and forth especially with these
things. It's a process to get to these
results.
The important thing to [music] bear in
mind is that a lot of people see this as
weather but whilst weather is a big part
of that the actual work [music] that we
were doing was planet effects. So one of
the drivers of the effects when we talk
about rule sets one of the main things
that we did there was wind. The surface
type kind of designates [music] what is
that effect going to be. So is it sand?
Is it snow? And then it's the wind
that's actually going to push those
things [music] around. So when you've
got the combination of wind and surface
types together, that gives us the the
[music] ground storms and the things
that really kind of make it look very
dynamic and spectacular.
Surface type we use to uh mark up uh our
planet terrain. Basically, we have a
list of surface types [music] that the
planet can be, whether that's snow,
sand, soil, uh, rock, metal, and then
that effectively takes up the top of our
hierarchy of the planet effects where we
can tie a whole library of effects to
one surface type. And then with
programming wizardry, we can basically
say, okay, well, this whole area here is
made of snow. Let's try and spawn all
these snow effects in the library.
One of the most important things that we
had to do for this was some system for
level of detail. When you're up in
space, it's going to look different to
when you're inside it. Plus, we don't
want to be spawning the same effects
because it's going to be expensive and
we don't want to melt people's graphics
cards. So, from far away, we can define
a different effect that's maybe a bit
cheaper, uh, looks a bit different and
behaves differently. So, we can have up
to eight levels of detail, and the
closer you get, it'll switch out which
level of detail is currently being
spawned. So until you get all the way in
and then that's where a special LOD,
which the fog ling,
which is the one that's immediately
around you. But we can uh fill it up
with the fog LOD, which is volutric fog
that we can change the color of noise,
density, whatever else. And it gives it
a bit more of a full feeling to it where
you had loads of big blowing snow
particles going past the camera. So, we
already had a a whole suit of particle
effects uh visible on a planet surface,
but on its own, it doesn't really sell
the idea that you are inside of that
storm or inside of that raincloud.
That's why it was very crucial to add
another layer of that uh realism where
when you are flying through a snowstorm,
you would see actual tiny molten pieces
of snow on on the visor or if you are
outside of your vehicle would be your
your uh sorry, it would be canopy on a
spaceship but the visor on your helmet
if you are outside. And that actually
binds these two elements together where
you see all these storm effects outside
and then you actually see that affecting
you as a player because it sits
literally on your visor. It affects your
vision essentially which is nondirectly
affecting the gameplay as well cuz it's
not a statistic where the visibility is
reduced. It's actually you having
problems seeing objects. So, I think
that's that's a really nice way of uh
using visuals to drive the gameplay, but
also making you feel as if the
temperature was lowered. It was actually
you've uh in the winter.
So, what's the difference between uh
planetary effects and weather? Well,
really there is no difference in terms
of the effects themselves. It's
basically building a system for
planetary effects that will feed into
weather when we do get dynamic weather
further down the line. The V4 tech
really enabled us to do a lot of that
stuff that we couldn't previously do
with the with Planet Tech V3. Um the
actual the things that drive the effects
are really the important part of this
process. And one of those drivers will
be weather. So what we've actually got
in 3.8 is we have surface types and we
have the wind.
So we have this uh global wind map. Um
this is right now the the the best way
for us to control where there will be
wind and where there won't be wind and
to change wind dynamically. This is a a
texture wrapped around the the planet
and it defines the wind direction and
the wind speed. With this wind map, it's
quite easy to change um for artists to
say like we want to have like strong
winds in a certain position. But we can
also rotate this wind map and that's
what we used in uh Citizen to make the
storm uh appear for 3A. We will also
have these rotating wind maps to create
some kind of dynamic weather uh on most
of the planets.
Even with all the kind of planning in
the world, there's always going to be
things that you realize as you're making
things. So, to be honest, as a process,
it's been really interesting. There's
been lots of new ideas that we've had as
we've been uh implementing existing
ideas. It might have been there's
several examples where we kind of
thought of better ways to do it. [music]
There was new optimizations that came in
that we hadn't really thought about
previously, but became very obvious as
we started to see the effects covering
planets and from from out in space and
things like that.
when using particle system to spawn this
high number of of particles. In order to
do that, we need to implement a number
of optimization techniques. One thing we
had to do was implement a technique
called half rest. And the way it works
is you only render to a fraction of full
resolution. Obviously reduces the
quality. And in order to combat that, we
have uh implemented some uh custom
filters that we apply when we scale up.
And this results [music] in hardly any
visual difference, but uh consider it
boost in performance.
So pre-age particles is a new feature
that we're uh we're implementing right
now. It's going to go in the immediate
future. Right now, when we move a
certain distance away from where where
we were 10 seconds ago, those particles
could still exist, which is expensive.
So, instead, what we're going to do is
you move away, those particles get
deleted cuz you don't see them anymore.
And now we're going to spawn particles
that have already aged a bit and give
the impression that they already existed
um rather [music] than them being born
and aging from scratch, which should
give the impression that the the planet
is constantly spawning these effects and
they existed even though [music] they
weren't in your render distance.
So the work that we've done on on uh
planetary effects through the year
really even from the very start of the
year, it's been a really long road.
We've put everything into it really as a
team. We've been really focused. We had
the kind of high level goals right from
the start and [music] we've stuck to
them. We've been really true to what we
wanted to achieve. Um, it's been a it's
been a kind of long journey, I guess,
but we're really excited to see the
results in [music] 3.8.
Spaceships. For all the various aspects
[music] that make up the Star Citizen
universe, things always seem to come
back to your spaceship. For some, a ship
can serve as a home away from home. For
others, simply a means to an end. Rather
still, maybe just a way to show off to
your friends and enemies. Of Star
Citizen's 160 plus spaceships and
vehicles, it's pretty easy to find a
ship and reason that's right for you.
And the folks at Crusader Industries
have a new offering that they think
you're going to be interested in. That's
why we sat down with John Crew and Paul
Jones to find out more about the
recently announced Aries Starf Fighter.
So the Aries star fighter is another
heavy fighter that fits in our universe
um to complement the Vanguard and the
F8.
So this was meant to be relatively small
craft but with a massive punch and that
in a nutshell was what is what we were
given.
The Aries with its uh size seven gun is
great for tackling large and capital
ships and heavily armored ground
targets. It's the Star Citizen
equivalent of the A-10 Warthog. It also
has a big complement of size two through
missiles held in both external missile
pods or missile racks uh that can be
customized and then it also has some
internal bespoke racks uh that keep it
all internally inside the body and just
feeds them out in a big magazine style
launcher.
We did quite a lot of variations with
guns in different places in the center
on the side. We even looked at going to
an S6, which is only one a drop of one
number, but in terms of meters, it's
quite big. [music] And then when you
went to an S6, the ship then it looked
more like a ship with a gun attached
rather than a gun with a ship attached.
So we have two variants for the star
fighter. Uh one more energy focused, one
ballistic focused that they are full
hull variants. They're not uh just sort
of named variants. The the energy one,
the ion has an energy cannon by default,
but it also has an additional power
plant, shield, and cooler to power that
because it is essentially a capitaliz
weapon on a medium ship. So, it's well
outside the normal parameters for a
ship. So that is quite a difference to
the inferno ballistic version which has
a ballistic repeater sort of gatling gun
on it that doesn't need the extra power
plant and cooler to to function. So it
trades that out for extra ammo capacity.
It has much heavier armor which the ION
doesn't have um because it it needs
those extra components to function. So
it can't deal with the extra weight of
armor on top. So you have one ship with
two different play styles within [music]
the the single gun ship range.
So what did we learn this week? We
learned that the biggest and baddest of
features can often take the collective
efforts of teams and disciplines across
the world. That planetary effects are
the first major milestone on the road to
full scale dynamic global weather making
its way to Star Citizen. And that
crusader spaceships aren't just intended
to excel in their given task. They
clearly want you to look cool as all
heck doing it. For Inside Star Citizen,
I'm Jared Huckabe. We'll see you next
week.
