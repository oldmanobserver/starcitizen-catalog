hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Shawn Tracy and I'm
Dave haddock today we're checking out
the plaza our corpse area 18 with a look
at hollow advertising finding out just
what the projectile manager seen on the
road map really is and getting festival
with some brand new in law holidays but
first let's see how much abuse a
hammerhead can take compliments of the
community sky are Imperium put Aegis is
gunship to the ultimate test
pinning progressively stronger waves of
enemy ships again it's a single
hammerhead and the Tri I team was there
to capture all drama explosive drama
nice so with our Corp coming to the
persistent universe in the upcoming
alpha 3.5 it's about time we started to
take a look at the first landing zone
area 18 so area 18 as you know is sort
of a cyberpunk II neon haze type denser
urban environment that was actually kind
of inspired by New York Times Square
slash Port Authority bus terminal in the
mid 90s when I went to school there and
was probably terrified by it awesome
well and the plaza was a chance for the
environment props VFX and UI artists to
all come together to influence the look
and feel let's go to jake Dunlop Aaron
Anderson
Eddie Hilditch and Simon Bursley to see
how those teams are working to bring the
plaza to life we've been looking at the
advertising for hour 18 it's a huge part
of area 18 to sort of get across this
sort of busy urban metropolis the
adverts that we've put in putting in
range from sort of simple screen based
stuff all the way up to the more complex
the hologram stuff tends to involve lots
of different disciplines just by the
nature of it
they all have their sort of place in in
these adverts the fears hologram which
is kind of the hero hologram for the
plaza that involves props involves VFX
it involves some animation it involves
the environment artists and it involves
lighting
so in the original concept there was a
water bottle and we moved this on to a
camp we thought having a water type
advertisement would be a cool idea but
we wanted to you know give it more
flavor a narrative team suggested we use
fizz which is a brand for a soda can
inside started in the universe so I
checked I swapped out the water bottle
for Ken and the environment teams
collaborate with us and created a more
detailed game and animated it so using
geometry emitter I spawned particles
along each vertex of the geometry which
essentially made rainfall falling from
each vertex using z-buffer collision
I made it interact with the player so
whenever the player walk through the
rainfall it splashes and collides with
them it also collides with the ground
making splashes so there are some though
it should be sort of term generic
adverts which you'll see a few of that
are kind of meant to hint at something
that is a thing but isn't actually
anything so that's kind of a little more
abstract if you have too many of those
kind of more abstract shapes and colors
and stuff though the whole scene starts
looking kind of abstract and doesn't
make a lot of sense so we've had to sort
of generate quite a few adverse based
purely off logos and brands that we
already have in the game we had looked
through the law looked for things that
hadn't really been used very much before
and tried to pick kind of more civilian
things like drinked Browns clothing
manufacturers as a few medical things in
there
once we're happy with that we were to go
through and design the the 2d logos so
kind of the black and white flat
versions of what each brand uses when we
were happy with that it's a case of
going through and making the adverts
we've had a particularly got fun making
new food items torpedo burritos and and
gel Beezer
are pretty cool and hoping that big
Benny will now lose its number one place
to torpedo burritos
it's important to see things actually in
the scene so to start when we see them
in 2d they might look really cool but
when you see them in the game then maybe
they don't fit and they may look a bit
too kind of cartoony or stand out too
much so then it's a case of going
through and adjusting the style a little
bit changing the colors adding things
like chromatic aberration and distortion
to make them feel a bit more a bit more
sci-fi as well what all these
advertisements are gonna sort of add as
a player experience really to area 18 to
make it feel different from other known
as owns I think is is really life and
Colour and sort of environmental
movement then you might have seen any
environments before because we've got a
lot of stuff there to sort of give an
impression of a sort of living breathing
metropolis that we want area 18 to be so
that's what the player can expect thanks
all and next week we'll be back with
more area 18 as our lighting artists
show you how we tie all that together
that should be cool so along with our
core 3.5 brings a lot of new features
the new playable female character the
facial customisation system I think I'm
shooting something on that next week new
weapons flyable ships an updated flight
model and new controls
so alpha 3.5 is set to bring a lot of
improvement to star citizen definitely
but some of the less flashy improvements
we'll hope to make a big impact
nonetheless like the projectile manager
mmm absolutely let's check in with
Thorsten kay for more the main purpose
of the projectile manager is to improve
the performance of our current
projectiles and we are doing that by
improving the gameplay and physics side
lumberyard projectiles are implemented
as entities and in our version of the
engine projectiles are still entities
but they are also using the item 2.0
system that we didn't that we developed
and that gives us a lot of flexibility
the projectiles are using what's called
a blocking spawn and that means that the
program can't continue execution until
the protector respond and that's
generally not a big deal for projectiles
because it's a very cheap entity but it
still needs to go through all the entity
system and then this becomes a problem
if we want to spawn many projectiles in
one frame at once
and so far that this hasn't been a big
issue in the game but people already are
starting to put four Gatling guns on
each turret on the hem ahead and down
the line we want to have even bigger
ships and bigger space battles and then
this will become an issue to benchmark
the performance of our weapons we
created a tester with 200 weapons that
are just floating around in space and
all of them are firing at the same time
there you can already see really quickly
that the frame rate is just tanking down
and when you profile the levels and you
will see that a huge performance cost
comes from creating projectiles and
updating projectiles so to counter that
in the projector manager we first have
to see that the project has actually
don't need all the flexibility that
entities provide and for instance the
projectile it's a very simple logic they
have very simple physics and a very
simple rendering so to optimize and the
creation of the projectile what the
projector manager is to first detects
that it's kind of one of these basic
projectiles and then instead of spawning
an entity it would respond the small
data structure and manage the projectile
itself and then when in learn a new
projector comes in and we'll just put
another put in another small data
structure right next to it and because
it has just then to fill one small data
structure it becomes very fast and
forced to spawning a new entity and then
for the updating the logic like
computers just love small data
structures that are right next to each
other and then when it iterates over it
becomes very fast and for the rendering
our project has actually just a box with
a special material on it so it's very
cheap to render them so for most of them
you just basically render this box with
the modern material and what we are
doing with the project manager is we
bypass a lot of the render logic which
figures out a projectile is visible or
not because often it's just cheaper to
draw the projectile even if it's behind
a wall of course if you have a character
behind the world and you want to figure
out if you actually have to draw it or
not but for projectiles we can skip that
step and through these optimizations we
didn't get nice performance and what's
also noteworthy is that we can
to use the old system so for instance I
can see on larger capital ships where we
have a large gun and that we probably
need a more complex projector at least
put some geometry on it so all in all
the projector monitor shouldn't have too
much impact on the players just provide
better performance some of the less
flashy but really really important
improvements that are being made like
the projectile manager and a lot of
things that go on behind the scenes for
the tools as well as just making the
developers lives a little bit easier
always bring either performance
improvements or the whether that's just
more iteration speed for the artist it's
these small things that are a little
less you know flashy or front and center
but they are just as important to bring
you all the things that three point five
is going to bring you it's cool you like
talking about the tech stuff yeah like
talking about the newer stuff yeah
coming up next we've got a chat with
Adam Weiser from the lore team talking
about how some of the holidays we know
and love today might look a bit
different 940 years in the future
so we've got like like 12 to 15 holidays
for various events throughout the year
but today I'm going to kind of break
down a three of them that are coming up
in the calendar that you've never heard
of you for
the first one we're gonna talk about is
Stella Fortuna and this is a really fun
and joyous holiday where people can eat
and drink and be merry and just you know
spend a day living life to the fullest
and this is a kind of a special holiday
it dates back all the way to the early
23rd century when Humanity was looking
for a way to kind of encourage people to
be brave and to be bold and to venture
out amongst the Stars and they would did
this by celebrating the first
interplanetary holiday by scheduling a
day where they could celebrate on both
Earth and Mars with the colonists there
at the same time and after Stella
Fortuna we have triggerfish which occurs
on April 1st of every year and this is
basically an updated version of April
Fool's Day a chance for people to play
good-natured pranks and jokes against
each other but instead of yelling
April's fool at the at someone you yell
triggerfish this name came from the
non-existent fourth planet in the Magnus
system which residents of Magnus
basically would convince people in the
27th century that there was a fourth
planet in the system that the UAE kept
off the map and the suckers that were
actually gullible enough to travel out
there to try to go find it were deemed
triggerfish and that name kind of stuck
and eventually took over April Fool's
Day as becoming the term for that day
the final holiday we're going to talk
about is packs Humana which is a day to
celebrate former and current members of
the armed services it commemorates a
very special moment back on November 8th
23:08 when the united nations of earth
decided that for humanity to be able to
expand into the stars we needed to be
one species altogether and to symbolize
part of this all the different armed
services from the different countries
started marched from different points in
New York City and converged together
around the Senate building to show that
we were from many-to-one force for the
good of humanity that March is what
would still celebrate it today in New
York City
with the different branches Navy Marines
almost art from different points and
coming together so that is paekche mana
a day to celebrate those that serve the
UAE so again these are just a few of the
ones that you'll be seen in game and I
can't wait to share more with you in the
future
thanks Adam so that was just three of
the holidays that we've been working on
and hopefully we'll be revealing some
more of those as we go on further down
the road well in observance of Stella
Fortuna we have two st. Patrick's
inspired promotions beginning tomorrow
the first is a screenshot contest you
can find out all about up on spectrum
there will also be some commemorative
vehicles with limited edition green
liveries available tomorrow all the
details can be found on the Roberts bass
industries comm website they won't cost
you a hangover and if any you are
attending South by Southwest our very
own Johnny Erskine and J cross are
appearing tomorrow at the Austin
Convention Center you can find John in
room 8c at 11:00 a.m. and Jake in the

they'd love to see you there if you're
in the area absolutely and I've been
told that there's a special bar citizen
barbecue event in Austin on Saturday at
the Iron Works barbecue at 5:00 p.m.

a bit jealous we are the best promo
dudes in the company yeah there's a lot
going on this week is it everything
