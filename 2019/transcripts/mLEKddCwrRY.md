jump points the gateways between star
systems these wormholes through space
bring with them the promise of star
citizen's expansion beyond just a
standard system and at citizencon 2949
we got to see the first successful
traversal between stellar clusters with
our arrival and pyro
from the branching path design to the
volumetric cloud tech encompassing from
the massive gateway structure itself to
the particle Eddie's the player must
navigate within from the lighting to the
VFX and more to celebrate this milestone
we sat down at the desk of assistant art
director Jake Gainey for a decompressed
discussion of all aspects covering the
creation of our very first jump point
and to hear from some of the members of
the team who worked to bring star
citizen's first date way between star
systems to life
[Music]
we've always known it we want to do like
wormholes and jump points some previous
was done I think back in 2014-2015 a lot
of early concepts went out to Chris I
was working with Marcel on the concept
side of things so we've done a lot of
loose investigations first to understand
do we want something big do you want
something this small does it fit into
the law of SC there's several things you
can play with such as you know is its
Farrakhan's its injure calls its square
the very kind of like or call shapes
that you can kind of play with and then
how that thing would operate how you'd
enter it what's it look like to the
third person as well as the first person
so just to get those ideas out there and
in several iterations for weeks right
and then we kind of like settled on what
you kind of saw in a demo so I think
it's a really good opportunity for me to
know show you some of the content live
in the editor maybe run through some of
the processes that we went through to
build this content and just speak a
little bit about our processes this is
the this is the Stanton location bridge
it isn't just confined to one area as
well the cool thing gives us though
don't even notice demo but we we arrived
at the edge of a nebula this is all
contained in the same scene so I can
zoom out of this location
and you can see again this is fully
volumetric so the the approach for this
is using the gas cloud tech that's been
developed I mean it's been developed
super if they're specifically for the
coil but the more that we've developed
with it the more that we've realized
that we can actually start to build
entire space scenes with this and for
the the persistent universe obviously
it's less of a linear experience than it
is for squadron 42 because we're
squadron 42 we know the exact location
that will bring players into these
though these space capes and we'll know
how we're going to direct the player
into them when we're building content
for the persistent universe it needs to
be a little bit more 360 than that eye
needs to be a bit more flexible so you
can see from this gas cloud that we've
got here we can pretty much move it to
any position and we'll still be able to
get like kind of a good feeling from in
the core vibe the cool thing isn't
something that we've done a lot in
squadron 42 as well it's been able to
actually construct these areas with
polygons with the design team to get
exactly what we want represented in the
engine just to show you a little bit
behind the the process and to build in
space games like this with this boy
about Richter we do use a little bit of
Houdini to kind of generate this content
and I can show you this is the obviously
this is a combination of various
different different elements we've had a
lot of internal tools developed by the
kind of the VFX tech team who have built
what we call CI g-cloud tools they build
the CI G cloud tools to be able to
basically turn geometry into gas cloud
so with with this kind of like shape
that you see here this has all been
built our geometry all of my own
preference I've built this and for yes
monks but really you can build this in
Houdini as well and then we're able to
almost sculpt environments with geometry
and then turn it into the gas cloud
afterwards
so I can just quickly boot up the actual
wormhole itself this is a it's a
separate scene actually in the game it's
part of an object containers that we
stream in this in the the kind of talent
we've had like a new entity belt I don't
know a great deal about the entity the
awesome part of this is I should
traverse him through the the wormhole
were actually going into a completely
new system you know we're not faking and
if then here we're actually traveling to
the new system and even even myself
working on this every single day that
still blows my mind I'm still kind of
completely taken aback by the technology
that were able to kind of bring for this
game we had been Perry who's the one of
the graphics engineers in the UK common
and builders of brand new shader there's
already I shaded that the VFX team has
used that it's mostly for doing kind of
like where you would use a particle
effect but you don't want to have one
and that's called the effect transparent
so that has a lot of tweakable slider II
kind of things for them to mess around
with so what we actually did was combine
that with a more traditional shader that
could do lighting and opaque geometry
and that kind of thing and then through
all that in front of Jake and he picked
out which bits he was actually going to
use so then we just deleted out all the
bits that we didn't want to use and then
started specializing different parts of
it to get the kind of details that he
wanted out of it kind of fly freely and
you can see some of the kind of
variations that we have to put on us
this is all this is all real time in the
engine as well like we were kind of
again we're not faking anything here
this is all this is all kind of
constructed and you can see there's lots
are kind of cool variations we built
this for the demo we never actually go
down these roots but conversations that
we had with designed very early on with
Tobias and design we were saying okay
well we have the capability with the
technologies that we have to build
secondary roots do you want the men and
he was like yeah cool put them in we
might not go to hung them but we've got
them and we can explore them in veneto
so it's good to know that in the future
that will hopefully have kind of
branching paths and the opportunity to
go to different locations here
you can see from from here like the
defamation of the surface as we had
their vertex F formation in the engine
before but the vertex defamation that we
had the better that permission by the
way is driving the the kind of uh
suppose the animation on the surface of
this thing the vertex defamation we had
in previous shader work was very uniform
and we couldn't get any variation or
displacement to the way there that kind
of animates on the surface so something
that been put into the shader where that
forest was the ability to pour very
ation and that defamation so we could
get this kind of like overwhelmed we
feel to it and if hidden had something
that really helped us when it came
online and then we had Caleb which is
the principal effects artists come
online and build a lot of the local
particles that we see in little as well
and I actually think that that that
really helped give directionality to the
tunnel when we felt like we were losing
it because of the speed being slowed
down Caleb came in and built these
particles that you see here and I felt
that ball of that back hopefully just in
time for the demo they know something
that kind of tripped us up as well
though because quite late on we had some
feedback I think a very late play test
we've seen quite a lot of feedback on
the first iteration of this thing
because we wanted to feel incredibly
fast which meant I made it incredibly
fast but then you couldn't do to
straight turns you couldn't do a
90-degree turn because the kayak would
100% crash because it like the speed I
had but we've got feedback constantly
that it was like no I want more turns
I wanted more up and downs I wanted
we've got a good reference with Space
Mountain and we look at a lot of YouTube
videos unlike that and rollercoasters in
general especially with this like how
you build up to this like when you go up
before you get a free fall so then Jake
and I we just talked and may change this
to his spline because obviously that
modular set was kind of working then so
we could go to Dini which he worked in
moved to spline around quickly
exported which was a little bit of work
but then we could get it into game and
we could test Vega so what you can see
here on the screen is it's the tunnel
route entirely and so it's from start to
finish the way this began is that tobias
and design would go away and he would
construct the tunnel out of what we call
designer solids so simple primitives in
the engine and then we would come in
afterwards and use Houdini to generate
that into a mesh my first point I put in
my head that I always kept there was
like it needs to be modular built so it
could use our modular take that we're
already building and we're using for
like the rest stops so you can say this
is the obviously the kind of final
generated match all of the chambers and
also if i zoom in here as well you'll
see the obstacles be you know columns
are obviously or as we call them in turn
at the obstacles that you fly between
they're all procedurally generated
across the surface of the tunnel I say
build to the match and it's all driven
by this spline here so what we've built
in the end is we were very very keen to
build a system that we could you know
generate hundreds of these in the future
or to build more and more of this
content and to also have that
flexibility that we needed from design
so design would come online and say we
want like this part of the tunnel to be
a ninety degree turn it's like it's no
problem because you can take the spline
here move it around it takes a little
while to generate but you can see how
straightaway we've got an entirely new
route there and it's procedurally
generated the columns across that roof
it's procedurally generated the chambers
across that roof so we've got a system
hopefully that's got a lot of
flexibility to it we need to change
anything we need to build anything it's
all there and it's all possible and
actually in the end we we had an awful
lot of support from both of the VFX tech
team and also a lot of the effects
artists I'm building the final content
so actually what we delivered was was a
real team effort the building the world
so what we learned this week we learned
that the technologies developed for
squadron 42 can benefit star citizens
persisting universe in new and exciting
ways and that jump points are more than
just connections between star systems to
aim to test the pilots mettle as you
navigate it's Eddie's and Flo's
obstacles and branching paths within
four inside star citizen I'm Jared
Huckaby we'll see you next week
