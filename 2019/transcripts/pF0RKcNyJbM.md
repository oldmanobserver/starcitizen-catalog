hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Eric Kon Davis and
I'm Josh Herman today we're teaching
NPCs how not to run into things having a
quick chat about network service updates
checking in with the VFX team for a look
at lia's cryog geysers and more but
first It's Hammer Time M the community
loves their hammerheads and recently the
Omega protectorate Corporation from our
French Community got 50 players together
for a massive Hammerhead Showdown it's
some pretty cool stuff moving on to
development one of the foundations of
FPS gameplay is creating believable
movement in the AI of the NPCs to that
end the animation and AI teams have been
working together on collision avoidance
for NPCs in fps situations cool yeah
here's senior animation programmer Adam
rowski and Lead AI programmer Franchesco
Ruchi with more recently we've been
looking at improving collision avoidance
with the AI with players they tend to be
really unpredictable and so we have to
be quite reactive
Ive we need to make the animations work
in a slightly different way because we
just don't know what they're going to do
at any point in time but with AI it's a
different story because we sort of look
in advance a little bit and make up a
nicer path for them to follow but
sometimes they need to be reactive too
and one of those cases is with collision
avoidance so we'll have the AI just
nicely moving along following his path
and then all of a sudden the collision
avoidance system will detect that he's
going to run into another character or
run into a player and it will just
suddenly say hey I need you to suddenly
move over in this direction right now or
you're going to have a collision so what
we do at the in the case is like when
the moment is active we allow the object
collision avoidance code to kick in and
calculate of the guys that are around
you where to go effectively to avoid
each other so mathematically we try to
calculate how far are we with a
collision so we basically predict with
your speed and my speed when in time are
going to collide and do we have enough
time to avoid each other and you know
how harsh the avoidance needs to be the
collision avoidance code that we use is
called Oram that is for optimal
reciprocal collision avoidance uh
basically it tries to find the optimal
value for our speeds to avoid each other
we now have it tell The Locomotion
system hey I I need you to make this
adjustment as well as you can then what
we're doing is we're rebuilding the path
around where the AI is moving taking
that avoidance into account we can check
on the nav mesh make sure that it's
looking nice we can change the
animations that they're playing we can
do all sorts of extra planning because
that system knows what's going on we can
then pass that across to the clients and
then the client will just follow what it
says so the hope is this will make them
generally move better stay in sync
better it can decide what animations
would look best and generally try to
rebuild a nice path around the AI and
then be able to keep it clamped onto the
path which is what we're aiming for so
this is what the new system is going to
do and we hope that that will make uh
desynchronizations a less of an issue in
future and there's a few other cool
things that we can do with this now that
we know that they're always clamped to
that path on the Star Citizen public
road map you can find a variety of
features and improvements our teams
around the world are working on let's
check in with lead Network programmer
Clive Johnson who's going to tell us
about some of the upcoming network
service improvements slated for Alpha
3.5 for uh 3.5 the network team are
working on uh object container streaming
stalls we introduced object container
streaming in 3.4 and you may have
noticed that particularly when Quantum
traveling there's a couple of points
during the process where you'll get some
hitches the first of these is as you
leaving your point of origin behind you
uh and all the entities there get
streamed out and then you'll get another
one a bit later on when you're arriving
at your destination and the new set of
entities gets streamed in the work that
we're focusing on is the the network
part of these stores and there's some
other causes but these These are tested
out to other teams there's a few
different issues there and we're trying
to minimize reduce the stores as much as
we can and eliminate them uh wherever
possible the other thing we're working
on for 35 is the async disconnect
refactor um that's basically changing
our disconnection code which previously
assumed that everything could be cleaned
up in the frame but with the is due to
OCS again it takes um multiple frames
now to get rid of the entities uh so
we're just kind of making that code more
robust and that should fix some uh some
server crashes and client crashes that
we've had hopefully an occasional bug
where uh people can get stuck on an
infinite loading screen when they
quitting back to front end as always the
public road map is your tool to see
what's coming up in the development of
Star Citizen yeah in past episodes we've
gotten a look at the cryog geysers on AR
corpse Moon Lia and we explored VFX work
on damage Thruster effects well Daniel
and Jacob from the VFX team are back
with updates on both check it out at the
moment I'm working on two eix assets uh
one is um the snow effect atmosphere
effect and the second one are the
geysers gazer effect is made out of
steam and water the small drop of water
coming out of the gazer are transforming
into snow because of the coldness of the
lyia Moon
the effect is not a easy one to make it
has to look good in different types of
environment in
ecosystems in some type of ecosystems we
have uh much more wind and in less in
others less wind what I did is put some
more speed and turbulence so in this
case uh we have movement even if there
is no wind over there what I was trying
to achieve with the Gaz effect is to
make it look a little bit more different
than the normal ones than the earth that
we see
everywhere this is latest station of the
damage Thruster effects from previously
shown a few weeks ago uh things have
changed quite a bit since then
everything's looking a lot more
appropriate for star citiz and and like
it fits a lot better since then on the
tech side we've had a debug slider
implemented for me to use this allows me
to alter the health of the Thruster in
real time so I can see how the effect
would progress throughout the thrusters
damage
this uh increases iteration time a lot
more and allows me to sort of see where
I would want to have some artistic
flares now and then so maybe when you're
at thrusters at 50% Health we'd want a
bunch of smoke coming out and then for
them on to be really chaotic all the way
up to just before your thrusters are
about to be destroyed so that it's
really obvious you need to pay attention
right now something bad's happening so
we saw those a month ago on ATV yep in
early early R&D y pretty cool it is
pretty cool I like that when we released
that stuff on ATV that we get that
feedback from the backers and we're able
to incorporate it yeah totally I mean
ATV is oh you know it's not just about
updating the news right it's also about
showing stuff early showing stuff often
and then getting feedback and putting
right in development that's true yeah so
I think that's it for this week make
sure you tune in to twitch.tv/
starcitizen tomorrow at 12:00 p.m
Pacific for a new episode of reverse the
verse live Jared will be sitting down
with vehicle pipeline director John crew
to answer your questions about the
recently revealed Argos SRV and thanks
to our subscribers for sponsoring the
shows and thank you to each and every
backer for supporting development until
next time we'll see you around the
