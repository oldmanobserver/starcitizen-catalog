the tavar whilst our citizens lore is
replete with information not much is
known about the visual language that
characterizes them that is their culture
influenced their craft what can we learn
about their civilization from the way
they build their spaceships that's where
the currently in progress Prowler
armored personnel carrier comes into
play we'll have much like the been a
defender before it it aims to define the
aesthetic of our now assimilated
antecedent alien avian adversaries
[Music]
all right so we're taking a look at the
prowlers white box so you'll notice that
we have the landing gear here split out
the rear landing gear we've got a
section here for the pilots and co-pilot
which is right below him and then we've
got chunks of the interior boxed out and
separated out to the side so this is
essentially a block out for us to plan
the work that we have to do this gives
us an idea of where the major problem
parts are for us to focus on as we
actually develop the vehicle it means a
gray box and then further down the final
I can show you where I'm at with behinds
here so on the interior we've got the
cockpit we've got the copilot cockpit
we've also got what we're kind of
calling the component room and so we'll
have pretty easy access for players to
be able to just walk up press a button
the whole wall opens up and then you
have access to all of your components
and just to kind of give you a sense of
how it just looks in relation to the
pilot enter/exit you've got this nice
big hatch that pops open creating a seal
and then you've got the pilot seat which
turns around something that's kind of
interesting about the ship which we're
attempting to do is we really kind of
want to give the cockpits a very
different feel especially for the alien
spaceship so we want all of the ship
movements to be controlled by a single
input this system here can essentially
move in every single direction and
rotation so when it's all set up the
player will be able to sort of rotate
the joystick to the right or to the left
and the entire stack will rotate so
you'll actually see a cascading set of
animations all the way to the front of
the dashboard giving you a bit of an
offset so it'll be really freaky and
totally different than any of the
cockpit we have so I think that's gonna
be really exciting this is the first
time we've kind of shown what the Severn
interior style is so you might be
wondering what's going on here but
they're inspired by birds as a species
we're gonna have shapes instead of
spanned the higher up they go so you'll
notice you have this kind of like upside
down triangular shape and you'll also
notice that a lot of the big supports
here as they travel upward branch out
more and more right sort of giving you
that feel of
both trees and also when you look up and
when you're inside of that space that
noise that surrounds you is supposed to
kind of feel a bit like a nest so you've
got this crazy mechanism in here similar
to the cockpit section which kind of
swallows up the ladder as it comes in
everything kind of folds up neatly
closes up gives you a nice little seal
then you can have four guys ready for
battle Hill what do we have left to do
so if I look at the ship here let me
turn off the lights and I'm gonna reveal
some of the sections so this is the rest
of the interior in terms of the interior
geometry that still has to be built so
that includes my own signal these jump
seats to the ceiling building out and
designing the interior making sure that
the rear hatch is working properly and
seals properly with the exterior and
then we've got all eight of these sort
of jump doors that also have to be set
up properly and sealed at the exterior
then once we marry that with the actual
exterior work which you can see here on
this hatch then we'll have all of the
geometry finished and ready to go beyond
that what we'll have to do is create an
entire material set which is unique to
the Terran and then we'll have to go
through our final pass which is a long
process of adding palms and decals and
materials and texture set everything to
make it as beautiful as possible as well
as actually getting the lighting done in
engine right now this is sort of my my a
preview of the kind of lighting that I
want to do this is just like a lighting
block out so quite a bit more work that
still has to get done on this thing
before it is ready for flight but I
think it's looking pretty cool I hope
you guys enjoyed it
whether it's building ships designing
game systems programming features or
more
the tools we use to build star citizen
are an essential part of any games
development that's why this week we're
excited to shine a light on those folks
who build the tools for our developers
here who then turn around and use those
tools to build the features for star
citizens out there let's take a look
as a game developer that cloud imperium
we use a very large number of tools some
of those are developed by engineers
within each individual team so we
developed primarily two sides one is we
look after the engine at the editor
which is sort of all of the in engine
tool side of things and that helps our
designers and bring together all the
great content and create all the
fantastic locations we see around the
universe we then also have what we call
general tools which are more for general
business process and managing workflows
and they can be everything from
automated testing through to grabbing
builds reporting crashes so for some
more specific examples to tools that you
may be familiar with because they've
been seen on around the verse previously
is copy build which is used by pretty
much every developer every day to pull
builds from the build system that is
housed in Austin so notice - we've also
seen on around the Versys data Forge
which is quite difficult to explain but
in the game almost everything you see
has lots of configuration data so one of
the big great benefits of data Forge it
allows us to have master records and
then varying records and this means we
save a lot of time updating records and
configuring these items that appear in
the game so one of the tools we have
been recently developing over the last
quarter and we're hoping to release it
for general use this quarter is a new
tool called Star Wars and Star Wars is
there to help us manage all the Texas in
the game we did have another third-party
solution we were using but it was
web-based and that caused a lot of
trouble in terms of getting it into the
build managing to get use perforce which
our source control management system to
do versioning
so because it's a desktop application
not only can we provide a much richer UI
which makes a lot easier for the users
to actually get the content in search
the content and organize it all
it also means in the future we'll be
able to link it into the editor so we
can make changes to the text and see it
directly in game either in the editor or
in the client as that text is being
presented which obviously will have
quite an impact in terms of layout of
and styling of the text that you'll see
so one of the other things that the
tools team handled and look after is
automated testing so we probably produce
something like 20 builds every day and
each one of those goes through a suite
of tests to ensure that we get build
stability and we don't see issues
reoccur this has been particularly
important with the Vulcan work we're
doing at the moment because obviously
that's creating quite a large change
across the graphic subsystems or you
want to make sure that what we deliver
through Vulcan is absolutely the same as
we've done with our current solutions
one of the major people who put a lot of
work into it is Matt Jones our graphics
embedded QA as you can imagine you know
we had quite a few problems trying to
test the game especially with the
magnitude of our like a tile like ours
you know we've got a massive universe
we can't remote you know at each corner
at the universe it's just impossible so
what we do is we've got a tool called
graphic fewer tool and what it does is
it runs two images side by side and
creates a he map or which we can then
detects differences between the two
images and it's done by pixel
differences so as you can see we've got
the first map second one third one
cooking BOTS math you see a difference
between those images and now how we get
these is we actually run a sequence
within likes of a test level or within
the mega map itself so if I just show
you a quick preview of the level you
know you can see we've got a lot of
tests around different hallways
different areas to look at
it really brings in perspective just how
much different tech we've got and three
also like obviously break down each
proportion of the tech rather than
having to look at it within the
megamouth you know it it'd be easier to
just have everything broken down
significantly
I never figure out where the issues
actually lie so from there we'll run a
CAPTCHA through a sieve are as you can
see it goes pretty swiftly all right so
we can get about 180 tests done in about
two or three minutes which is obviously
gonna save a lot of time in long run for
testing so once this is done
so if we go back so we've got two
different modes in facts we've got a
regression mode enterprise for those
comparison mode is where this is most
handy this is where the team might say
they've got a clean build they'll run
one of those quick tests where they'll
get the captures then he implement their
code changes then run it again this is
where we can obviously look at the
different captures and see where the
changes are going to actually really hit
as we go through we get the first image
it let me get the second image you can
see there's slight differences already
and then a human automatically display
this this works again you know in
comparison modes where as each build is
made incrementally we can actually then
look at the build changes that happen in
every single builds that were expected
to be a clean build and just make sure
there's no issues basically happening as
you can imagine you know automation
doesn't pick up everything there is a
bit of manual labor that obviously still
has to be put in but this still saves a
lot of time the way this tool works you
know it really helps identify those
problems as we go along rather than
relying on ours now as a malware to try
and discover these issues you know we
can do it within the space of a few
minutes so that's a brief look at what
the tools team has been up to recently
and some of the few dried plants but we
were excited to maybe hopefully show you
a lot more about what we do in the
future so what do we learn this week we
learned that a ship is more than just a
ship when it's the touchstone for an
entire species is visual development
that the tools that make video games
possible are as essential a part of star
citizen's development as anything else
and that citizencon is one week away and
as such this will be the last is C
between now and then but don't worry you
can tune in on November 23rd at about
noon and UK time for the pre-show and an
entire days worth of star citizen
Development updates so for inside star
citizen I'm Jared Huckaby into I'll see
you at citizencon
