they say a ship is more than the sum of
its parts and part of the fun of
spaceships is putting yours against
others in the persisting universe now we
all know the joy of utterly destroying
your opponents in a spirited spectacle
of space but sometimes you'd rather
disable them and leave your options open
like maybe searching through those
ship's parts and that's exactly what
Matthew and Patrick are working on right
now preparing ships for the sub system
targeting of components let's check in
with them and see where they're at we've
been helping out the I FCS team with the
thruster items helping them with the
damage there's about a hundred twenty
thrusters that you've been going through
uh yeah so far so good so the first
thing I did was actually I went through
and I did all the individual thrusters
so now every single thruster item which
has its own health also has its own
proxy which is collision yeah that is a
collision mesh which means that's what
dictates that damage happens to the
asset after I finished all the thrusters
I had to go through every ship and then
heat ship needed to be accessible so
like for example like over here we see
there's a concavity now where the
thruster sits it's that way we can
strike it directly yeah so you could see
that over here on the prospector that
was actually flat now but you can go in
and you can actually shoot it damage it
individually get right in there and in
the debug here we see these green bars
or the health is actually going down as
you shoot basically when we're shooting
the thing these little health bars go
down which are also represented on the
mesh so each individual thruster can
show me where it is
how much health it has and I can see the
damage transfer through that asset into
others and that's similar how players
will see in their MFD they'll see the
thruster glow from yellow and into red
as it's like about to be destroyed
mm-hmm and mains for example have some V
effects that happen as they slowly
degrade they take some damage they emit
more particles so that's kind of how
those are getting set up now no right
now like you have to shoot into these
recesses to actually strike the thruster
right correct but like in the future
we'll be able to shoot through the hole
with our Pierce ability to
and then strike the thruster that's
under the hall when you're attacking
someone they'll slowly degree their
performance and that's kind of the end
result is to create Ward like a dynamic
gameplay flow and you could see in this
mission particularly capped so I had to
go in and sort of chisel the whole back
come in extrude these out that way you
can shoot each thruster individually
same thing goes for the rest of the
ships down the line alright so is that
good is that is that pretty much what
you wanna do all set yeah all right
okay can I actually get back to work now
ever get things to do I got a lot of
thrusters to do the proxies to model the
public roadmap is your tool to see what
features are in active development
heading your way each quarter but
oftentimes some of the less flashy
features can get overlooked I'm looking
at you game object extensions conversion
or at least I would be if you had a
visual component to look at with that in
mind we asked Jen's and Gordon to sit
down and talk with us a little bit about
what client-to-server
actor networking rework means hi sir I
almost got through it let's find out
more
[Music]
the first step for this was the server
decline actor Network can rework so this
is changing how the clients our client
server serves client yeah the client
server this is changing how the client
talks the server when we released on
marine one thing we found this every we
really wanted to improve was lag or the
person perception of like Tim poor
improved the PvP experience currently
were Philly quite assertive and so that
means when I press forward in my machine
and my actor runs forwards to meters it
works out his new position in that
position set up the server which is fine
that's an okay wait in there the
networking and we're switching to being
separate oh yeah essentially on the
server you're just teleporting around
instead of everyone else seen you
teleport around said the way around so
it's no use Excel weren't around so your
experience is degraded rather than every
other player in the server having their
experience degree just about finished
client server the next one server
decline improving the communication down
the way and so at the moment for
instance we've got an artificial core of
a second
rewind time injected into the system and
to try and smooth over note and the idea
is to reduce that significantly don't to
maybe a frame or two so when I'm hunting
you install marine where I see you are
is where you are what you do no longer
bunny hopping around when you're trying
I may turn on your chief this server is
gonna punish you when you're trying to
hunt me in story and yes it will be a
much better experience for you we would
shoot me much easier good so why do you
think well I mean it's an important
thing that we need to be talking about
it has no visuals though I wish to
episode had more of a punch to it a
punch like what do you mean well it
would have been really cool to do a
sprint report this episode but we didn't
me didn't get it in in time camera racer
hmm for the camera
Wendy little button there's been in
camera right there you mean do a spree
report right now that was unplanned and
not in the original host
why not I mean let's do it hey it's our
show here's your sprit report
the EU gameplay feature team continues
their sprint on clustered harvestable
shown here with some test assets
provided by the art teams the new tech
on display here is the ability to spawn
clusters of harvestable entities and
varying degrees of density and distance
from one another and this tech can
potentially be applied to additional
features like surface side my novel
entities and even asteroids in space now
it'll be a while before you see this
tech in the game but this is an
important milestone that lays the
groundwork for future development now a
couple weeks ago in the RSI weekly
newsletter you may have noticed this
image of a new helmet with hologram
imaging coming to subscribers in quarter
three of this year it's part of an
initiative we're taking to revamp the
subscriber program in general
starting with unique decorative items
that you won't be able to find anywhere
else also slated for cuerda 3 is this
Centurion s helmet and to those of you
that have been asking both will be
completely wearable by players the US
vehicle team is working on materials
development for the band new defender
you know follow-up to our segment a
couple weeks ago what you're seeing here
is essentially an untextured version of
the exterior as the team explores a
variety of alien material types that
have to work in a multitude of
environments and lighting situations
finally the environment art team is
continuing their work developing the
shared resources that will make up much
of micro Tech's buildings and interiors
referred to internally as the high tech
common elements set now here's one
potential exploration of what a transit
hub might look like and well these these
trains these trains might be placeholder
they're they're almost certainly
basically that's a hotdog
spaceships come in all shapes and sizes
from the tiny Argo MPU V to the massive
Aegis javelin and beyond their
cornerstone to the star citizen
experience and one of the most
anticipated ships on our roadmap is the
890 jump from origin this massive luxury
ship is being worked on by multiple team
members ahead of its intended release in
alpha 3.6 and Peter it was kind enough
to give us a tour of some of the
interior areas that he's been working on
this week let's take a look
currently on the 890 jump we're at the
final art phase which means we've took
all their gray box geometry that's been
well established and we've worked out
all our car styling and we just add in
all the final text years that lighting
all the bells and whistles that pull it
together now Nova fins in there at fan
alert but what we have here is the fire
area that leads you into the social hub
of the ship this is where you do all
your entertaining so as we go through
your father's they've got your toilets
got your bar area you'll notice here
we've got a little side room and this is
your service lift that the crew who look
after the guests that used to come and
bring you your drinks in your food
really notices it's quite can a bit of a
change of the palate from the rest of
the ship and this is intentional that
may feel more relaxed this is import
from feedback from the 600 community
felt it was a little wasteful with a
space that used the styling it's a bit
more fancy because it's a luxury ship
after all rather than an exploration
vessel like the 600's so that's the bar
area and we go through to the dining
area this room ended up being a little
larger than we first planned and that's
because I was here sir ship wood decks
and changes of knock arms and we wanted
a pool in here actually I was showing
this to a backer he was actually part of
an 890 Club and I can use that to bring
Romi 819 marries and we can discuss our
plan for things planned for
get-togethers basically that's what this
ship is all about it's you your
partnership where you're going up your
mates around you're gonna have fun you
can use it for different things but
that's essentially what it's about so
what do we learn this week we learned
that we're another step closer to the
greater gameplay opportunities provided
by disabling ships instead of blowing
them up performance improvements are
made in a variety of smaller features
that add to the overall whole and the
eight ninety jump is big enough to fill
eight hundred and ninety segments
gonna drag this thing out because we
still have a lot of shows to fill every
quarter to our subscribers will see some
of you tomorrow for our live studio
audience edition of star citizen live in
to everyone else out there in backer
land we'll see you next week
