hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm eric kieron davis
and i'm shawn tracy today we'll get
updates on character animations and
continue our exploration of the
developing flight model with looks at
improvements to ship AI and audio but
first let's check out a recent ship
centric community skirmish our community
continually pushes the envelope on
showing star citizens potential and
wrecks Zillah recently put together one
such example with this 42 person Gladius
battle it's really cool stuff I don't
know about you but I'm I really get
inspired whenever I see those videos
right like same here absolutely I even I
think I even made a response to Chris I
guess we can all just pack up and go
home now yeah because they you know
they're gonna they're gonna put together
these really exciting things and coming
from a modding background myself I
really love the fact that the community
kind of sets up some really exciting
events for themselves and it gives us
tons of ideas yeah is that inviting us
yeah Chris is that is that is that so is
that what we saw there something that
only you could do in 3 4 3 or is it's
like you know like when did was that
yeah we could probably have put that
many ships together I think in earlier
releases but whether or not that would
have been still really playable or
whether you would have had rubber
banding things going on just having that
many entities right in vicinity of each
other and doing you know the formation
flying around the different hills and
things like that that would have been a
lot harder to do in early releases but
now that we've been able to kind of
knock down some of these performance
hurdles I think we've been able to
really give them the ability to do this
totally that's super cool over the past
few weeks a TV has been looking at
different aspects of the new flight
model in development that's right and
soon players will get to begin their
training in this improved flight
experience but did you know our AI
pilots have to be retrained to its
specifications as well here's Andre
Becker with more over the last few
months the ship AI departments has
focused on two primary topics the first
one was porting all the existing
behaviors for ships into ifcs 2.0 when
the I FCS system switched from 1.0 to
2.0
change how you request certain movements
from the shifts it doesn't matter if
that's a player or that's the AI but for
the player that's mostly on the teams
that do the controls but for the AI it
is on us so when they ship in I ship
decides to fly from A to B it requests
different kinds of things from the I FCS
so we had to change the way it phrases
those requests in order to get to the
point he wants to go to there were two
aspects to this the first one was the
code side so things like fly to a
position or takeoff or defend an area
needed to be converted under the hood to
use new type of interface that ifcs 2.0
provides the other part was on the
balancing side since the combat is now a
lot more momentum driven the parameters
had to be tweaked so the ships behaved
properly the other big topic was
gunships since we were touching the
gunship behavior anyway we decided to
give this a makeover for 3/5 so gunships
for us are ships that are heavier than
the average fighter and the pretty major
part of the damage is coming from
turrets so there were several goals for
us the first one was we want them to
behave in a pretty realistic manner and
we also want them to play quite
differently from fires and it was also
important to us that they play to their
strengths so new behaviors that they are
going to circle the targets
roughly 400 meters that's enough to see
them clearly and it's close enough for
them to hit reliably but it's still far
enough that you can't easily get on
their tails and then they will try to
bring the maximum number of turrets to
bear on their target and some of the
time for variety sake they also do a
frontal assault run and they will use
their front-facing weapons and also
missiles when the player is fighting
gunship the critical importance is that
he gets into the gunship the blind spot
to make sure it's outside of all the
firing arts where as chief is fighting
against fighter it's more important to
stay on the fighters tail because
fighters weapons are usually all facing
forwards so yes this thing on the tail
which is quite difficult since fighters
are very agile but for the gunship the
tail could very well be a very dangerous
spot to be and if it has rare
turns on the fighter side we want to
focus on two main things the very first
task will do for this is to make them
more fun to shoot at after an attack
round so once they're done attacking you
and they are breaking away we want to
give the player more opportunity to get
onto the tail chase them and chasing
them will become progressively harder
the longer they are on the tail and if
you decide to shoot them and you
actually managed to get some hits then
they will try to become more and more
aggressive with their efforts to shake
you off so they will present themselves
to some degree for you to get its in but
you will have to work for it so to sum
it all up gunships are a lot more
dangerous than before and they take a
lot more brains to beat fighters are
gonna be a lot more agile and
certain under I've cs2 photo and will
enable your players to get into their
tail and get Hollywood star movements
out of it and we can't wait for the
backers to get their hands on it along
with controls and systems the entire
ship audio experience is being
overhauled as part of the new flight
model let's go to the audio team for
more we've been looking to rework the
ship audio engine for quite a while now
as the system that we had while it was
great at the time hasn't really scaled
with the game and it doesn't take
advantage of some of our features such
as automatic inheritance inside
dataforge
it's quite restrictive as a sound
designer as well because we could only
play sounds on the thrusters and not
anywhere we wanted to on the ship so
with this new system the players will
see much more positional detail and
accuracy and where the sounds are on the
ship as well as allowing us to bring in
the audio vibration component and the
environment feedback component to give
the players even more feedback on what
their ships doing in the state it's in
so this is the Gladius after being set
up with the new audio systems in the new
system we can place emitters that
represent the movement of the ship
anywhere on the ship itself rather than
being restricted to the thrusters
themselves as in the old system this is
useful for properly placing the sounds
of additional systems that were produced
sound when the ship is moving all these
sounds are modulated by different
parameters coming from the ifcs so
spreading the emitters throughout the
ship in a low friendly way like this
results in a much more dynamic and
believable ship soundscape while this
has benefits for stereo speaker users
people play them of headphones or
surround sound systems should hear
massive increases in positional
believability and detail because of the
more advanced audio features in the new
ship audio system we can also modulate
the sounds of ships over long journeys
to represent the sound of the ship
settling into a certain cruise speed
so because of the improvements to the
thruster audio system we now actually
have sounds on the maneuvering thrusters
and the retro thrusters on most ships
which we used to have August we didn't
have the audio features to properly work
with the ifcs thrust output which tended
to be quite spiky which is offering you
SFIL for audio so now if we line the
ship up with damar we can hear these
working
we've also added thrust and afterburner
one shot sounds to the thrusters rather
than just using loops this really helps
to sell the power and the weight of the
ship during large accelerations
[Music]
now if we enter the atmosphere of damar
we'll be able to hear the vibration
audio and environment feedback audio
components working the vibration all
your component works by calculating the
physical force acting on the ship at the
vibration points that we place these
will be after weapons fire impact
collisions thruster force explosions and
so on but one of the main causes of
strain on the ship is atmospheric entry
and atmospheric flight so as the drag
acting on the ship increases so too does
the physical force at these points so
they trigger vibration sounds these will
be more intense as the atmosphere is
slowing us down and we'll settle down as
we reach a suitable speed for the
atmospheric density
so first developers the new systems
offer a lot of advantages and it's
mainly down to iteration time so it now
takes about roughly a minute for the
initial audio setup of a new ship which
is extremely fast and all the time that
we save by that we can just put in two
well details right into detail work and
focus on the really nice cool things in
the game now let's shift gears and check
in with a Steve bender for some
animation updates
take it away bender for animation 2019
is not just about putting in new
features right 20:19 is a focus on
taking the features that we have in game
right now polishing them up and making
them triple a quality shippable things
that are competitive against any other
game on the market when we're dealing
with future development we often get to
a point on on some of these things where
it works but it's not it's not really
shippable it's something that while you
may be able to say pick up a box there's
all sorts of bugs with it right glitches
things popping moving around and stuff
like that and to that extent we have a
couple guys who are focusing on closing
down those sorts of pickups picking up
the boxes how all of the pops and the
things that happen right now when you
try and do that we're getting rid of all
those glitches so that the team can then
lock that down and move on to whatever
the next important feature is
in vaulting and mantling so we want to
make sure that the player is able to
freely move throughout the level he's
able to run you know walk run jump vault
over objects jump over evolved objects
climb up on them and things like that
now with how vaulting has worked before
in the game
when the character would come towards an
object and he would execute a vault if
he was too close
it would it would kind of work them
backwards and then have them go like
this where as near vaulting allows us to
actually have assets which are related
to when he's close enough right so he's
not running necessarily towards it but
he's close enough and he's going over
and the style of those animations is
different than this sort of like a
sliding style over or something like
that ship sequencing is extremely
important from both an animation
standpoint and an efficiency standpoint
so the ship sequencing idea allows us to
now create enters exits and the control
situations and frees up art to be able
to mix and match those so the animation
team is working closely with tech art to
be able to set these things up to be
able to get the enter working smoothly
with now he gets into the seat and then
from there he chooses which control
system he goes to and same thing in the
exit as I was playing the game last year
and I was talking with a lot of
community members we have a lot of
community members that are hard of
hearing or maybe deaf and they don't
interact with with the game in the same
way that someone who hears hears voice
would do so so we engaged one of our
community members to work with us on
coming up with a series of emotes for
American Sign Language so that our
community members who are
hearing-impaired can actually interact
and roleplay in the world
like how they would want to be doing so
one of the really neat things that
happened this morning is Brian Brewer
our animation lead in Austin called me
up and said hey you want to see
something really cool and I was like all
right when he got and he showed me the
characters actually playing the American
sign language videos and I said you
really want to see someone smile you
need to send it to one of our developers
who's hearing impaired and just you know
show him this because we've talked about
it I've talked to him about it and he
was like super excited about this about
this being in the game
and sure enough Brian called him and
they looked at the video together and he
was like I know exactly what this guy is
saying so that was I think that was
really exciting I'm really happy for the
the community to have this opportunity
to be able to role play and to express
themselves in in the way that they see
fit and that perhaps more is is related
to them adding the American sign
language is pretty awesome and the team
wants to add facial animations for emote
so those will be really cool when
they're complete and that does it for us
