welcome everyone to inside star citizen
I'm your host Jared Huckaby now each
week we'll invite you to come inside our
studios and join our developers that
they share their latest work bringing
the star citizen universe to life with
interviews about specific features demos
of the latest game systems that are
currently in development and semi
regular updates on sprint progress from
teams around the world now to get things
started for us this week let's check in
with Simon Daniel as they share with us
their work on a new lighting model for
particles that's both better-looking and
less resource-intensive kind of like me
let's check it out
today we're going to talk about the new
lighting system for GPU particle system
all decoupled lighting
[Music]
it's hard to our ongoing process of
essentially replacing the old CPU
particle system with this new GPU
particle system the difference between
the old particle system the new particle
system is that now we have implemented
some new features which allows us to
focus much more on the visual quality of
the particles then on the performance
like started off beginning of this year
on the GPU particles each particle had
its one single sample of light things
for example in shadows that the whole
particle way either in shadow or not in
shadows now the method we based it on it
is a technique invented by id Tech and
we took that technique and we also
pushed it for further you can see very
nice shadows on the old system if we
wanted to use shadows then we had a huge
impact on the performance so with the
new one there is no worries about the
performance but only to focus on the
quality aspect of the particles lighting
means that we can borrow color from the
Sun from the environment also from the
cue maps and then this will translate
actually in making the particles the
assets belong to this environment or to
this planet so the way it will improve
the player experience because it
benefits the performance so that means
that you running a better frame right
because we have a control how their
solution overall total resolution of the
Atlas that sort of defines the worst
case so so we get more controllable
performance better performance the
lighting will be much better so it looks
better and better performance basically
by the frame rate I feel like it punch
it punch it up right now I don't like
this nearly as much as Shawn Tracy does
this is I'm convinced the only reason we
ever got shot in Tracy to do h-e-b was
because of this this is a is C Los
Angeles soon there's gonna be is C Miami
and I see a Special Victims Unit
spaceships more than just a means of
getting from A to B they're a great way
to
make your mark in the persistent
universe and members of our ship teams
work to bring additional vehicles to
life in every major patch including the
upcoming alpha 3.6 now it might be a bit
early for this but we thought it'd be
cool if we took a look inside the
insides of the upcoming Vanguard series
of variants with our ship teams very own
John Neville so the objective of this
exercise has been to redevelop and
incorporate components into the abundant
firstly behind the cockpit is not gonna
be the component room behind every wall
are you gonna have various things like
coolers shields power plants under the
stairs here we have radar after working
on the component room it was the past to
redevelop the modular interior of the
ship this is the new warden interior
you're gonna have your a little service
station here that you can interact with
the ship with again this has components
in this slot here we've redesigned the
bathroom and all of the storage around
there and then across here you've got a
new gun tree next to these things here
we have the gun racks where you can
store all your weapons in and then on
either side you also have a space for a
locker
thank you for your clothes and things
its objective of this middle room here
was to build a framework where we could
build a modular pod in the sense that
when you buy a Vanguard the cockpit the
component room in the rear room are all
gonna be the same basically whenever you
buy a variant for the ship we are to
change out this middle section here I've
also been working on Harbinger Varian
and the harbinger variant is the torpedo
ship and then here again you've got
space for crew in the bathroom and the
country here with weapons locking next
to it and inside this one here we also
have a big torpedo Bay so that whenever
the pilot is deploying the torpedoes
you'll be able to see these Toby there's
getting loaded down and deployed and
then you've also redeveloped the hoplite
variant which is introducing more space
for storing the weapons away so yeah
like an almost like an armor at the side
here where you put all your assault
rifles and
guns and all kinds of cool stuff and
then also space for introducing heavy
weapons too so you can really kick this
area out and be able to turn it into
quite a versatile Arsenal workshop yeah
so the the objective of this exercise
has been to make a modular Vanguard
which allows developers to build
variants a lot more rapidly in the
future and also it gives the end user a
much more versatile and richer
experience telemetry now Webster's
dictionary defines telemetry as I'm hey
Dave someone so what's going on we're
shooting the shuffle can I help you so
what we did here yeah yeah we don't want
to do it in the stage anymore we want to
be inside development and everything oh
cool that's cool yeah cool
so are you like hosting it out yeah yeah
you know everybody's busy we figured I
do this and it frees you guys up to
focus on like water sleep making star
citizen yeah yeah totally totally that's
cool it's really cool hey come to work
let's go now to kick your Standefer who
can tell us about a recent update to the
telemetry page currently available in
Roberts space industries comm Hey
we recently published an update to this
dashboard that includes a few new
features and some additional filters
that you can look at the data with this
allows you to drill down on the heat map
to see all the data that we display and
divide it not only by the different
resolutions that people are running as
well as the different versions of the
game that we've published in the past
additionally we added some statistics
about loading times for our game the
loading times that we're displaying not
only track your average loading times as
well as you can take a look at the
community's average loading times
divided not only by the different
versions of the game so you can see how
loading times change as we publish new
versions but you can also take a look at
what percentage of the community uses
SSD versus HDD and how
affects their loading times as well
another thing that we've added to the
public to limit your dashboard is the
ability to see or average ping compared
to the average ping of the community so
you can see generally where you lie
along the lines of the average player
for your connectivity and finally we've
also added data about the stability of
our different game versions this is
shown via the stability score which
contains a tooltip that you'll be able
to read more information about how this
stability score is generated with all of
these new data points headed to our
public telemetry dashboard it means you
have an increased number of metrics to
really dig into how your gameplay
performance relates to that of other
players and how it's changed over the
lifetime of the different versions we've
published in star citizen and just like
us as developers we know too that our
fan base is very data driven as well and
loves to digest all of the very specific
details so that's why we want to provide
all this data to you each quarter inside
star citizen will focus on the patch
currently in development but
occasionally sometimes if the stars
align and things work out the way we
hope we can take a look ahead at
something that's a bit farther down the
line like we get to do this week so
let's go now to Robin from the
environment art team who's been working
on additional look dev for orison the
first landing zone for the planet
crusader
orison is quite a unique location it's
the second planet in the Stanton
universe it is owned by Crusader
industries they have created this giant
shipyard it's quite high up into the
clouds that exists out of a network of
floating platforms the main functional
location is generally to create the big
commercial airliners from Crusader
industries it's floating in the air
because of the unique properties of the
planet there we get you those nice
sunset sunrise colors and feeling
everything flows by itself so instead of
making it in space which would require
spacesuits it's like an ideal place to
actually do something like this the key
features are mainly of course the ship
Wharf itself that exists out of like a
refineries dry docks were like flying
dry docks of course housing for the
people themselves to get that utopian
feeling of parks and like a lot of green
a lot of trees and then there's of
course also the flying hub for the
transport because everything is being
transported with trains so we're trying
to home down the key functions that we
need for this apartment I think it's
gonna look quite amazing with some very
interesting views looking out over the
horizon like Sun setting that kind of
stuff looking down seeing this big gas
giant looking like around you you'll see
these big platforms creating ships
buzzing transport that kind of stuff
yeah I think it's gonna be pretty cool
last week alpha 3.5 completed its
journey through the evocati and pichu
test phases on its way to publish on our
live environment to discuss how that
went and because we'll take every
opportunity to have these two on the
show that we get let's welcome Chris
Roberts and Sandi Gardiner to the show
Chris sandy I'm well but you have to
tell me what's going on here what are
they sure yes thank you to our Aussie
fans who organized the croc stuff yep
and set system Tim times and Maltesers
which were enjoyed by the office here as
well as sandy all right so we got a few
minutes with you I want to ask three
points
I've just made its way to life I had
that go well many brave bugs died to
bring us the release and we appreciate
their sacrifice many cups of coffee were
drunk and a lot of late night hours were
burned by the team and the testers or
the community out there working really
hard so last few days games pretty
stable people having some like fun and a
lot of the missions are now starting to
work well which is good so it's nice I
really like watching all the videos
everyone's making and the stories of the
various things are up to it's great
there's been some whispers of a rebound
to the subscriber program coming up
anything we are ready to share just
whispers whispers yes I mean as more of
the game comes online which
three-point-five there's you know we're
getting somewhere then we're going to
revamp and a little bit more in that bit
more better balance - in-game stuff to
sort of out of a you know jump point or
whatever just you need to revise these
things as things change and when we
start about putting things into the game
that has to be okay I'm just saying to
me it's history is over and it's my time
now so just take off
no we will see you so what have we
learned today we learned that you can
make particles look better while costing
less the interior the Vanguard variants
have so much more room for activities
tonometry is great until you see that
everybody else's computer is just a
little bit better than yours and we're
not so far away from the day there are
characters can live amongst the clouds
now if you enjoyed this week's show
you can thank our subscribers for making
each and every one possible and if you
didn't like the show my name is Mike and
Shella and we'll be back next week until
next time we'll see you in star citizen
insights now we're working on it's a
work in progress
