hey everybody welcome to Star says and
live game dev player wearables
I'm your host - I almost said my own
title again huh so [ __ ]
hunt content management oh man I've
messed up my child the second sorry man
reasons don't have to be we are here
with live character artist Cory Johnson
Cory how you doing man I'm doing good
it's been a while since we've had you on
the show a little bit so long yeah and
we've never had you for one of our game
dev segments Cory you work here with the
player art team of the character art
team rather I would just look at it
almost primarily here in the LA office
there was like one member it's not it
not in this office right yeah we have
one number in the UK yeah so it's rare
that we have an entire department
centralized like this but it's really
great for us because I get to see all
your character work from start to finish
a lot of distress and today we are gonna
go through the process of creating a
player wearable in this case a helmet
from concept to implementation right
yeah yeah and a bigger focus on the
actual texturing material worth
attention yeah alright so what we're
using today is our basis is something
you may have seen earlier this 1/4 on is
C and that's one of the new subscriber
flair items we don't have the official
in Lauren name for it yet but we've been
calling it the Centurion helmet yeah
which is I guess a little confusing
people but for us the design is based
off that so it's easy for us
alright so that so this is this will be
a this will be a unique a unique helmet
that's available to subscribers a next
quarter and so you get you get this
concept from from Jeremiah or one of the
other character council artists you know
where do you start from here where you
go for me uh so from here actually it's
not always the case but sometimes the
concept artists working 3d so they'll
hand off a starting point in 3d it's
they smash stuff together so like
there's quite a bit of cleanup and all
that which is totally fine
yeah so like once your my hands this off
I'm gonna ZBrush this is the finished
model but I can show you here so all the
red is the art B already existing low
poly from the odyssey helmet so this is
one of the ones where we're trying to
leverage part of an existing helmet to
like speed this process along so then we
from concept on you know retrofitted and
all this stuff into it right so this
helmet was was was built on top of the
existing Odyssey helmet yeah for a
number of reasons one it's it's just
more efficient to do that when you can
it's also more efficient performance
wise when you can have as many shared
assets and resources as possible my game
yeah yeah so like in terms of any type
of cleanup often when we get things
dobe things aren't quite lining up so
like it's often as simple as just making
things line up and then polishing things
out yeah yeah I almost stayed in the
ZBrush phase but from there once that's
all good and happy jump in a program
like top of gun or Maya to read
apologize a topo gun this is what I
haven't heard it before yeah yeah it's
it's literally only for making low poly
so it does it pretty well is very
focused program so what are we looking
at right now what would it split it why
is half of it and this weird because
it's completely symmetrical you only
need two you only need to make half of
this and then once it's is good I'll
jump in Maya mirrored over stitch it
together and move on but I can show you
it's as simple as this you just end up
building out
parts of it like this and yeah it's not
the fastest part of the pipeline but
eventually you get to this point
the other big thing at this point is
looking at the concept compared to the
low with our texturing pipe
we're masking with blend Maps which is
which is texture based but we're also
masking through geometry to block out
some materials so at this point it's a
little you got to keep in mind how many
subnets they're gonna want how much you
want to break it down okay I'd take
daily that what's what's masking yeah so
I can show you a little bit easier so
each one of these colors is a different
subnet and what that means is it gets to
use four channels up a blend map for
color so when you're looking at the
concept you got a take a moment to
really plan out how you want to cut the
Gio up because sometimes you end up
getting into game when you're texturing
you're like oh actually I can't really
accomplish what I won I also go back to
the low poly stage cut some more gon
break out this piece rebuild your
material and then continue forward like
that so that's not it's the it's the
only part where you're like really have
to like think about exactly what you
want to get in the end so it's not just
you just take the image that Jeremiah
doesn't recreate it in 3d there's you
ever talk about Moore's earlier before
we went live and let's go ahead let's
get to the technical stuff because when
these types of shows that's really what
we're here for we want we want to learn
want to learn a bit more about how this
process works no you talked about
separating the Geo's you know there's
things we go back to that one with all
the different colors and why do we
separate into that many pieces uh
basically so this one's pretty I took
this one pretty far in terms of
separating it partly because I wanted to
make the texturing side just faster so
like what that means is like so this
yellow part
if I wanted to texture it as far as like
oh it's gonna be like looking at the
concept I'm like an exposed metal but it
has some edge wear and stuff like that
by breaking out just this piece I get
four channels for it so base layer would
be like a brass and then I could start
to build up other materials on top of it
so the further we break the stuff down
just the more complicated we really go
with so each colored area gets four base
layers you vote for base layers or four
layers including a base yeah like four
masks that in each mask is it could be
four color tweaking the material like
each mask has the full gamut of what we
can do so they're gonna sew each part
allows you four levels of custom of
customization with AC oh yeah eighteen
for lack of a better word yeah the way
to think of it is it's basically we're
using an RGBA and the Alpha is the base
layer and then it's we're just stacking
up materials on top of that okay so it
goes alpha Ben blue channel a then green
then red and like with that there's the
methodology of you really one
whatever taking up the most room try to
leave that for the Alpha Channel so
you're you're continually getting
smaller on the actual texture coverage
as you go up that pain um yeah just cuz
like it's neat it's a easier way to work
yeah so like once you know you spend a
decent of time doing all this business
coming to Maya doop it over the other
big part of this is you be mapping these
aren't very good you these I'll admit
that I was trying to be fast I forgot
this I I've been here a little over four
years I'm hanging out of character team
most of that time UV mapping and stuff
this is one aspect to this I have
virtually no understanding about like I
look at this and I don't understand how
this applies to the to the thing and I'm
not saying that for the purposes of
teaching the show I don't get it yeah
help me out here looking at this piece
this blue part this part here you'd be
mapping easily just trying to get your
geometry laid out as flat as possible
right for what end so that when you when
you do apply textures and details like
that it doesn't warp and get all crazy
so I can do something like this so you
can see here there's a it's not bad
warping but it's a it's a bit you want
these squares to be as square as
possible all the time because anyway
anywhere where this is warping like if I
if I put a material that let's say has a
lot of like vertical lines mm-hmm you'll
see that the lines will start just it'll
show up really like in not a great way
in the game because I'll you'll see that
skewing that way yeah
so so that's what you ving is all about
getting so it's almost like I'm in like
a clicker
when people do wraps on their car they
get these comes in a big flat thing but
when you look at it all flat it's
weirdly shaped and huh yeah yeah and
then when but it's but it's because
they're anticipating all of the shapes
and curves of the car and they're flat
printing
yeah something else is a difficult paper
craft there's websites for it where you
can basically get different plans of how
you cut something out and then fold it
together and then you have like a little
character or something like that it's
it's a exact same stuff yeah so the very
important phase is because textures are
2d and you have to apply it to you
texture to a 3d thing yeah so okay yeah
I don't know it was my car wrap analogy
good yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's
taking something that is flat and but
needs to wrap over a surface that it's
not flattened anyway yeah so you kind of
see how it's all broken down based on
the sub maps I set up I often try to
also have my UVs cut out that way it
just makes texturing easier because I
can do texturing things based off of
what my UV unwrap is so just an
efficiency thing
yeah so we got this guy and then we can
start to jump into texturing it'll be
something like this which doesn't look
like a lot but can we can you see how we
make a change to that flat you be
mapping how it applies to here we'd see
how it applies I can attempt to but I
don't have I might not have that working
file anymore
okay but I can probably get it to work
let me
so with substance painter if I exported
this in there mm-hmm it wouldn't work
very well because every different
material I have applied in painter would
show up as a different texture set so
he'd basically break out with a Geo as
you see it here and that's not really
okay
usable like that so stretch Nikhil says
a good UV is the difference between easy
painting and texturing and oh my god my
design is getting broken up even though
I'm drawing yeah it makes a huge
difference but you know like as you
start to learn where you can like speed
things up and be a little bit sloppy and
get away with stuff like if I know a
material a spot on the UVU's will never
if it'll basically just have a very
noise material on I probably get away
with a decent amount of slopping UV work
just because it's noisy and it's
slightly stretches you just you'll never
see it so I'm gonna have some wearables
we plan to have ready at lunch so that's
not a consideration that we do hear of
it at this level we're just we're just
making as many things as we want to make
for the game so pretty much pretty much
it's not it's not it's not like it it's
not like you you set a quota and then
you give that closer than you relax it's
you just work and we're gonna add and
work and add and work in Adam yeah
what's the next thing we can do gray
hard-ass why if the helmets so narrow
will a head fit inside no for sure so I
don't that's not whether the engine
right this moment be but I can showcase
of here
it's also we're also missing a body for
scale at this point so yeah so you've
got you so I mean because it's built off
the odyssey helmet like all that stuff
was figured out here yeah the head fits
in this helmet so but I can pull in the
our base male head it is the virtue of
building off of a pre-existing asset
since it's all been worked out for the
Odyssey and the honestly I was in game
when it's functional we know the head
fits in it building over the honesty
saves us a lot of time with the metrics
so you can see it doesn't look like it
but we actually have ton of her with
this helmet this is of course for a
normal-sized head and not a gargantuan
melon cranium like me for sure and then
I mean in real life helmets are actually
ginormous that's padding tons protection
what is this is this that we're seeing
over to the right here this is this this
looks like I don't know I'm thinking
that head and toe to recall it so I feel
like people have definitely seen bugs
around this where they see like a human
face stretched across objects this is
this they're our base males UV layout
and all the heads actually have this
usually no so the same thing we were
talking about with that with the helmet
but he said yeah all the different
pieces it's one giant yeah yeah this is
pretty that I mean this is the usual
setup for doing any kind of head stuff
you just want to maximize the UV space
as much as possible and as you can see
there's like towards the less important
areas which is like the back of the head
mmm you allow for quite a lot of
stretching just cuz I'll have hair and
hats and all kinds of things you'll
never really see it so yeah I was
watching wherever you're watching we are
taking questions live during the show
you can submit your questions with the
word question he kept the letter
surrounded by brackets and I'll do my
best to pick them out for the jet
throughout the course of the show
yeah so like just to break this down
real quick
this looks like it's just much noisy
stuff but what these channels are doing
so for these areas I made the assumption
like okay these would be painted metal
but I don't want it just to be too flat
but paint a metal so ended up adding
just this noise in and a good brushed
kind of thing
yeah it just it's just something to add
a little bit of like a once I go in game
you'll see it's it's really subtle
speckling and then for areas like the
green stuff
these are exposed metal so based off the
concept I was like okay it's gonna be
bronze but it'd be probably look good to
do like some slight edging and then I
using gold to edge it just because it
helps pump it out over boy I like that
the top work those along the edges there
yeah yeah and like I can showcase just
some of the fun things painter does a
substance painter wearing right now yeah
it's like you can do very fast things
like adding a generator it's like our
fourth software so far just for the head
we're just for a helmet so a lot of
tools character uses a lot of stuff it's
just how it is it's like you can see
here as quickly is that like I have all
this edging that I can then start to
tweak further that's like really the
huge power of substance painter is it's
a completely non-destructive workflow
what's happening
so like normally when you would paint
like I can make a paint layer here and
then this would be actually I'm painting
but now I'm like oh I don't like that
it's just a paint layer so it's flat I
can't really do anything with that but
with something like this you drop down
to fill there
at a mask and now I'm actually doing all
the work through a mask right so this
paint layer is actually just flooding
this with white for the mask is actually
driving where stuff can show up
so like I have this but then I can come
in here at a paint layer drop that down
switched us to multiply and to get this
multiplying nothing it doesn't show up
but now we can start to bring in like no
I just wanted to show up in these areas
mmm you know I mean in a drunk it's all
about like I said non-destructive so you
can do so many things just back and
forth with this like oh I don't like
this paint layer I can switch this on
top and see what kind of result I get
and coming here out of
I switch this to multiply it is for
picking up radio transmissions you'll
get you know you'll get EC an alerts
choices fast clear percent that's what
the actually at no I don't think that's
with us maybe eventually though yeah
yeah yeah so like this step can get very
complicated or very simple because I
broke up the subnets to as far as I did
this set up for me end up being very
simple so then all I'm driving out of
this is exporting the mass out those
going photoshop and we get another one
of these yeah so this black and white
mask is literally what I was deriving
out of there and then these will be
compiled into the actual blend map and
the blend map is so here's our if my
channels right blue green red and then
alpha always exists because it's our
base layer so that's why it's not
representative right so substance
painter exports this it gets it's like
how do you this like part that I would
like do both working magic doing like a
egg hatch how do you know in this square
where any of this is going on the helmet
uh yeah so I mean like looking at like
this yeah obviously that's kind of
confusing but so what this is here so be
and be one in relation to substance it's
these two layers be one it's okay so
substance layer is exporting a square
yes we're so it automatically takes what
you've been doing in 3d happens it out
into a square I mean I can I can
showcase it like this oh so here is my
UV layout and get rid of the material
responds yeah
it's likens thought I mean this isn't
really useful to work in this video like
this but yeah yeah yeah and then
Wow yeah yeah we actually we work
completely in 4k that's not what we use
actually in games that's way too
expensive but that's we always work at
that source level it's it's amazing to
me that it's the sister takes all these
other pieces and they're not just finds
them out but then finds like this
efficient way to fit them all into a
square well like so this is all just
derived from what I did in Maya right so
yeah so you had - did you have - yeah
yeah this is all manual ok something
extremely frozen
it's like extreme packing I didn't do
this manually are you bringing a process
like I said I was writing fast cuz like
normally what you want to do like if I
was doing a clothing asset like having
everything skewed like this isn't you
usually don't want that because then
fabric you know like my shirt it's
running very horizontal now if all my
stuff is skewed you have to think of
like on a monitor that how the pixels
are drawing we start to get weird
anti-aliasing so a way to avoid that or
minimize it is make sure you're you
these are laid out up down left right
like pretty straight but forcing like
this I wasn't worried about done yeah so
in Photoshop get these compile it out
export that out and really it's just the
liver normal map I into - earthenware
answer was asking how helmet attachments
would play into this I mean essentially
that man that matte mask is one giant
attachment I mean the way it's built it
really has become its own helmet if
we're gonna talk about like helmet
attachments or something like this it
might end up being you know cuz we're
like we're just gonna add stuff to it if
there was some kind of like
I don't know this attachment gives you
zoom in vision and when it some kind of
like SpecOps optical thing off on one
side mm-hmm it would end up adding we
would build that specifically to this
helmet so that it can fit in
appropriately but they're still a
separate item it's maybe a separate item
and instead of the separate item for
this specifically because like because
our helmets are such varying shapes
there's no way - there's no other way to
go about it we'd have to do it unique to
the helmet what's in the end is I think
the way we've gone is totally fine
because you know like Oh a SpecOps
optical thing you wouldn't want out and
they explore it wouldn't make sense
unless it's something that literally
sticks out on the side or sticks out
from the top like a GoPro yeah like
maybe like it's a small antenna type
thing could be a decently uniform but it
all comes down to like how much that
attachment actually touches the helmet
so like something like that yeah sure we
could just like make make up something
very generic for that it would just be
position would be driven by a joint it's
like somebody stick up a giant boba
straw into the head hey yes we can do
that yeah yeah so then go throw
texturing stuff explore all your maps
and then going into the actual engine
and then single materials you'll arrive
on something like this what does that
mean Oh Graham number 6 JD is counting
the number of times you use just to make
a helmet I mean we could definitely
Institute actually there is more like
Marvelous Designer that's where that's
for simulating cloth and stuff like that
which obviously is a hard surface so and
not every minute some some have drones
yeah for sure
yeah so like coming to this step the
actual material setup
it really just you just start playing
with stuff once you get here and as you
can see each layer is deciding the
material the color the actual titling of
that material and then the actual cost
and these are the four layers that you
were talking about before when you
entering you sell these all the pieces
yep so now how many different on this
helmet at this point how many different
pieces are there to customize so in
terms of setup yeah all that one to 15
15
so this helmet has 15 customizable p15
sets of materials each one of these are
yeah so we also use obviously glass if I
have the glass in there it would it
that's not something we'd use beware
blend maybe the actual glass material
this helmet doesn't actually have glass
this one does so we use a glass material
as well and then we also use the looms
sometimes because then we can do Chloe
stuff like this so looms a specific
share all these stuff yeah yep so we
actually in terms of setting up clothes
we can do it now through layer blend or
we can do it through a loom the
advantage with the layer blend glow is
you get to do really fun stuff because
it's texture based let me find it part
so if I turn on whoa
this might be a really tiny part check
for those watching on twitch give me a
give me a base color we're gonna for
gonna color to this already color this
give me that give me give me a base
color to start with the primary color
for the over for the injera is like -
well alright that went fast
hot pink now they say though and I
already have a hot pink one you already
have a hot pink one yeah let's not let's
not spoil it let's it's it's do the
process then we'll go okay we can run
through it yeah so in terms actually
doing material variants I usually start
like top-down and just start tweaking
stuff so pink it's pretty aggressive
it's pretty that's like that's like 1986
in it that's long right there the other
thing we can do is so like the
double-edged sword of our material
variants right now is when we do them we
are dipping the entire material we're
not just isolating like oh it's just
this part in that part we change the
color like a lot of games do that right
like you have very specific limited
areas where you're actually put it into
bold and like where you can actually
change them because we are duping
material the great thing like for the
character artists and everyone playing
we get to change everything because the
only material so like we can take as far
as with one so something like this I can
we have this bronze material here so I
can swap that out where is that actually
showing up is that just thing so like
that was bronze and I can do that
and I know it's glowy bit right like
it's I think as extreme changes we want
we can do that stuff
we make this big pink buck here the pink
eye give me a second color jet what goes
well with pink as well somebody few
colors I can go so we asked if we get so
we actually we have a randomize button
for this no we do not and like sort of
like the reason why we don't have that
every helmet how its set up is very
unique to that helmet right so in terms
of randomizing there are directions we
can go in to get that functionality but
it's super fuckability
so purple purple uh yeah so like this is
the other jiggy can we see this so this
is one of the things that happens you
guys for this sit there now character
references are color references yeah
what's the kind of reference and way to
use it uh yeah so like this is a
Pinterest board it's my own web when I
set up yeah it's really just like you'll
start to see like oh here's like a clump
of purple stuff there's some green stuff
there's some white and gold like yeah
it's all just giving yourself something
to look at and then another comment give
yourself a direction to go in like I
could just sit here not looking at
reference but this this gets a result
faster and you end up with more ideas so
it to like run with um and there's stuff
from all different styles here
yeah yeah but you could because you're
not looking you don't matter it's not a
question of whether it's a manga or
sci-fi or fantasy where as you're
looking for color combinations pretty
much yeah yeah they you can see here I
have an eye like it's all over the place
literally just oh actually like it's
cars together expressly if I had a
section of pink stuff yeah yeah so we go
with pink and purple that's not too
obnoxious
well we've never concerned ourselves
with being too obnoxious here and star
citizen like wait absolute how
aggressive pink and purple are we
talking you guys want something like
toned down or you're the artist do
something that if you if you've now had
the direction to do something pink and
purple but yeah go with your own
personal carnations at this now I'm
gonna go aggressive let's go let's go
that's already tiny
well what would Cory do with the design
brief make it pink and purple I want to
yeah I want to see what your process I'm
not always a huge fan of like obnoxious
colors in video games but I do like that
they like I want games that have it
right like I want to have the option if
that's what they're into um yeah so I
can show it actually show real quick all
that speckly stuff I was doing in
painter right so like here it is so kind
of doing things like this so I pulling
in just a little bit of pink and it's
subtle but it you know it just adds that
little bit the other thing that gives me
is actually playing around with the
actual gloss value it's right now that's
just the the spec response right so just
to build up like some of that variance
in there yeah and then like from here
it's really just okay I kind of like
these two colors and then I'm just going
through and replacing areas with those
colors
for those folks who have been asking
basically feature related questions
remind you that we're sitting with an
artist now feature related stuff for the
are the areas of designers and stuff
like that the system designers yeah so
we don't have the right personnel here
to answer future questions I guess like
it asked me what I would like but I
don't know that's dangerous
I've known you long enough that I'm
absolutely not going to ask you fair
enough
very much yeah so you can see like this
area you know it's this it's a subtle
thing but it yeah it adds quite a bit
like the pendant is underneath and then
they painted the purple got somewhere
down so the Purple's wearing down and
exposing the pink underneath yeah you
clarified it why you thought the UV map
that you had for the helmet Maya
wouldn't have worked well in perceptions
painter I mean no it worked fine because
that's what I did work off of all I'm
really saying is like this is sloppy
like this giant piece me letting it be
this giant piece not very efficient like
I could have cut it here and then made
instead of it bowing out made a little
bit straighter and I could pack a little
better so like if we look this is it
this is the Odyssey helmet
much better right much better layout you
know I mean even just visually you're
like okay there's a this seems oriented
better this kind of chaotic yeah and
this step rate comes down to the artists
like what they're willing to try to get
away with to save time no I mean like in
the end you know we're trying to a lot
of content you make a good point you got
to learn those corners that you can
sometimes come even at a point it's very
easy to go deep into the weeds I'm just
one thing
so it's people often lament how long
video game development takes and a lot
of that is knowing when to stop and to
move on knowing when knowing when you've
got it it's like do I got it yeah I
could probably play with this another
you know four days but I've got it here
you know and knowing when to go to the
next step it's a it's a difficult
balance I know there's a famous quote
about how art has never finished it's
only ever abandoned and if you looked at
oh sure yeah yeah certain certainly
agree with that do they like the gold do
you guys like the gold I like the gold
I don't even ask what these people like
more shiny so I like the gold
hey sometimes its perks to having your
own show yeah like so this is like
people just feel my my people your peas
people are my people so I claim your
people one of the functionalities like
if you guys see me like just sitting or
clicking on a sub mat I'm doing that so
I can see it do this where highlights
mm-hmm
like the actual part because it's very
important to have that because often
like I I made this helmet so like I'm
texturing all that sometimes you'll end
up doing two variants or doing other
texture stuff with someone else's
absolute just if that's how the
scheduling works out so it's super
helpful to get a look like coming to a
setup that you're gonna do like I don't
know where anything is and go to you
know find those things a little bit
faster somebody asked you can't find the
question now but something has to
disposable to do a transparent helmet I
think I wouldn't man you got so
transparent glass thing on that yeah I
could I could make this all class we're
not gonna do that today but so I didn't
do that a while ago I made actually made
an old glass everything armor on her
suit helmet just I mean I did really
fast and it was really fun we were
joking it's like oh we'll give this to
devs only it'll be a predator see it'll
just be these creepy devs in the
background wearing their full class
armor but the only issue with that is
like it would
they still show up your head in your
body so you just be a guy in underwear
running around with some glasses over
you
so I'm not the coolest I'm not even
looking at chat I know there's at least
200 people that don't have a problem
with that I didn't have to look at yet
hey man you guys throw it out there or
maybe we'll push that is that dangerous
to try to get them to we want glass
armed so oh what do you think the club
last armor is the steeple of it Moses
I'm not entirely sure about that - yeah
it is fun mantis asks if the screws in
the helmet are actual geometry or is it
a normal map for something a little bit
above so these ones it's not very much
Geo
but there's something actually like you
Mike made an indentation in the Geo to
give it something yeah so basically I
did the indent and then I did the dent
up because we see right here the way
light reflects light plays yeah it helps
coil change if it's any smaller than
this I wouldn't have done that because
it would just be way too expensive and
not really worth it yeah yeah and like
this is another thing where it just
comes down like the artist Cole like
sometimes to justify sometimes it's not
it just case-by-case
yeah I mean here's we make Mohawk things
let's go let's go in that direction too
it's like here's another thing we're
like this top Mohawk part is bronze
right now mm-hmm and because we have for
freedom now it's painted metal you have
an entire materials library I believe
that we've kind of built up over time
yeah and actually recently we had one of
our parents our artist shame going
through and actually updating that so
pretty soon we're gonna start to roll
that stuff out just we started to
rebuild on materials just to bring more
of a standard to it mhm yeah cuz like
one of the issues with like not having
strict standards within the material
library one material base diffuse gray
value might be 170 other one might be
210 so when we're multiplying color over
it applying this purple purple
multiplying on those different grayscale
values is very different one's darker so
right that starts to get annoying so
like weird unifying all that stuff out
and yeah that's one of the advances in
the unicorn horn would really make it if
you ask todd papy he'd probably approve
that I mean it's a good style come on
right to Jimmy that's her my camera you
sure anymore who gets another so you've
been playing yeah you've been playing a
bit for the show just to see what we can
do as far as the different types of yes
yeah so orange creamsicle
big fans orange white is awesome
together I really like I'm a big bad the
orange creamsicle because it reminds me
of the clone troopers in the Clone Wars
yeah person personally yeah yeah that's
what it reminds me of yeah and like so
the here I can showcase here's the og
helmet and make this big yeah there's
more the screen here which is more there
we go
I never tell you I'm gonna drop this
deal if you don't
a little bit nicer here we go like as
you're making these the wort
when you're using like the base metals
it really starts to matter base metal
compared to colors so like with the
creamsicle having the bronze it just
just I don't know like it starts to not
work so like that's why I swapped it out
to like this brushed steel and like yeah
we're about to take it that far and how
do you determine if an asset is too
expensive does that come from
Spencer somebody else is that something
you have to you have to do chá yeah I
mean it comes from a lot of apartments
for us we have some base guidelines we
try to stick around
CryEngine allows for like some pretty
wide ranges so it's it's not super
strict in a lot of ways if we put
something in we're like oh this might be
a little too expensive or whatever
sometimes it's better than we see what
happens but we do have profiling tools -
okay that's isolate this helmet if we
can we can yes we can - right exactly
how many drawer closed how expensive is
geometry how expensive are the texture
perhaps like we can get all that
information
yeah the profiling tools we've got QA
we've got yeah multiple levels of
engineering we'll get involved like if
there's a like oh we're releasing a new
landing zone both NPCs are really
expensive like you know like like it's
oftentimes in situation where you're
like okay but why isn't why here why why
why these characters and like you start
to investigate further name I'm setting
up a bot he'll hold up here got it going
now folks in chat numbering one through
six from left to right so the blue one
is one the red is to the creamsicles
three the bumblebee is four and there's
also a great combo you tell me which one
if only one of these could actually go
in to get you what would it be
obviously take a closer look it would
just be all it some hints of red in
almost on what it was this little red
symbol thing that's on the side that's a
little bit a little bit there yeah so
this is from the original right that's
our cycle mark that attached it to the
vas huh yeah honestly that I get to be
captain and they got something different
like other helmets where it's like yeah
I really might just be a bit that even
see move on oh yeah I mean do they want
to see me make a different variant or do
I'm gonna go more than ready this is
pretty evenly split here there's a lot
there's a lot of people 5 and 6 is
splitting the vote between itself
there's a lot of people that like the
neutral colors because it's gonna you
know and neutral cars would go with more
things yeah for sure
but there's there's a there's a lot of
folks who like the strong red yeah
there's blood prophecies he doesn't like
in you something trend should I show
more shirt what else you got
so when I made these we have a base list
of 20 materials that we I mean you can
see it here mm-hmm
yeah we often make now in terms of what
goes in game that there's like a further
layer of like art direction of like
these are the ones that the art director
ended up really liking so we're you know
end up going in that direction but the
roads not taken yeah the roads not yeah
so like it yeah I mean like the teal one
this is actually a blue variant and one
of the artists was here is like doing
baby blue and pink is really good common
like sure I'll try it out why not yeah
and then like purple and going black
usually look really nice this is the
pink berry and I landed on and then back
here it's like here's a black bear hands
so like in this one I got rid of almost
all the glows it is that the just moves
by the one that's reflecting on the
black one yeah that's cool yeah so it
actually is glowing actually is doing an
emissive something yes yes in the
reflection of a you know reflective
services around it will pick that stuff
up there's a super nice looks cool that
one's the and the Oregon hipster
unnatural yes recycled materials yeah oh
hi Jake P oh my god I apologize yeah so
end up doing like a full list and then
refine that down and potentially slip in
one of these
yeah that's cool all right well that is
actually it then it's actually it for
our show this week everybody thank you
for tuning in
a brief much shortened and abbreviated
toward the entire process that that our
character our teen goes through for just
just a helmet you can see it's one of
those things it's a it can seen we're
talking about this before it can seem
easy and there are aspects of it that
get easier over time as you build
material libraries and build all your
boxes like that but the but though the
work to get to this point the work
needed to build the process is to build
a pipeline to build the material
libraries and stuff it's we're standing
on the on the shoulders of a lot of the
work that came before no for sure
yeah it's like it's a constant thing of
trying to find more efficient ways to go
about these different processes so
something I am end up doing when I'm
making material variants
I don't do pout the full 20 and go from
there mm-hmm first I'll make like okay
I'll make the first one which is red and
the way I think that is basically like
theming so kawaai step this red one I
kind of like where all the colors are
falling in terms of like a slightly
darker red black and that so that once I
make that I can then dupe a few
materials out of that mm-hmm
and then when I'm gonna set those
material variants all I'm doing is going
oh the dark red and I'm gonna switch to
white oh the light red I'm gonna switch
to orange so like at that point that
gets really fast because this replacing
and like throughout the list of 20 I
find a few themes and then go from there
let's give it up for Tim who's just been
standing there very still this entire
times yes the perfect model Tim it's
what that's where the phrase tipos comes
from maybe I pretended you know I I
don't think that's real at all no I just
learned you something about your job
you can thank me later your tiny days
this way alright guys that's it thank
you thank you for tuning in we'll be
back next week with another show and uh
