hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Eric Kon Davis and
I'm Josh Herman in today's update we'll
take a look at how graev works in the
new flight model and see recent work on
playable female characters but first
let's take a look at some recent
Community Shenanigans our ever awesome
Spanish Community got together for their
recurring event series loen
Quinta this time around they engaged in
an epic vehicular battle in a huge
crater on dayon yeah those events are
always awesome yes they are
[Music]
the Los 50 crew losenta quentas thank
you always brings it so moving on to
development when creating an entirely
new flight model as we are currently
working on we cannot forget about gra
Lev no we can't let's take a look at how
gra Lev Vehicles will work when that new
flight model goes live here's David
Coulson and Andrew Nicholson with some
insights into the wild world of hover
bikes the old gra Lev system was heavily
dependent on the old flight model and
because the new flight model is a a lot
of work in the difference of
implementation um the old grav have
stopped working when we move toward the
new flat model the kind of fundamental
difference between a a gravl Thruster
and a regular Thruster is that it needs
a surface to work with so you need to be
close to the ground to get the traction
and the speed you need and so a onside
modifying and refactoring the
implementation of gravl we thought that
we would reconsider how we want it to
feel and how we wanted to actually you
know play and so that prompted um a
different implementation that we think
better achieves the design goals that
have been set out for this we wanted to
make it feel like you had uh risk again
previously you were getting too um
disconnected from the from the terrain
make the player have to make choices
based on the terrain that's up and
coming if the if it looks Rocky and
rough you want to avoid that and you can
sort of build tracks around that sort of
thing previously the bikes I think were
a little bit too easy they used to hover
over obstacles which we no longer do in
the new gravli model it's a little bit
more challenging um but there's also a
little bit more depth for you to learn
how to drive nicely and properly this is
just how we're how we're modeling this
to sort of make it feel a little bit
more interesting and a little bit more
uh fun to control with with a few a bit
more depth and so as you're hovering
this is ion model will inform the gra
plates how much thrust they need to
provide to hold the bike at its at its
certain height that it needs to be and
we have a lot more control over this now
we can sort of modify the height as
you're going so if you want to like fly
over rocks and stuff you can hold space
and it will like go over the tops of
rocks and things like that and then the
the jet ski model is
essentially simulated as though you were
semi submerged in water we have this
like fictitious water around the bike
and then as you're going through the
water um we'll model the amount of
friction that the the water is putting
on the side of the bike and then that
will inform the thrusters on the side of
the bike what thrust they need to be
giving at any point in time um so we
still have the thrusters effectively
driving the bike and the grab plates but
the way they're deciding how to thrust
is a lot different to how it used to be
um it's a little bit more complicated I
guess but it feels a lot nicer to drive
the bikes so I think it's absolutely
worth it I think overall the changes
we're making with the grav l system are
going to make for a enjoyable experience
the players going to feel more connected
to the bikes they're going to feel more
like um bikes overall anyway rather than
just floaty spacecrafts across the the
planet they want they're going to be
connected to the ground um and all the
potential terrain issues we can
introduce can result in some quite
exciting new race tracks going forward
in the future that looks really cool it
does it looks awesome you cannot wait
for the new flight model all right
moving on devs have been adjusting
animations for playable female
characters in order to differentiate
some movements from their counterparts
let's go to Brian Brewer for more info
about the process of retargeting
animations right now we are undergoing
the arduous task of retargeting all of
our male animations to our female
character typically in games males and
females share the same skeleton uh but
that has a few drawbacks like the
females tend to be masculine in our game
we decided we wanted to have a unique
skeleton for our female so that she is
unique and different from our male
character but this does however come
with a few um challenges that we have to
overcome for example her arms and her
legs have different proportions than her
male we have two ways of retargeting our
animations we have an automated approach
and we have a manual approach each has
its own advantages and disadvantages the
automated way is headed up by Rob Howen
our content tech department with
thousands of animations it's purely imp
practical to be able to do everything by
hand our manual method is reserved for
retargets where we we want a higher
Fidelity it's usually done by the
animator who did the mail animation
after it's been approved it's usually
for when we want to have in interaction
with an object like a spaceship uh and
it opens up a set of controls for us so
that we can better have contact points
uh and interactions with that object
after an animation is finished and
approved by our animation director we
import the female character into our
scene with the click of a button she is
being driven by the male character we
then take a little bit of time to turn
on on and off certain pull and reach
effectors over the course of the
animation we also keep in mind technical
requirements such as headcam for the
player View and the origin node which we
call the locator Locomotion when we are
happy with the result we bake down the
live retarget and Export to game for
testing the advantages of first
retargeting all the male animations to
the female uh is that we're able to get
everything in game and hand it off to
design right away they're no longer
having to wait for animation to supply
them with
content uh one of the disadvantages
though is that the female will still be
very masculine in some cases it doesn't
matter you'll never notice in other
cases we definitely need to replace
those animations with properly shot
female motion capture once we've
successfully replaced all the retargeted
animation with properly shot female
motion uh it will make our game feel
more alive uh it'll give um variety to
our universe and uh hopefully make
everything feel more immersive
so playable female characters MH what
are you the most excited about getting
that new playable character into the
game I think I'm just excited about
bringing the additional choice to the
players uh just kind of getting an extra
another gender into the into the verse
is going to be an exciting thing we've
been talking about it for a really long
time yeah I think it's just exciting to
finally be able to provide that to the
players so we won't be able to talk
about this much after it gets out but
what have been the challenges to get
this new height rig into the game and
everything that the world currently sure
Brian was kind of mentioning it shortly
but you know getting all of the the
skelet an entirely different skeleton of
the game is really complex and it
doesn't seem like it at first but it's a
completely different proportion so all
the weapons they're going to use all the
ships they're going to use all the
usables they're going to use everything
needs to be tweaked because it's a
different skeleton um so it's a lot of
work from a lot of people and it's it's
an exciting moment for us to finally be
able to deliver that yeah so we I mean
you know again we've talked about this
before we have female
NPCs why is it so hard now to do
playable and again you probably answer
this question many times the last many
years but what why you know we got
female NPCs what's the difference uh the
difference is that when you look at
something like a shopkeeper or a mission
Giver or something like that uh they
have a defined set of of animations a
Define set of data right whereas a
player has has a ton of stuff that you
can do you can shoot you can fly you can
you shop you can do all these different
things uh so it's really just the the
amount that is being processed is just
considerably more
exciting times exciting time to be alive
finally environment art continues to
work on Walla and Lia the two moons of
art
