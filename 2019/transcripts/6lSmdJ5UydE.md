hi everybody welcome to star citizen
live all about the UI I'm your host
Jared Huckaby and joining us on the show
this week UI people people from UI UI
kinda had a joke about UI and I just
lost it bad start bad start
Simon Zane welcome to the show hey
Jarrod are you good and now we haven't
had we haven't had a a UI feature on for
some time so let's take a let's take a
few moments at the beginning the show
introduce ourselves
tell us who you are and what you do for
star citizen will start with Zane Zane
who are you and what do you do for star
citizen so I'm the principal UI core
tech developer here
CAG what I work on is the core tech for
a UI so the kind of the fundamental
system that drives the display of user
interfaces in the game previously I was
the UI director so I wanted to kind of
get more neck deep into the code and the
engineering and and to advance the tech
much faster to kind of drive our
development so that's been working out
really good Simon here is is you can
well you can introduce yourself yeah so
so I I'm the UI director now
but that means mostly I spend my time
organizing things generally making sure
the UI on our various teams is kind of
heading the same direction and making
sure it's done on time that sort of
stuff when I get time which is not a lot
I do a bit of UI design so I've been
been looking into the the FPS hood the
visor can talk about later so it's kind
of fun yeah it's it's hard when you when
you get when you reach a directors level
it's a lot of times it's more big
picture stuff more oversight stuff I was
like I was actually excited when I heard
saying that you were jumping back into
the fray and really get
your your hands dirty with the UI stuff
again UI is a I'm often quoted as saying
UI is a department that affects every
single aspect of star citizen like I
don't think there's an aspect of start
something that doesn't require some
assistance or implementation from UI so
it's a it's a super important department
soon super important discipline for game
design and I'm really excited that
you're here and that you're both here
and we can answer some questions we can
talk about this so thank you for taking
the time out of your week now this is a
Friday at the end of your week so thank
you for being here and let's just get
right into the questions here we take
questions from a number of sources on
star citizen life in case this is your
first show you can submit your questions
in either the twitch chat or in spectrum
chat by posting your question with the
word question in capital letters
surrounded by brackets that'll help our
team you'll pull it out from the rest of
the conversation we also put up a thread
earlier this week and started collecting
questions throughout the week for folks
who maybe couldn't be here with us live
or folks we just wanted to vote up which
questions they wanted to see answered
most so we ran so as always we're going
to start with the what we call the
pregame questions ones that came in
throughout the week on spectrum that
were voted up we're out the bat what can
you tell us about plans to let users
customize their various HUD elements we
have been hearing this for a long time
here things like prioritizing features
and a resizing elements or changing the
color stuff like that where our thoughts
on this so I guess so
I can start this one over in the deep
end right off the bat so it's an
interesting question really I suppose
the thing that we would ask first is why
do people want to customize things I get
the impression in some cases just
because the current UI is which needs a
little bit of updating is not quite
working for people so I think the first
step for us would be to find out those
issues people don't want well the way
it's set up that people don't like at
the moment and that's the first thing
for us to address so relating to that
we're doing a lot of rework on the the
hood and the MFDs and the FPS visor
moment so a lot of those kind of
questions it's great to it's great to
bring up the reasoning now and then we
can start to incorporate that into into
these things as we move forward yeah I
know a lot of the lot of discussion
about this for a while has been either
addressing issues like the glare though
they want to change the color or
something because whatever they're
flying against matches the color and
it's gonna be difficult to read
sometimes people just like different
colors like you know people just prefer
it a different a different orientation
or sometimes it's an actual visual
acuity thing like some people just have
difficulty seeing you know certain
colors on the spectrum and if you're if
you happen to be you know we're if you
have to have that weakness right there
where the UI is I can be difficult to
read so I know folks have been asking
for the ability to adjust certain
elements that UI for some time so yeah
sure but I know that's something we're
definitely considering something we
we've talked about for a while and but
like you said it's really important to
get the building blocks and to make it
as functional as possible before we
start introducing customizable elements
if we ever do well I mean the thing with
building blocks and whoa Billy basically
building boxes what it's like our
internal term for the UI tech so the
tool that we use to develop you is a new
the new one not the old one so like a
lot of it is allowing for like flexible
layouts or being able to easily reflow
elements so they can rearrange
themselves very easily relative to each
other and it opens up so much more
because we can make the UI so much more
dynamic and responsive and flexible
whereas before it's just kind of you
know if we were to think about like
maybe layout customization or you know
if we had like a grid system something
he can kind of plug into and rearrange
on then it makes it so much easier than
before because everything before was
just hardwired it was very static in
nature but you know if we have a fully
data-driven and flexible system you know
it kind of opens that up now that we can
we can start asking like what makes
sense for customization like previously
is just like
yeah we could we could do colors but
like it'd be very complicated to do you
know like resizing and things like that
when you have static a lot you know very
very statically authored UI so
implementation wise it's it's like much
easier now so it's just basically like
what are the kind of fundamental issues
like you know we mentioned things about
like you know the bright like you know
how readable things are against you know
bright backgrounds and you know you want
to change colors but you know well kind
of a lute to this later on I think but
you know there might be a better
solution for that that's that's you know
not goes beyond you I yeah yeah you hit
on a point that Simon made that I think
is worth reiterating right now it's
while we're in development you know as
we are we want to focus our work on
making the best default standard UI
possible and that can only be done if
everybody's using the same thing so that
we can see all the feedback so that we
see all the you know how it's working if
you were to introduce customization to
early in the process then it skewers the
feedback because we don't know what this
person is using versus what this person
is using versus what this person is
using so it's while you're developing
it's really important everybody has the
same thing so that we can get proper
feedback and we can iterate the way that
you need to to make the best default
standard UI we can yep that's that's
very well put and definitely yeah wait
so but if anyone does have suggestions
like we really need to have this thing
color changeable because of whatever
reasons then do that as knowing we will
will read the comments and we'll take
that into account when we get to it I
mean I assume we'll have like easily
selectable colorblind options as well
well yeah you know just change the color
yeah things like we can't do all the
things all I wanted son fortunately
that's true
all right so next question says
currently UI elements like icons of
station turrets or mission points can be
very invasive
sometimes filling the screen I've seen
this I've come out of quantum jump and
just my entire screen is littered with
every single turn
and everything that's around what can be
done to make this more user friendly or
diegetic so do I take this one or shall
I
so this is one thing that I'm really
interested in is looking at I'm not sure
how soon we're going to get to it but
what we would like to have is some kind
of intelligent system so there's
obviously loads of stuff that we could
show all over the screen potentially so
points of interest mission objective
markers chips and so on what we need to
have is a kind of an intelligent system
that works on how far away things are
and also a priority and of a priority
that the design is set and then somehow
works out which of those things to show
and how many of them to show so it kind
of picks and chooses from this massive
selection and shows you the most
important things from those so that's
that would be the starting point to
addressing this I think ok next question
this is kind of a big picture one here
as the universe becomes more complex
more in different kinds of entities are
vying for space on the HUD notifications
Pio eyes
QT destinations ship's mission markers
how do you manage all this visual
information and can anything be done to
give playtoy well the second part is can
we give players the ability to customize
so so what can be done to manage all
this information there the answered the
last board yeah so going off of kind of
riffing off the stuff that I talked
about the UI tag before when we have
easily flexible layouts and things like
that we can start thinking about making
things much more I'm smart about when
they display and contextual about when
they display so for instance you know
you have this big no target you know
this is the example that I think Chris
gave previously but you had like there's
no target big box that's on the screen
all the time but you know if you don't
have target know why not just you know
not have that and when we when we apply
that to you know maybe like the other
feeds or you know the HUD it's like
things can that you don't need can you
know disappear out of view and reappear
when they're needed so things can be
much smarter about when they appear
things can be a lot more contextual
rather than just always being there all
the time so I think one thing relating
to this is I think as the games been
built up over the years there's been a
lot of things kind of added on top kind
of little features out of here and there
so now you want to take this step back
and look at all the other stuff that we
want to show and we're going to try and
look at the best ways to arrange those
on the screen as well so maybe we for
example keep the chat in the bottom left
have the objectives in the top right
that kind of thing so so try and work
out a layout for the screen that works
and where things don't overlap and don't
clutter each other so that's that's
definitely something we're looking into
here the chat is like the most obvious
example because you have this constant
overlap with the ship FFT and that's
actually because it's on two different
contexts and they don't know about each
other's sizes so it's you know if when
we actually revamp the whole thing we
rethink like we're creating like we're
looking at the MFDs right now and we're
creating like this whole new system
that's this is just like much more
systemic and you know there's a grid
system that where everything kind of
fits in to each other and you know you
can create different sizes of widgets so
like the chat should you know you know
you can have that like reflow with
something depending on maybe how much
you've customized your visor rather than
just being statically placed all the
time so it ties all of this ties into
the functionality and the capability you
would have in the new system yes and
something we we're definitely aware of
the the overlaps no like kind of thing
and we definitely want to fix it yeah
yeah it's a heck of a challenge and
we'll get into it later a bit but having
the the diegetic displays on the MFDs
and then having the helmet displace you
know you get into a ship you have it
having both and building a system that
can switch things out and realize okay
when you've got this on the end if you
don't need it on them on the helmet and
vice versa and stuff yeah it's an
interesting challenge ahead of you guys
yeah I mean there's lips we're lucky you
have the you know you have the helmet
you I present even though you've got
like a you know a sea of screens so once
we can make that you know enable the
ability
functionality to actually cast things
your visor than you know the things that
even you know automatically just become
much cleaner
we want that age what we want to do that
to pull you know to take things and
terror specific parts of the UI out and
put it on your visor because they be
it's more useful and you want that more
kind of immediately in your view but
it's building up that function I was
getting kind of the systemic stuff and
kind of a foundation define first for
the MFDs how things display when should
they display you know what goes where
and and then building that into the
overall design so that's something like
we're spending a lot of time now working
on as the tech is being developed
alongside that in parallel yeah one of
the things we're doing because I guess
the people at home don't really see it
very much but we're kind of building the
tools to help us as developers make
really good UI and then once that's done
then we start putting the good UI in the
game so everyone else can see it and use
it and give us feedback in that kind of
thing well we're gonna work on the
people at home seeing that stuff that's
next quarter of ISC we're gonna get
we're in exam on maybe something else
and get a couple more UI segments in
there so people can better see and
understand the work that your team has
been doing from the live chat got a
question for you
message spam that we're receiving the
message spam that keeps popping up on
the UI is that a bug or a design feature
well I think it's it's kind of a legacy
thing from having so many features being
out to the game and they're all kind of
competing for attention and the way the
current UI is it's not really well have
its scale so this is one of the things
we're we're planning on investigating
the the visor to display generally and
part of that investigation will be what
do we do to this messaging messaging
system to make it work for people so we
can do things like for example we can
give the messages priority so if
something really important comes up that
kind of overrides the other stuff that's
there we could give things timers so
they stay on for a set time and
potentially just not show more than a
sir
number of messages in the same amount of
time so there's plenty of little tools
we can we can apply to that to make it
work better yeah I think I think it's
mainly just that we had that
notification which in the center there
and as more features got added on over
time especially the mission stuff the
new all the new mission stuff that kind
of came in I kind of latched on to that
and you know now it's spamming like 100
missions so I mean before is just yeah
it had a few notifications but we need
to kind of take that in account and have
a system that's much smarter about what
notifications should display there
versus you know maybe the missions
probably would be better served by you
know just like a pulsing icon with a
number on it
you know indicating the number of new
missions that you haven't read yet yep
you know things like you you know when
you get a like a new email and your
inbox says like one or this tears three
black impulse on each new mission that
comes in rather than just like boom all
you know this this new mission is now
available it's like taking up and
present your screen ya know something
that's much smarter more elegant yeah
another thing we're considering is kind
of splitting it out a little bit so
you've got your you kind of messages in
one place and then we're probably quite
it's quite like we'd have a sort of
mission objective area that shows you
your current mission related stuff and
we might as well have it have a separate
thing for the kind of keyboard keyboard
shortcuts and that sort of thing you
know there's little hints that pop up so
kind of move those things to different
parts of the screen so they're not kind
of always competing for the same space
speaking of competing for the same space
we have a question from the live chat
here that speaks to those of us who have
non-standard resolution monitors what
are we doing to support non 1080p
resolutions star citizens many star
systems are tend to be on the cutting
edge of technology and have these 16 the
21 by 9 monitors or 32 by 9 monitors if
you're my dad what are we doing to to
help the UI play better on that you know
every time I patch comes out sometimes
the star map or the ship ID doesn't
exactly work real well with the wider
your screen resolutions
that's a good one fishing oh yeah it's
one thing is because again as I
mentioned before is like all of our UI
is authored in a very static manner so
we you know we would be able to in our
stuff that we have our flexible way out
you know we're developing because we
have flexible layouts those can you know
we can have that resize potentially
depending on your your your aspect ratio
it monitor so you know everything
remains visible on screen but the
challenge also is that things are in in
world as well so you know wall may be
the mobi glass might be in world we
could also you know take what is your
current screen resolution and be able to
scale that UI even though it is diegetic
and it is in the world
also maybe block a combination of that
and feel the view changes although
that's something we're still kind of
looking into in terms of getting that
all to work yeah it's hard when you put
if prioritization is I mean cannot be it
cannot be understated how important it
is to prioritize the things that we work
on does like we said before you can't
work on all the things all at once
and those widescreen monitors while
there's certainly cool so like that they
are generally edge cases in the overall
population of star citizen so oftentimes
we have to prioritize the things that
affect the most number of users first
before we start going to the the edge
cases but it I was gonna say that's
something that effects that the dev
teams here as well because everybody's
working on these cool new features so
every every quarter or every few weeks
even we get people saying oh we've got
this cool thing can you do the UI for it
and we have to we have such a big list
to choose from we have to pick and
choose the the most important ones are
them kind of leave the rest a little bit
later yeah I swear half of the game
development is just prioritization it's
probably a saying somewhere that they
don't know about all right what's going
on let's see are there any plans to add
keyboard integration in and navigating
the various interfaces we encounter in
addition to just the mouse like even
just you know hitting the arrow keys on
the keyboard to go up and down in a UI
thing something like that yeah so we
want to be old we want to design
our UI to be like it's it's much more
keyboard friendly so you know right now
you can only use the mouse and let's
just kind of rubbish I think because
having that keyboard access like whether
it's an MSD or even even when you're
you're like in a shopping console having
the keyboard you know able to navigate
with that makes things a lot easier
because you know even even if you have a
mouse and you're and you know you're
interacting with it you have kind of
those two controls at the same time and
it's it's it can be much faster to go
through different menus with the
keyboard navigation but it also you know
it allows us to kind of simplify a lot
of stuff as well
yeah I think we'd really like to be able
to have any well people should be able
to play the game with a variety of
controllers so they can use the keyboard
and mouse just the keyboard or joystick
joystick or gamepad as well so I think
of you in a way like Damon saying if
your design for the most difficult thing
which is potentially the gamepad if you
make a UI design that works for that
you're generally doing a kind of simple
and elegant design anyway so it's quite
often a good way to approach things
generally and as we go through and
redesign these various bits of the
screens so for example we're doing the
we're starting to look at the MFDs at
the moment we've got this sort of
high-level design at the moment and as
those start to get implemented that's
probably one of the first areas where we
start to have this more kind of uniform
control method that caters for everybody
most people yeah like like for example
with here you know you're you're you're
managing you know the individual items
and an MSD but like there can be maybe
three or four different actions that are
you know that you can or take upon that
when you're when you're when you have it
selected you can be much quicker about
doing that with with like shortcuts
rather than kind of hunting for the
button with your mouse
but of course anytime you're dealing
with keyboard shortcuts you're you're
fighting for real estate at that point
with other features everybody's ever
looked at I haven't been a sexual about
what keys are available in what modes so
if you're interacting with on FB you
know potentially you might not need some
stuff
that's normally otherwise so I in a
previous show this was a while ago
we mentioned that we're moving away from
the flash and Scaleform stuff for
forehead UI in favor of a homegrown
solution what can you tell us about that
what progress have we made where we at
so kind of already touched on a little
bit on the previous questions but yeah
we used flash and we're still using it
now but we're trying to get away from it
so we're kind of in this phase where
we're transitioning away from using
flash this kind of things this program
where we're baking our assets and into a
much more or fully data-driven system so
and previously in flash
you kind of set things up it's very
static you don't see what it looks like
in game until you actually export it and
reload the editor so also the actual
interface with the game code is much
more simplified so before we actually
had to write classes for each individual
feel that you wanted to modify and you
had to then create a class to manage
that field from on the flash side so you
kind of in a lot of cases we got had
like artists filling with code which is
just not ideal it's just rubbish so in
our new system we have like the standard
API where any game program in any team
could actually expose some variables
what we call bindings variables so the
example is like an ammo counter on a
weapon you know game program just kind
of register a variable ammo count and
then in our UI tech we can actually
create a node and then specify the name
of that variable or select from it from
the list of available variables and then
just plug it straight into a text field
it's that easy and we see it why we
update we updated live in the game in
fact we can actually be another editor
and you know be in-game you could be
like a character and have health and
everything and work on a UI so it's
quite cool it's it's it's too much
it's it's taking so it's it's still
using scale form as a renderer so we
boil we we kind of cut out the the
process of actually authoring the UI in
flash and the socks are our own tools
and our own data-driven system but we
still were still using scale form to to
draw the B vectors so it's we boil it
down to just the renderer so you know
things like when we're when we're
drawing borders we're drawing
backgrounds we're drawing like curved
corners and things like that and we're
rendering text that's all this really
does and everything else on top of that
is our own code and our own system so at
some point we will take that render and
we will build our own so it's almost
like an abstraction layer between our
own tools and our own development and
the renderer and then at some point we
switch that out for just be completely
rid of it since I started the company
one thing that's really we're finding as
well is because we kind of owned this
tech and we've got a team working on it
we can say I suppose just going back to
flash flash was originally designed as
an animation system for web stuff so if
you wanted to make a make a bar on that
you can do it it takes a little time but
if someone goes yeah don't like that
kind of bar key turn it into a dial
that's gonna take loads of extra work
whereas with the building block stuff we
can just swap those over and also if so
for example if the dial thing didn't
exist yet we can just go to the programs
and say we could really do with the dial
widget
once that's made then we can reuse that
wherever we want to within the rest of
the UI so because there's a lot of
control this developers yeah and also
because it's fully data-driven
everything in the UI is programmatically
drawn and driven from data
so you know we don't we don't have to
really worry as much about other artists
stomping over each other's work because
you can merge it in right right that's
one change can be merged another change
without having to fiddle with two in
resolve conflicts over two binary files
that's change and hunting for okay
whatcha library symbol was change and
it's just it's so much much much easier
and so many different ways that maybe
you know I can't list all of them right
now all right let's uh let's get into
some of the more in-game stuff the the
experience that people are having with
with the UI got a section here for
personal UI and helmet stuff what are
your thoughts on being able to nope
where'd he did that one we covered that
one already has there been any
discussion about adding a compass ribbon
giving us cardinal directions on planets
or moons so well I suppose that's
another of those is what's the reason
for wanting it so it's yes but there are
other ways to solve that potentially so
it doesn't necessarily have to be a
compass widget one thing we're looking
into you probably saw it on one of the
earlier videos you know and we showed
the area maps this interior map I think
we had it on there we had a little
mock-up of a personal radar that kind of
shows you like a mini map by essentially
something like that could show you you
direction for example so having a little
compass is not necessarily the only
solution but if when as we revise the
head the visor stuff which were we're
starting at the moment then if it seems
like that's a compass for example is
really necessary then we'd certainly
consider that an investigator yeah it's
probably not out of the questions just
you know you also have to take into
account that oops planets are
procedurally generated and you kind of
have to have a way to define what's
north west east south exactly how to
create polls so we have to create polls
for the planet you know simulate
magnetic poles is a word and then you
know be able to position you yeah and
you can solve some of the navigate
and problems with things like if we have
some kind of sat-nav like system in
there which I know there were some
questions about in the in the chat
something like that could also solve the
problem in a different way
so this yeah it the Cummins ribbon is
more than just a UI question because
again you can't just programming you I
think and have a work that there's
there's system design that has to go
into it in order to build a build a
relationship on that planet that lets
you lock to it and then of course they'd
have to be different ones for every
single planet moon and it would have to
know when you're transferring from one
to another so you don't want to be on
yellow and have it be pointing you
towards north fun Hurston yeah that's a
lot of these educators make UI
complicated sometimes we think we've got
something really easy to do and then you
know there's these five things that we
hadn't thought about there are a lot of
things that sometimes seem like they're
a UI issue and it's not it can be it can
be a system design issue then it's its
UI in its basic in the most basic sense
exposes information that's that's built
by other system designers and game
designers and stuff so if that system
hasn't been developed there's no way for
the UI team to expose it yeah
is it possible to have a button to hide
the HUD or a button to reactivate it
when needed these are probably from
screenshot folks who just want to you
know clear everything from the screen
and get this clean image they can we get
a lot of developers asking us that how
do you hide the HUD
what's ivar do I need to invoke to hide
it right so especially for you know the
directors cam and and being able to
record stuff that's yes we'll definitely
be improving that system as we you know
overhaul our UI so we'll take that and
count the same thing that we do there
will also help us developers also you
know hide HUD for screenshots we take
internally so like we can specify
certain sections of the UI like whether
that's the just the ship HUD but maybe
not the visor right or I want to hide
all UI but I don't want to hide the UI
what that's just in
environment that helps kind of bring it
to life like background fluff screens so
things like that we need to have like
differentiated C VARs so we can kind of
leverage that when we're building the
system to maybe expose something to the
players as well to kind of hide the UI
like when you're trying to record court
stuff and you don't want all these
markers on your screen that's just that
this is drawing the scene yeah there's
one thing that relates today this which
is for the general UI especially for the
visor for the FPS so if we want to have
a system where it only shows you the UI
that's relevant at the time so for
example if you put your weapon away you
don't really need to see the weapon
display on the corner of the screen or
potentially you wouldn't show the health
until you actually get injured that kind
of thing so it that should as well help
with this kind of perception of so
cluttered screen there cluttered screen
in a way so if we only show things when
they're really needed then that's gonna
also feel a bit nicer just for the
day-to-day players as well yeah that
ties into that kind of contextual could
actually driven stuff that was talked
about before is there any are there
plans to allow a chat UI to be viewed
when we're not wearing a helmet
I think we've mentioned the possibility
of a special like contact lens or
something I just see it to see our chat
when we're when we're in you know player
clothes down on area 18 or something yes
is the answer so yeah it's a it's a
multiplayer game so you need to be able
to see what your teammates are doing and
talking to you about and so on so we
definitely do have plans to have that
visible pretty much all the time so if
you if you got a helmet you just got
your lens which is the state without the
helmet in the ship third-person view as
well potentially so yes we would like to
have that in sometime soon actually
actually actually touched on this a
while back the next question is about
that interior map that we showed a while
back and you know the little like the
mini map or the 3d map have we happened
what progress have we made was that at
this question is asking you really want
it please it literally says I don't have
a question I'm gonna read actually a
couple years ago we were shown interior
maps in the player heads years
I don't think was ears but I don't have
a question I really just want it please
it's what the question says I think
that's one you can answer yeah yeah I
know I really want it to I mean I was
one of the first things that we we
started working on when I when I started
started here and it's going to be a
really cool addition so we kind of got a
development version that's halfway there
I suppose at the moment but we made a
decision fairly recently that what we
were going to do is focus on getting the
shepherds and the the player the FPS
hood sorted out first so as they're kind
of more integral to the overall gameplay
you want to get them right get them
playing well and then we're going to go
back to the area map stuff later on
hopefully really soon it depends a bit
on what else comes up but yeah we'd love
to get that up and running and also
that's going to tie into this well
you'll have the full screen version
where you can look around the whole area
and also this little mini map that you
get on your visor as well so it's going
to be useful to players especially as
they're exploring interiors you said
ship head let's move into the ship had
questions hi ship hug right off the bat
why does quantum calibration mode
scanning mode mining mode in any other
sub UI mode take away or hide crucial
flight information such as speed
altitude attitude and any other useful
information needed for basic flight so
they're basically developed in like in
under the hood as different contexts the
in our overhaul of the design we're
factoring that all that flight
information so it's it's all available
to you regardless of whether you're kind
of in scanning or in mining mode or
whatever it is because it is still
relevant you can still fly so therefore
you should still retain all your flight
information that you need
so in those modes we're looking at
potentially contextually changing out
the screens of cells so rather than just
having the HUD change for these
different modes we can leverage the
screens in some capacity you know
potentially changing some of the
elements shifting elements around so
that certain information that's relevant
to that mode
displayed rather than just kind of
taking up your entire Hut as well so
something that has happened over the
course of development but not in an
intention to take away crucial flight
information when you're trying to spool
up your quand right yes that's right I
mean sometimes with these things you
don't realize that it's going to cause
issues until you try it and that's just
one of those cases integrations are a
family most bugs come from you
know everything works fine in your own
little you know you know your branch and
then it's integrating it in with
everything else we're we're bugs and all
the users come into play yeah all the
outside factors they didn't quite think
of start to you uh yeah yeah there's a
thing your team is working on here and
then there's a thing somebody else is
working on here and in their own little
universes they work great and then it's
when you integrate them into into game
dev and you know that's where all the
collisions and and stuff happens so yeah
that's how bugs are made that's the
story of the birds and the bugs they
remind kind of off today it's weird all
right can you update us on plans for the
landing UI improvements needed for the
implementation of hover mode people it's
hard to land and hover mode basically
what they're saying so when we we
actually a while back we changed the the
method that we actually use to render
the UI from what was called 3d I to
render to texture so it's actually
rendered as part of the screens and it
actually takes you know all the kind of
post effects and everything so the
original landing UI that had that
replaced the radar what it built on was
was the 3d eye tech and that didn't what
just wasn't compatible with the render
texture so this is kind of how we lost
is so we're looking at bringing that
back in some capacity but maybe with
just as a better design we were just
focusing mainly on the structure and the
layout of the MFDs right now kind of
defining as I said like you know what
contexts are available what things
should be displayed where when how but
yeah there's definitely something that
we need and as part of that also
potentially having some kind of like
guide system as well so in having some
AR element that is displayed in
conjunction with that widget we touched
on this a little bit before when we
talked about the customization thing and
how we want to you know build our own
default stuff so first so one of the big
problems here let's get into it when you
how do we intend to improve the
legibility of UI elements that tend to
sit over the environment an environment
that can sometimes be very glaring I
mean everybody's played star citizen has
experienced this you if you point your
ship anywhere remotely near the star at
the center of the Crusader system all of
your UI elements washed out what are we
intending to do about that so there's
there's a few kind of more in world
solutions that we're looking at I mean
the obviously obvious thing you can do
is you know potentially add a drop
shadow of the UI or just make it black
or something but that just kind of
destroys the aesthetic of it of what
we're trying to go for so one thing that
we're looking at is and we started this
a bit with the Claudio side although
it's not completely there yet is having
some system where it's contextually most
dynamically taking the brightness in the
environment and adjusting the brightness
of the UI in response to that in
addition you know to make things look
and feel much more in world we want to
kind of have the huts displayed on
actual geometry that you can that you
can see so it kind of grounds it in the
world much better but it's part of that
we can kind of leverage that to may be
dynamically tint that in addition to
brightening the the UI based upon
environmental conditions so it's a much
more or thinking that has like a much
more like in world and it uses the you
it leverages the in-game Ella
it's in a way that's kind of it's it's
more convincing than just kind of making
it like black or something is there is
there something we can do beyond just
frightening well so I can come like like
just taking the HUD for instance it's
like a combination of tinting that that
physical glass plane a little bit but
also brightening the UI that's honest so
it's almost like you know when you have
your phone on automatic brightness you
go out in the sunlight right you know it
can automatically adjust to to you know
make it more readable because right now
if you notice it's actually an issue
with the eye adaptation where if you go
down onto the planet the UI even on
yours you see it on your screens as well
it's actually compared to when you're in
space it's very dim in in the in in
sunlight so it's about kind of taking
those environmental conditions and then
using that to potentially brighten write
stuff up but it's something that we're
looking into and and and kind of you
know we talked a little bit about with
our graphics team so that as well as
also potentially having some kind of
effect in the in the UI tech in the UI
rendering tech to like like things like
like the health widget for instance like
maybe maybe maybe it's not just the
stuff in your visor having like a
backdrop that's that's not just a black
square but it's it's a little more
elegant it's like you know a like a
blurred frosted glass effect that helps
with readability but and also not just
against bright backgrounds but also you
know busy backgrounds you just have a
lot of you know dark it's like a fence
or something you know you kind of get
that it gets lost
yeah kind of a camouflage effect yeah
visual noise kind of disguises the UI on
top they are being out speed out what
would should it should help with them a
lot of the suggestions you know the
community offers no shortage of
suggestions a lot of suggestions that
come from the community often focused
around adding a small black stroke
around letters or putting a drop shadow
behind text or stuff
that stuff and not something we can
consider or definitely some I mean we
can definitely consider things along
those lines
it depends how subtle you are about is
well if you have a really obvious doubt
line a blur or drop shadow like like
Zane said that's not necessarily going
to fit with this of sci-fi look that
we're going for there may be ways to to
do something very subtly so it's for you
I wouldn't say it's like a question or
anything but like you know it's not not
just overbearing too strong that it just
looks you know cartoony yeah sure yeah
right you don't want it to look like a
cartoon yeah so we want to just explore
the ideas that I've described before and
then we'll just see where we're at with
that yeah but ultimately we want to we
want the UI to be readable yeah how's
this as much as people want the who I
didn't readable so yeah one of those
things like like a lot of the UI where
we basically want to try it try out a
few different options so we concept
different ideas like we could do this
way or this way and then and step back
and look and decide which is going to
solve it the best way and then then pick
pick that and go and put it in
currently the MFDs on ships have a
default configuration that must be
changed each time the pilot gets back
into the pilot's seat I know are their
intentions to add the ability to save
custom MFD configuration presets for
individual players preferences oh yeah I
mean that's gotta persist at some point
it's just it the other issue is now is
just it doesn't persist right so the in
our while stay in our new UI tech the UI
will be with what we call stainless so
it won't store anything it won't store
any state about itself it takes
everything from like an entity or what's
on on the server so basically when we go
to develop our the the MSD or
implemented the new design that we're
working on
by that point hopefully we'll we'll be
able to persist like you know as you you
know enter and exit the sea you'll see
the same screens that you were on before
even if you've tabbed over you shifted
things around so it's you know it's
definitely something we wanna yeah
another thing relate to that we want to
when we do this pass on the MFDs we want
to make sure that the we're showing the
most important important information by
default as well so I'm sure people will
be able to change things and so on but
it would mean that there be less need
for the the kind of the first time
player for example to swap things around
hopefully it'll be set up in a way this
that's good for the general players
potentially presets as well that you can
they can quickly activate you know you
may you may want something that's a
configuration a screen configuration you
know when we go to kind of enable the
devisor configuration as well having
preset presets associated with those
that you can quickly access is something
we can look at as well yeah plenty of
things to consider yeah yeah the the the
ship the ship MFDs put it diplomatically
can be a bit cumbersome having to drill
down from one menu to the next menu to
the next many of the next one or to
finally get to the thing that you're
you're looking for and in a combat
situation that that those seconds that
can be deadly I know we're in the
process of working out and a complete
refactor of the ship FF DS right that is
correct about that so how do we stop
yeah where do we start I mean already
already kind of touched on a little bit
a little bit but I mean yeah so I mean
right now and I guess the most obvious
thing is that like they're they're just
small and they're scale down there now
readable and I mean we used to have
what's called what we call these support
screens where we kind of have the this
screen that had minimal information on
it but its font size was made in a way
that was legible so we're kind of
looking at this system we're in by
default you have a kind of a potentially
a different set up on your screens a set
up I mean a more minimized display so
it's it's like showing you
really only what you need to know but in
a I know where all the font sizes are
very legible so we take it's really just
about how much pixels the screen is
taken up on your screen on your monitor
when you're kind of in the default view
but when you're focusing on a screen
what I can do is it can contextually
change to something that's more in depth
that we want on the end of these so
whether you're going you're focusing in
on MFD or you're in flight mode that
will contextually change to present you
with always readable information yeah so
so when you back when you're sitting
back in your in your seat the way that
these will change and it'll be only the
most necessary information big legible
and then when you zoom in and look into
it it'll sense that and it'll change and
reformulate and show you more
information
yeah actually the cool thing about the
UI tech helping develop is that we're
kind of taking keys from the area of
like web development because you know
that's my background too so I know a lot
about of it but you know you have this
thing called responsive design so you
can have rule set up where beyond a
certain point like if there's a box in
our UI that goes beyond a certain point
then you know you shrinks down beyond a
certain point that you can actually have
different styles or visual descriptions
applied to that and conditionally
depending on maybe how how much it's
sized so we're kind of leveraging that
to help with the reformulation of the UI
on screens as well as you know when we
were laying things out and when we
potentially opened up customization that
can be really helpful as like a tool to
help us manage and maintain the UI
because we even on like different sized
screens in the game you
69 you have four threes you have one
ones currently we have to maintain three
different binary files for those and if
you want to make a change in one well
you have to go into each binary file and
make that same change but if we can just
maintain one UI and then just have these
different style rules applied to it then
it makes it much easier to maintain so
you just change one thing and a change
changes for every different manufacturer
every different kind of configuration
and it all works so yeah it's a bit of a
tangent might be interesting is the
actual process that we're going through
with those we've got mark colorin who's
he's quite famous for UI phones out
there he's looking through the he's
looking through the designs we've
already got like what's in the game now
and also working very closely with the
vehicles team talking to them what do
you want to show on these screens and
kind of trying to find out generally
what's in all the MFDs and then going
and redesign each screen to kind of get
the best out of it so we're at that
stage now and then when as Zane's team
progresses the UI tech eventually will
get to a point where that the screens
are redesigned the techs ready and then
we'll start to put those in the game I
was just googling my car around now
cargo UI just I'm a car UI right now
players have to go back to chaos just to
see the inventory of what they're
carrying on their ships do we have any
plans for implementing some kind of
shipboard cargo UI so that we can see
what we're carrying without having to
get to a destination first
yeah they definitely should yep this is
something something that we will look at
yes so we know that's needed in yeah
where it comes taking the timeline I'm
not sure but at some point yeah that
wasn't on the list that was just when I
put in there myself are there any plans
to allow us to prioritize the use of
missiles or torpedoes through MFDs
nothing that's another
another thing that we're we're going to
look at as well so I believe we have
that previously I think it broke yeah I
think John John crew coming here this
one I think the way the way is in the
moment the UI actually supports that but
there's a bit of refactoring these doing
in the background to get the the weapons
set up to match up so yeah there's
something we do want to do and it will
be there in the future at some point
yeah and and a better design for it
rather than just clicking up yeah are
there any plans to allow us to see
points of interest in other UI modes
right now we only see them in I think
the quantum drive mode yeah so I think
this is definitely something I'd be
interested in it's one of those things
it kind of relates back to that thing
we're talking about before with managing
how much information you show so if we
get it to a point where we can I suppose
cut down the amount of icons and things
to a sensible level then we can consider
whether it's worth putting those in
other views as well so it's definitely
something that we should look at whether
which views it goes into and how much
and if it even goes into certain ones I
don't know at this stage but that's one
of those things where you have to get a
system in try it and then then decide
where is the best places to it's very
much iterative yeah
what about an EPA marker you know when
we go to quantum travel we see the
distance ticking down but based on the
capabilities of our ship and the type of
quantum drive we have something that
tells us how long it's going to take so
I know if I can get up and go to the
bathroom or not yep I think that's a
good idea I think we were looking at
that question earlier in saying hey what
do you think about this and then
generally friends like yeah we should do
that
so yeah that's definitely something we
look to you to adding at at some point
yeah yeah we have an ETA for when your
oxygen runs out so I don't see a reason
why we would have fought in the in the
current file system they're floating
menus is that closer is that what are
our thoughts on the intern thought that
look what I'm trying to reword the
question of it it get kind of
but this person is asking about if inner
thought if we're happy with where inner
thought is right now or if we're if
we've got plans to continue to iterate
on it well I know there's a lot of cases
where era thought kind of appears where
ideally it shouldn't so like things over
screens like when you're I guess the
obvious example is when you're in an
airlock you'll get a you get an inner
thought saying press the screen whereas
why not just just you know we should
just have the press to screen and that's
something our UI tech allows for now so
we can actually have like buttons in the
UI so when you're specifying maybe like
what floor you want to go up to like an
an elevator or something that can be
buttons that you click on in actual UI
rather than you know having this inner
thought option that's kind of doesn't
really make sense in the world so before
we look at the visuals a bit as well yes
it's okay it's usable and so on but I'm
sure we can make it look a bit prettier
we do have some other interaction stuff
going on at the moment that we're we're
kind of figuring out which could be
quite cool that relates to that but
that's probably something you want to we
want to save to a little bit later till
there's more to show thank you
a long time ago or the live chat here we
talked about the potential of
manufacturer-specific
you eyes like you get into an anvil in
the UI is anvil you get into an Aegis
and ship in the UI is a just are we
still is that still on the planets I
still am about that don't look
yes and it's much more possible now with
the UI tech because we have the style
sheet system so you know as I was just
kind of describing before everything had
to be baked into binary assets so if we
wanted to have different manufacturers
styles this would require one file form
envel one file for RSI one file origin
oh we want to change you know this thing
and that thing and you know what you
know let's add this feature in and we
got to display it so you know that's
that's going into all these different
binary files adding that UI adding the
code
but with salaries we just have one kind
of white box you line and we just the
visual description is defined and
applies to that so you know we actually
have this example now and our kind of
rough initial implementation in the UI
tech where we actually select from a
drop-down first have like RSI and that
that applies a set of rules like oh well
you know the the corners are maybe ten
pixel chamfer and the font color is this
and so forth and so on but then we
switch to origin and then and
everything's kind of a more elegant you
know it's it's all the style has changed
just on just your drop-down because it's
not it's data-driven so it's not like
it's baked in as well is it once the
system is in place it gives us more
opportunity to hand it over to the
graphic designers so you've got a guy
who comes with a really cool retro
design for one of the ships for example
it's a lot easier for us to kind of drop
that into the game and have it working
out so it's less dependence on someone
going into flash and knowing how to code
in flash and then use it's kind of
slightly outdated interface so it should
really help when we get to get to that
stage yeah there's a lot of properties
now that you can that you can modify
with these style rules so a lot of
possibilities and a lot of ways to
differentiate between manufacturers but
also it's not just just styling as well
it's also you know when we get to it
it's also kind of the way you lay things
out as well so things like ships like
origin mask will you know have more
holographic UI and in our it's part of
our tech and actually we're starting to
I think we're investigating the initial
engineering requirement for this but
making it so you can have 3d UI as well
so being able to in the tech and the
tools to for a developer to build a UI
or they can manipulate different planes
and z-axis so make a 3d UI and have it
be and it looked really holographic so
having that kind of style for the more
kind of what you say technically
advanced ships versus more
once I think we have just the retro one
just fitted in every every ship right
now that'll eventually be something we
definitely want we want to differentiate
quite significantly between like the
different tech levels of the ships I
guess you'd call it
you just gave every VR enthusiasts heart
palpitation saying we're almost out of
time let's talk about Moby glass we
haven't really touched about Moby glass
two questions really one the
responsiveness of Moby glass can
sometimes be a little slow
is that a engineering thing is that a UI
thing you do we have any thoughts about
that you might not be the people to ask
I don't know no I mean I think the
usability of that I mean the the time it
takes to get out you know the animation
and the whole boot up sequence can be
vastly reduced it's just were you know
we're not focused on mobile glass at the
moment
actually the whole UI we're looking to
overhaul on that as well but I mean it's
really just got to set a target time
like 0.6 seconds or something like that
yeah and they'll have as long as we have
that then you know we can fit the
animation around that whatever it needs
to happen
yeah one thing with it I guess it's the
mobile glass is this holographic
holographic display that projects out of
the device itself so there's no reason
why we couldn't have that start to
appear as the arm comes up for example
right I'm waiting 15 right now it's
right now it's very sequential yeah
there's no reason you know especially
with the new Tech's we can we can
actually start start it up now without
you know without having the wait for the
animation to complete okay you know you
just said that mobile glasses and a
focus right now and that's what my
second question was is there anything
you can tell us about the future of
more.we glass eye after so having said
that it's not the focus right now I
suppose is this is similar kind of thing
to the I suppose what we're doing with
the ship MFDs will once we got those the
ship stuff and the visor stuff sorted
out then we probably start to look at
that so we will and I will look at
everything that's that's in there now
and also talk to the game designers
find out what's the what's their overall
overall intention for the game design as
well and try and kind of rework it to
match those and also incorporating the
new tech so it's definitely do an
overhaul I think and we can make it a
lot better so quite looking forward to
that yes because because it's also like
holographic in nature it sort of depends
on the UI tech being able to do 3d as
well so before we even implement that we
need to have the foundational tech to
you actually do the 3d effects that we
want in the mobile glass to be there so
I mean the 2d all the 2d stuff that that
goes on like a flat plane it's that's
all quite far along there's still some
work some engineering work to make it
sleek and kind of slice things up and
make even world panels out of that and
be able to position that anywhere in the
world I have last question gentleman
over let you go this came in from the
live chat it's legitimate I didn't ask
is the UI team hiring and what skills
are needed most well yes I think at the
moment probably the the job specs are
slightly out of date on the website
which will update soon we're definitely
looking for at least a programmer on the
UI team at the moment we've got so much
stuff that people want to put in this
it's kind of sad when you have to say no
to everything so who getting someone
else on board to help help help do that
is good at the moment we're not really
looking for artists and graphic
designers although that may change in
future and I guess if people are
interested in applying
what's the essential things we're
looking for I suppose for programmers
it's the case of being able to show your
experience and also having a knowledge
of what makes good you I really like was
why why do things work that you see in
other games all that kind of thing for
artists we tend to look at
I suppose quite a lot of graphic design
stuff because a lot of our job involves
come up with cool logos and buttons and
that kind of thing so if you go sends
for art that really helps but also this
kind of it's quite hard to teach you but
this understanding
I know if you take a particular screen
why is this screen good on this
particular app or what could I do to
improve it sort of thinking about that
kind of thing is it's a really helpful
skill one thing is part of the also the
UI tech team that we have it'd be
helpful to have should have a tools
programmer as well so right now what
we're working on is kind of a low-level
stuff where I've mentioned a lot of
times in this that everything is now
data driven but that's actually raw data
so when we're actually implementing this
stuff were kind of poking into raw data
so one thing that we want to do that I
kind of tempted to make a head start on
this quarter but is is is the editor for
it's kind of the we there's a low-level
stuff and then there's the layer that
the designers and artists will winter
facelift so creating in a UI editor
that's intuitive and is easy to use is
something that you know we're hiring for
as well so like a tools programmer that
could help build an editor would be very
handy yeah you make a good point we
don't just develop things for for our
backers we actually there are several
members throughout the company whose
purpose is to develop tools for us to
use to develop stuff for the backers
like that so so yeah any any developing
those tools is an essential part of any
game design and but I don't think we
cover it nearly enough on SC on ISC or
anything like that so you just gave me
an idea for another segment so thank you
saying awesome all right that's it
that's all we've got time for this week
saying Simon thank you so much for
taking the time to be here thank you I
think you know we've obviously had Zane
on a TV acceptable but I think this is
both of your first live Friday show how
was it this for me yeah I've done this
before have you done the Friday show you
okay yeah it was surprisingly easy yeah
so yeah good job all right thank you
you're not gonna write a letter to Chris
and like I hated this
not today alright thanks guys that's it
for the show we'll see you next week
take care wait
