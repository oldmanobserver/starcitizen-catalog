hey everybody welcome to our very first
star citizen live subscriber special
event edition brouhaha I should have
read the card but it's over there I
don't I can't see it now this we have a
live studio audience full subscribers
let's show them off
[Applause]
all right that's enough you think just
because you make the show possible
whatever no of course starts in live is
one of the shows that our subscriber
program makes possible it's one of the
many perks of being a subscriber so we
wanted to do something special and
invite as many people so we could fit
into this room which we estimated at 40
and we were just about right so today we
are taking questions exclusively from
our subscribers we have we have a couple
from the folks here that are live and
we'll be taking them of course from our
subscriber chat on spectrum so if you
want if you're a subscriber and you want
to submit a question today you can go to
Robert's space industries com go to
spectrum go to the subscriber section
and put your question there with preface
by question capital letter surround by
brackets so our community management
team can pull it out from the detritus
before we get started with the questions
here we do as always want to introduce
our esteemed panel of guests and John
starting immediately from my right Josh
tell us who you are and what you do for
starts my name is Josh Herman I'm the
character creative director here at CAG
basically I am in charge of all
characters from starting to help at the
idea phase and get them in-game so if
they walk and talk it's a character then
involved in it in some way and making
his return to starts doesn't broadcast
after a long and well-deserved hiatus we
have a lead gameplay programmer and
formerly known as the bug smasher mr.
mark Aiden how you doing work pretty
good
I tell us who you are and what you do I
think you just did no no I said you used
to be a bug smasher but what is it
busily game 5-4 lead gameplay
programmers so there's we have two
league game play programmers here in LA
and my responsibilities is mostly with
vehicles more vehicles and vehicles so
if a vehicle has a problem usually
someone comes up to me and goes hey why
is the guy teleporting when he spawns
into a ship and I look at them and go I
don't know I'll look at it later
[Laughter]
all vehicle bugs I miss bug smashers and
features and features yeah features both
bugs are in the features and last but
certainly not least no stranger to to
our broadcast director of technical
content mr. Shawn Tracy Shawn says who
you're on what you do
Shawn Tracy I'm the technical director
of content at cloud Imperium games that
means it's very broad it's very broad
and it basically as Chris decides that I
need to take a look at something I take
a look at something generally it has to
do with all the content gaming in the
game we have a couple of couple
technical directors at cloud Imperium
and my job is really to keep an eye on
the data and the processes that we all
use to get characters in to get vehicles
in to get props in to get whatever so
yeah it's managing all those pipelines
and of course if this is your first
broadcast or whatever I'm Jared Huckaby
associate creative producer for the
subscription program basically if it
comes from the subscription program I'm
gonna have my hands in it one way shape
or form that's that's a from the new
flair that's been coming out to the
changes in our broadcast recently
basically if it's if it's for our videos
or for our subscriber program I'm one of
the guys for the videos I'm one of the
tremendous team of folks here who would
take too long to name all of them but we
do have Justin you can't see Justin
Justin's over here them so why don't you
be a part of the show I'm happy to have
you here usually alright so we're gonna
get started now with our questions Scott
I understand we've got somebody from our
live studio audience here with us at
nine lives and he's got a question in
our controllers yeah I was wondering
with a new flight model if we could have
separate bindings for throttle forward
and for the straight forward and
backwards right now you can't do
with a new for the straight forward or
backwards and then decoupled from which
yeah I'm using throttle forward but
light be able to strafe backwards and
forwards for things like landing on pads
and you're getting into hangars yeah
where I can just put it under my right
thumb and just stretch backwards and
forwards I'm sure that's probably not
beyond the realm of possibility actually
we should take that in and we'll play it
and put it on the player feedback
there's no reason why we couldn't do
that
not that I'm aware of anyways we did a
pretty massive change anyways four three
five anyways like then we're still we
can control the remapping stuff and
we've got actually what's quite nice is
that we've got resources on this now
which is I used to joke about the button
baron coming in and changing things so
like somebody would just randomly change
frickin key mapping and then everybody
got configure well I mean every single
patch that I have just changed massively
and it was it was enough to drive us
crazy yes yes so yeah it's really good
piece of feedback we'll put it in a
little will review it and then yeah see
what we can do yeah this is the part
where I have to say that's not a
guarantee that's gonna happen or what
everybody no no but I want to make sure
we get them know we make sure we get the
bit of feedback and and and yeah though
Coulson has a lot to do with it anyways
he's not actually doing the control of
it but he definitely has that things to
say about it he has been experimenting
with some things to get that finer
control yep on like atmosphere in that
so that you can get that fine-tuning
yeah he's still prototyping it I'm sure
we'll hear more about it yeah there is
like discussions and prototyping going
on for it yeah cuz what we're what we're
tying with right now is the veto mode
stuff so basically we had the same sort
of requirements or some precision
throttle control so it make sense okay
thank you guys thank you
alright that's C we're gonna take it see
if we have a question from the live chat
here or we don't so who do we got next
Scott yeah let's go ahead and as soon as
you've asked your questions we have to
return this teaser we get the next
person that same inch is pretty Mickey
he's here in that I was wondering what
tech is holding back the implementation
of the function like car
ramps on the target caterpillar for them
to actually go down oh you mean like all
the way down sure that you don't it
opens up but the ramps don't actually go
down and it's not low enough so you can
jump on it also bugs me too and actually
I don't I actually don't know that
there's any tech so when we originally
had that problem it was when we had the
caterpillar
we want to combat it with a few systems
that we didn't have at the time so we
actually went through and built a lot of
systems to do this one of them is called
the interaction state machine and this
thing allows us our allows designers to
specify States using our interactive
statement or interaction system the
interaction system is that thing where
if you hold F and you look at floaty
text words on to enter a ship or
something like that
that's basically our interaction system
so design now has a way to bring in
arbitrary States to say I don't know if
I'm in this state the door opens up the
door closes stuff like that and inside
of that state machine there's ways to do
certain things like playing animation
play sound so forth and there's also
another thing that it says from Game
Code if I do certain action trigger this
state
so without the interaction state machine
parts that we're missing are some of
those variables to say hey switch to
that say hey switch based off that
interaction playtest animation and so
well I'll go back we have all the
animations we have the interaction state
machine we're just missing some of those
things to trigger the state machine to
go into those states so the thing
holding us back is probably it's in our
backlog and just we haven't gotten to it
yet
eventually we like to get to it we just
need to stick a designer to attempt to
bring all those state machines to hit
all those things and if we have to add
some code into it then want some code
into it it's hard because even with 500
plus developers around the world there
are still four night resources yes and
of those 500 there's only so many
designers you know not everybody design
and then I'd like to pick something
there there's not 500 developers by the
500 there's 500 employees yes and which
and a big percentage of that is not
development right so it's not 500
developers so you can find smaller
developers and you have smaller
designers yes then goes smaller to the
designers that are kid that are capable
and knowledgeable work on this and
there's only a few of those designers
that are working on actual ship set up
and everything and the other trouble too
is say we have that tech available for a
designer if we don't have an engineer
ready to help them with any problems
that they come with it so like maybe hey
I'm like hey it's ready go use it they
hook it up if I'm currently working on a
feature for something else and they're
blocked then it they have to wait until
I have time or someone else has time to
go and look at it so I know specifically
that which one that caterpillar thing he
was referring to because it was sent to
a designer then he got switched to UI
and now it's in our backlog until we
could get to look at it again it's just
one of those get to it eventually we
just have to sync a programmer and
designer when certain I know when
production goes or when it's one of
those features that we want to actively
get and get done and working on it's
probably something we'll end up looking
at next quarter to the actor feature
team one of our larger engineering teams
that is a mixed up team yeah designers
engineers animation programmers that so
we're meant to be looking at player
interaction system next quarter anyways
so that might get looked at within there
and you know we have other tech coming
online like the object container
streaming that is a little bit higher
priority so some things do get bumped
down we still want to do them they're
still in the backlog it's just other
party shift sure yeah I want to mix in a
question from the subscriber chat right
now any updates on rows making it into
the PU for instance we recently revealed
the temporal Ranger bikes and people are
asking about roads we've heard Chris
talk in the past about the roads tool
yeah the the person responsible well
that would be responsible for the roads
would be very upset if I said much about
it because it came up
a year ago thought I did some stuff year
later
nobody had used it then they started to
use it didn't work anymore so it was
yeah it's a matter of priority that one
and no there's no real in the next three
months anyways plan for doing much for
roads I think there's gonna be some
stuff in the planetary tools V full
possibly but it's not a guarantee
anyways so yeah kind of a non-answer I
realize but it's there some days but
yeah of course everybody wants roads and
and to be able to set them up but more
realistically we have to be able to
scale up again all the planets that we
need to be able to make so it's you
could kind of got to decide do you want
to zero in on some some smaller not
smaller stuff but specific things or do
we go broad so we can do all the tons of
content that we need to do and the
decision has been right now go abroad
make sure we can actually make all the
stuff we said we're gonna make and then
we can improve the stuff that's there so
yeah Scott you got words on here
hi my question is for mark and maybe
Sean so how do you think scanning is
going to help the exploration mechanic
this game so that is a good question I
don't have a direct answer for that but
what I can tell you is how we're going
about the scanning system so we actually
had a big discussion with junk crew he's
actually the vehicle director so
anything that like the vehicle team will
have to do we have to go to John to make
sure that it it works with all the
pillar directors and if design works out
for all other systems so John did a
wonderful job he went through an entire
radar scanning infrastructure and looked
at all the designs pepped out everything
and gave us basically the scan Bible the
radar Bible of how we want everything to
work and in that we discovered how we
want to finalize what scanning
information and how we get to that
information and how we store that
information
so before I've talked about this before
another chats it is our scan information
has always had like I think we called it
four levels you had the surface scan and
those couldn't just be arbitrary values
for like I don't know the health of a
ship the player name the model name of
the ships and then we have this other
thing called detail scan where you could
have two bits of information for maybe
for the passengers I have the name and
the health the trouble with that system
is it worked a great for a few things
like ships and my Nobles but it wasn't
broad enough where if I scanned a
signpost or an arbitrary cup I could
retrieve information that would be
helpful to me or helpful to a mission
that I'm working on so the scan back in
is getting changed to hold technically
arbitrary information we could store and
this is actually happening right now
we could store any information on like
my noble rocks we caste or any
information to help you get that you
know optimal level to mine to all the
contents inside of it to passengers
there entire faction their their player
health to cargo what type of cargo is it
is it illicit cargo is it stolen cargo
so we're broadening how and we can store
this information and what information we
could put inside of it into a data model
that we could technically store and put
on anything so now that we have this
data model we can technically now put it
on an arbitrary item and design could
put arbitrary information on to there
and this kind of gives us into a little
bit of that random data mission access
stuff where you get a mission and says
maybe you have to go to this location or
someone has stolen this cargo or there's
arbitrary data and I don't know maybe
there's a jump point here or Bob killed
me at this location I don't know you
could store whatever you want in this
arbitrary information box so now that we
have that we could hook up the mission
system to install this stuff we could
hook up the mission system to read this
information
and then the mission guys could act on
that information so that we could have I
don't know a mission saying I want you
to go steal this cargo you get the cargo
and then you have to sneak into an area
because if someone scans you and they
find illegal goods that you can get shot
up so the entire scanning system data
structures changed to allow this bigger
and broad gameplay that we want and how
that would affect I guess exploration is
if you come across the data model or
some kind of information item you could
scan it recover information we could
display it to you so that can be
relevant to I don't know a mission or
maybe something that's Shawn decided to
put his location of where he put his
gold and I killed him and now I could
look oh he put his gold here and this
combination is one two three so it will
open up a lot of doors for design to
make some interesting missions and
hopefully we can provide tools for you
guys to put information into those
scanned data to make that interesting
mechanic and gameplay it's like watching
bugs measures lies we've had lots of
debates of how we want this to work and
how it's going to work with other
systems when we shoot bugs manager they
should just sit next to bark and just
listen to him rule it
well my favorite thing on the bug
smashers was there they said just talk
like you're talking to someone else on
the game and I'm like okay so that's
what bug smashers was it's like I'm just
gonna talk about how the game systems
gonna work is if I'm talking to another
designer or another artist or someone on
one of the things I'm most proud of
about this project is that we never dumb
stuff down for people so much of so many
of our backer community are are in tech
fields are in science fields and
whatever so it's like we trust them to
understand and if they don't they can
look it up hi Josh I got a question from
the live chat for you before we before
we go to the next question here this
person wants to know if we're ever gonna
see you eat uniforms in the persistent
universe a lot of folks that want to
roleplay is you know mustered out
soldiers or
even like a former admiral or so yeah we
actually seen seen quite a lot a chat
about any uniforms in the prison
universe so we haven't had an official
plane and if we're gonna release them in
the PU we know that if we do it will be
after squadron because so much of the
focus of squadron is about the UV but
also at that point we would have to get
into more interesting stuff about like
what ranks people would be because
there's all of our ranks are pretty
fleshed out as far as like what they
wear what the rank looks like what the
colors aren't that are specific outfits
for different types of uniform I think
it's definitely possible I think it
would really depend on what the UE would
be in our game so are they a
peacekeeping force or what are what
exactly are their kills or actions na a
group we already have whatever NPCs for
the Adebisi yeah yeah so I think it
would be once squadron is released we
started talking about what how would
they were right how we want them to be
in the PU having said that the designers
love to try to sneak them in yeah there
have been occasions where like yeah you
know they'll try to populate designers
are allowed to populate the landing
zones with with characters and so some
time they've pulled in Yui out yeah wait
a couple Admiral corpses for a bit yeah
there's a couple of those and we try to
make sure they don't get out there but
aside from accidents yeah collector
squadron yeah alright Scott we got we
got fire medic so nobody has some
precise persistence in halves what can
we look forward to seeing going forward
on like the pathway to full persistence
well there's a misnomer because there's
actually several types of persistence in
our game right mm-hm so that just run
those down real quick so we know what
we're talking about
let me get here you got it go right here
and so there's multiple levels of
persistence the one we're currently
aiming for is going to help us get
server-side streaming so right now we
have a client-side streaming so if I'm a
and this cup goes far away it will
stream out on
for the client it's great because I
don't have to run that asset I want to
run any logic on it I get awesome fps
trouble is that cups still on the server
and it's still updating and is still
ticking so one of the things the next
evolution is to get server side
streaming if there's no one near that
cup the server doesn't need to know
about it but one of the problems that
brings is say we get server side
streaming and that cup goes away if it
was some ship and it got damaged up
because of some combat if we bring that
back on the server we need to bring that
thing back what the damage that it had
and that's where the next evolution of
persistence is and we have a lot of
teams working on we actually have chad
mckinney the other lead gameplay
programmer here in l.a he's working on
it along with a bunch of people in the
UK to get not only the engine setting
this up but the actual persistence
working on that and to get that working
chad is going to have to adjust how and
when we store persistence so right now
with our persistence model if I own this
cup ice or ice this cup can have
persistent information because it's
bound to me as a player but that AI is
not bound to a particular player it's
bound to the server so this is where we
start getting into global persistence
where that cup is saving its persistent
state it's damage its health its who's
inside of it to the server's version of
the persistent information so this model
will allow us to stream stuff in and out
in each dedicated server to unroll a
entity and then bring it back on that
dedicated server that's the fundamental
next evolution of the persistence and
server-side streaming further out you
get stuff like server meshing where
maybe this cups owned by a different
server so then you have to store his
persistent information not relative to
that particular server but into the
global universe
that's a much further away thing so the
first step is the server side and the
server persistence now once they have
that system just like client side
streaming it's going to change a lot of
the game code I'm talking to men
descents to game code so that's why the
entire company most of the engineers are
going to be focusing on this so as the
tech comes available game coders
including myself will have to now change
the system to expect that that Cup is no
longer potentially no longer on the
server so I need to look at that cup and
go what do I need to save in the general
persistence so that when it comes back
it is at its as it was an example of a
system that gets heavily affected by
this is probably the ping system so
right now with pain you could ping out
and you could find things that are
outside of your radar which is cool but
if that cup could be seen by me and it
streamed out on my client and on the
server and I ping out and I'm expected
to know that there's something there I
won't get that any information so now I
have to change the ping code to run
we're calling it a service and that's
basically a it's not the game itself but
it's some extra code that can read the
persistent data so the ping code will
now go a ping service is there anything
within these vicinities that I need to
potentially know about and what that
thing will do is go through that
location find all the persistent
entities that are streamed out and kind
of look at the information and then read
those variables that we stored in
persistence that the ping would need to
know about so that I can display to you
guys that there's something interesting
there so that when you go and fly over
there it could stream in and go oh
there's a ship or Shawn Tracy needs help
because he blew up a ship simple stuff
easy peasy stuff yeah it's like the
world's really easy stuff but seriously
like and
and to maybe just jump on go for that
one the server object container
streaming will have a dramatic effect on
the performance like like dramatic and
there's there's a big reason I'm not
sure how much we've talked about this
but we are with like we are hitting and
honestly we hit them a quarter ago but
we are at a very serious limit right now
of content on the server it's actually
really hard for us even to run our
servers locally on our pcs now because
it's just the sheer amount of RAM that
we need so we've we've gone to a state
that this has to like there is no more
content that we can shove in here we
have to have this yeah I'm working
what's also nice about it though and I
know it sounds like oh all of a sudden
every single game program is gonna have
to work on this full-time what is nice
about it is there's pieces of it that
they'll have to work on so we have all
these feature teams all across so there
will be a core set of guys that are
working on it that will be their
day-to-day you know porchat guys like
this but then what they're doing is that
they're setting up tasks for those game
teams so the guys are still continuing
work on features so for example actor
feature team has player interaction
system inventories all these other
things to be working on that doesn't
stop we're still working on those and
then these guys are gonna be feeding in
tasks that they need to do pretty much
at the same time but this will take
precedent over any feature by far
because this is the thing that's
stopping us and stopping you guys from
having really really significantly
better performance not just on the
clients but on the server's as well and
in the end art server performance yes is
still degrading down and it's only
because there's just too much stuff on
it on the other cool thing about this
too is the persistent team has laid out
an internal basic calendar of when they
want to get certain things in it's not a
direct thing saying this day we're gonna
get this it's more like here we
currently are on the schedule when we
get to this point we're gonna have to
talk to these gameplay teams to get
these things switched over and these
guys have to do these switched over and
those teams will go out do their
switches and when it's done we'll move
the clock forward so it's like a
progression system of sorts we're
turning back the Doomsday Clock we're
turning back to dooms there's a lot back
yeah but content it does give us at
least gameplay engineer
a diagram of when we need to complete
stuff and when we need to switch things
over maybe to go from right on top of
the engine
no no but a huge part no but really big
problems too like our planning and and
and production team and the directors
are on that because even when we started
in on OCS like it took a long time but a
lot of it was we had to approach it
we're kind of approaching some of these
new things from a naive standpoint like
we don't really know what we don't know
as we dive into it but because we've
already done the client server or the
client streaming side of it we already
know pretty much exactly what's gonna
happen in here so we were able to
actually plan this one pretty rigidly
it's not like crazy Rd stuff where we're
like oh you'll have it in three months
and then three months later we're like
actually that's gonna be twelve months
so this is its big props to those guys
yes well it game development not game
construction right right but this one
will be construction is the hope all
right who we got it's got we got nerd
show-and-tell this question hey man hey
when can I have a pet volleyball in the
game when you can have what volleyball
instead actually so you could have a now
if we made the ball I mean it's a big
that's a big ask though that's quite the
asset we're gonna mean we're gonna throw
away in this diverse player this is six
to eight months of work at least for an
artist right there's a turtle and then
you got to rig it and then we got an
animated homeland but seriously we
should be able to put it in out it
didn't be happy when we had a basketball
for a while yeah it was a basketball
house Alex did a bass yeah we did we did
a happy hour back in the day where he
created a basketball right mechanic
because it was seen in the artwork for
the javelin but right he was like a
half-court so so we're like well what we
wanted to see how much it would take to
build an actual
shooty hoop mechanic in Vegas there
wouldn't be from just keeping it
persistent
yeah but the turtle fences now yeah
right yeah anyway there you go I do want
to say that that's not the same as a
commitment that we are going to add a
volleyball s10 saying it's not technic
a huge achievement to get it done yeah
but nerd
let's talk out of the show hey guys got
a good question do you have any details
to share regarding players I to know is
intended to work
we'll eat chip Caray only what you
personally stow or give access to all
items that you do inventory ok this was
coming yeah appreciate the question and
I don't have all the answers yet is the
thing so where inventory has been has
been kind of a weird leave disparate
thing couple teams had you know a piece
of it so
hey the characters they have to carry
stuff around how's the physical
inventory yes yes so hey the characters
have something got to carry things
around hey the ships have stuffs they've
got to carry stuff around hey we have
boxes and you know like there's been a
bunch of different things going on so
what we're doing next quarter and I keep
mentioning this anyways it's on the
roadmap that we'll be looking at
physical inventory which is actually the
entirety of the system so it goes all
the way down to you know a turtle or a
med pen all the way up to cargoes within
the ship being able to put stuff into
those boxes and so so I don't have
really rigid answers right now but I
can't tell you that we are we've got a
holistically tied all these different
designs right now together like a good
example we were just talking yesterday
about how strange it is that we say like
a cargo size on the ships it it's cool
but we've not really made it really
obvious that yeah you have a little
cargo pad in your ship and it's got so
much room but there's nothing stopping
me from just walking in my ship and just
throw in a box in you know so like I
mean to a degree we should be telling
cargo sizes from here's what you can
lash down basically but then you've got
volume within the ship to be able to
throw other things in so yeah the the
main drive for that by the way too is
mostly to do with the players inventory
like being able to take anything from my
from my item port hierarchy and drop it
into the world and it persists and do
all the things that it needs to do and
then that would give you lootable x' and
you saw or would star citizen live is
that what we call a maybe that's what no
that's what this show is oh I'm sorry
you're on
the other one inside star citizens very
different very different inside starts
at you saw what dant Ruffin in that that
team had been working on harvestable
stuff so they're getting whatever they
were oranges they were fruit of some
high heels or whatever there but yet the
players got nowhere to put them right
now so it's like you'd be walking around
with orange peels so we've got to figure
that out is the thing but that'll be for
next quarter yeah now that are that
harvestable collectibles tech they were
using fruit trees because they just
needed something to test the tech but
that kind of tech can apply to surface
side FPS mining it can break it can it
can apply to all kinds of things and the
thing that was hoped that's going to be
holding that up is player inventory
because once you once you grab it you
don't want to go now I've got a fruit
and this is all I can do yeah and I mean
the challenge is in it or just some of
the expectation is that you know Chris
really wants physical everything but
from the art side and from just at the
performance side we don't want
necessarily porcupine characters we call
you're like if you strapped everything
onto the character that you're actually
carrying around it's pretty nuts its
performance issue it's a visual things
and yeah backpacks and basically don't
get to just do this sort of invisible
bag of holding which would be the
obvious answer to a lot of this but it's
not very let's say physical inventory
it's not very star set its low fidelity
no kind of yeah it's a bit of a cheap I
mean it is right we got Scott we got
black dragon tooth let's talk about is
over Deemer alright that's the end of
the show manufacture and what are your
thoughts on making it to varam and
nature now I do want to preface this by
saying we actually have nobody from the
ship team here on the show with us this
week so this is not a question that
anybody here is gonna have the answer I
do happen to know the answer and the
answer is no that we have not chosen a
new manufacturer it's not this it's not
been decided that it needs to change
manufacturers it is definitely something
that we are considering we've spoken
about that before when it was designed
and their diamond was built as part of
the next great starship it was before a
lot of the Aegis style guide had been
completed you know we were still
figuring out what Aegis ships look like
so when you when we had the wonderful
team I can't remember the name does
anybody remember which team did Redeemer
I know yeah I rely on you guys
but I remember all the people in the DI
but I don't remember the people's yeah
called the lassie and so it does yeah I
remember the names I don't remember the
team name but but uh you know that we
didn't have a lot of the age of style I
had to give them so so they were they
were able to freeform kind of kind of
develop their thing but as we develop
the age of style guide internally that's
drifted and separated from what the
Redeemer is right now so the question
that we have to ask ourselves and not
that ask ourselves right now because
it's not currently in active development
but when that time comes is is keeping
the look important enough that we would
change the manufacturer so that we can
keep the look and and maybe apply it to
a different manufacturer or is keeping
an ageist more important and so we
change the overall look to match ages
and there I've seen arguments for both
halves so it's it's not anything that's
been decided just yet
but rest assured uh someplace like
inside star citizen or even this show is
probably where you're gonna find out
when that time comes I want to do one
more question from the chat here for the
folks who couldn't be here with us this
question comes up quite a bit Josh for
character art will will we ever be able
to tell the potential health or damage
to a player by looking at the state of
their armor or clothing yeah we've
talked about this a couple times I think
we've talked about armor we talked about
damaged states we have some technical
artistic limitations right now where
ships have a second they have extra UV
sets where they're able to draw in other
materials to show their damaged States
characters don't have that right now and
to do that would cost additional so if
we want to do that that's an additional
cost but the first thing that we're
actually looking for more to kind of
talk about the whole part of the
question which is being able to actually
see the status of a character or the
type of a character we've been talking
about the different types of suits and
clothing that players would wear and
basically starting to potentially theme
them too
be different jobs so rather than than
everybody wearing similar or wearing
Armour that is essentially stats but a
lot of the armor looks different but it
has very similar stats to change the
stats that fit different types do you
want to talk about that yeah sure maybe
a little bit there's the concept that
each of the armors you know add certain
things to the player stats you know a
good example is damage resistances but
in the end of it the design really is
that we have a very similar to what the
ships are sort of this this power
triangle idea so they do whether they do
good with o2 generation whether they do
good with climate control or whether
they do a little bit better with thrust
it's really going to depend on the suit
itself yeah so not and not the suit as
it will depend on the suit as a whole
but what's nice about the system anyways
is that we we mix and match stuff so
basically you'll be setting up your own
custom profile to a degree so if you
want to do like a heavy Marine Corps
coupled with like an explorer under suit
that's totally fine you're just gonna
have a different profile than somebody
that would go pure heavy marine or pure
yeah each one of those sets will
probably represent or different types of
gameplay so I would expect yeah at some
point you'll that will happen like the
existing armors and stuff you guys have
been using might be briefing to start
fitting those types so Oh an explorer
set is gonna be more towards exploration
so what would that be in gameplay marine
and combat armor is gonna be for combat
so that's gonna have more damage
resistance it's gonna have different
types of things there and I think that's
important so that players can see a
difference in their gameplay but also
from a difference like a distance read
now you just kind of what that
conversation is about like being able to
gauge what a player like the health or
status of a player from a distance this
will help the players gauge what that
player is doing is this an explorer's
there's a medic is this a combat person
is this a bounty hunter like what is
this person from so it's less about
seeing a player and seeing how hurt they
are more about seeing a player and being
able based on your knowledge your
familiarity with it being able to
determine that players overall
capabilities yeah exactly and there'll
be there'll be some stuff as well
so we're we're finishing it well not
finishing but but doing a ton of work
around actor status right now so the
actor status system has not just health
it's not just about health it's about
all kinds of things so hunger and thirst
and knocked down resistances and things
like this so you'll be able to tell to
degree is all you know provided through
animation and things on it like what a
player status is sort of what his
current status kind of is but yeah
whether you can tell the difference
between somebody had 10% health or 30%
oh no you're gonna have to use FBS
scanning and all that kind of work to do
that we do have dirt and wear which will
affect it but that doesn't necessarily
relate to the health of the player like
dirt or wear on an item just means that
it's been used it could just be
something that they use all the time but
that's not their current status that's
the the long-term effects on an item
it's a different thing but long story
short we would like to have the exact
same ship damaged yeah blue light series
I'd love to have that but it is it's
absolutely problem to the CV to channel
and we need to use that UV to channel
for other things on the character so
it's a matter of literally a data set
just not existing for it so we got we've
got Swiper the Fox
we'd Salvage on the roadmap for the end
of the year what do we expect the
initial rollout to look like as far as
gameplay goes and what technical hurdles
do we have to overcome before we can
start seeing some of the systems in the
reclaimer come online yeah one of the
big ones is inventory so there's
physical inventory stuff that we're
talking about that that's absolutely a
big one for Salvage on top of that
probably a little bit as a player
interaction when we're talking about
actual like character Salvage if that
makes sense but in terms of any tech
limitations on the ship stuff I'm not
really I'm not sure of any I've seen
some early designs and prototypes but I
don't know anything that's get finalized
on that yet so I can't really say
because it's also on a different team
mmm
but I know one of the hurdles off the
back because it's something on arts
vehicle team is the way that we generate
these de breeze entities when a ship
gets destroyed right now when we
generate these de breeze entities we
kind of just take the item and move it
over and then it's magically there it
doesn't have any of the pipe connections
or persistent information and it kind of
just will spawn vanish and then that's
it so we kind of need a more robust
system to keep them there and have a way
to extract items and maybe potentially
the resources that's on those debris
pieces the other thing is probably going
to be like our debris right now if you
blow up a ship and you look on the
inside usually this looks like an empty
husk and maybe a seats floating our
ships spawn object containers inside of
our inside of the ship so it's object
ators just have a collection of entities
brushes and all sorts of things we want
those things to remain when a ship turns
into a debris piece but there are some
technical limitations on why they don't
so if you put some big Bennie's in the
inside of your Cutlass and it explodes
you would kind of want those big
vanities to still be there or any items
you place on a cabinet or something so
we have to solve how we're gonna keep
those and how we transfer those object
containers and the states that they're
into those debris pieces so that
whatever mechanic you use you could
extract it outside of the debris piece
or somehow melt or turn those chunks
into some kind of commodity I've seen
prototypes of just turning that debris
piece and using the mining laser on the
prospector to extract it for me or do
extract those things out but that was
just a prototype of what if we did this
it's not like the final thing of how
it's going to get implemented so long a
short answer I don't know but I have
seen interesting things yeah to
prototype it it's kind of the same thing
on the FPS mining front we were thinking
the exact same thing we just grabbed
pieces and essentially just mining
pieces of
and even if that's like the first
version it's a way to give like you guys
a system to try out until we get
something much more complicated the
amenities gonna have to have a lot of
preservatives to survive the destruction
of the Cutlass though yes not torpedo
burrito well see I get a shield I put it
around the big Benny and then I blow up
the ship now you're thinking about
science let's move on Scott what do you
got we've got ghost of a wanderer my
question has to be when can we expect to
see an update to the female rig and item
handling specifically with delivery
boxes my box it's here yeah so I can't
see anything when I just notice all over
I can't see the screen
that's a metrics issue that's funny yeah
okay won't be able to do anything to
deliver the boxes and I can't like I
can't touch it with it yeah I mean the
animation thank you so much for doing
that yeah so I was like I think we kind
of said with the first rollout of the
female player was it was definitely a
work in progress
like I think we were all pretty happy
with how it came out with where she was
delivered because there's a lot that was
going into that from all the items from
all of the animation stuff for all the
ship stuff there was a lot it wasn't
just a single system so is that kind of
stuff that you're experiencing is
unfortunately one of those we just
haven't gotten to it or haven't caught
it yet obviously that's something we
have caught because we've run the
missions but it's just one of those
we'll get there and it's one of those
things we're updating because it's it
could be animation issue it could be
design issue it could be a metric issue
and whenever you start getting into
skeletons of different sizes you
immediately run into metric issues just
some of the things we initially
encountered on the ships but it does
become issues with things like items
that all players are going to handle so
the boxes are a big one of those and
then other things are like cover yeah
cover heights different types of things
of you know if you set and a lot of
games you set a very standard cover
height where if you like walk up to
something you can perfectly peek over it
but if your player is five or six inches
shorter and if she can't look over it
and that becomes a problem
so just kind of as we roll the female
player out further going through some
more of those buggies they're not really
bugs but they're like there are things
that we hadn't had to encounter yet and
so now we go back and we just basically
just fix them yeah so I mean whatever
that animation is right now that carries
the boxes for sure just to transfer the
mail yep and then whether that was not
checked in first person or something
better though or they put it in a vase
but it's not a dramatically hard hard
fix no it's a good feedback though thank
you for saying it we got Scott we got
cleric Anubis hey guys my question is
when are we gonna be allowed to follow
more than the actual current cap of
players that we can follow our friends
list question any you know us to stuff I
why is that limited I think that goes on
with just our performance with our just
how much stuff that we have in our
servers right now we're at that cap as
Sean mentioned earlier we're adding more
is just we're ready at the extreme yeah
so if we need to get the server side
persistent stuff up and running so that
will allow us to get more content inside
and potentially more players inside but
before we throw in more players we want
to make sure that we have the tech and
it's it's stable enough to extend it I
think you're more asking about like
contact list you talk about the
forensics right he's talking about a
list of name
oh the friends list yeah I'm pretty sure
we got enough overhead to add some more
player news I don't know that would
probably be a question that and us it to
and know us to we're Benoit yeah I'm on
his team let me let me let me let me
just go ahead and say we don't have the
people here for the answer for that but
I'll chase it up and I'll see if I can't
get an answer to tyler witkin and see if
he can't put it on spectrum later
because i would like to know the end
what's the limit right now it's 50 it's
50 right is it 50 does that is the girl
is it - is it up to 250 now you got more
than 250 friends right I can't even feel
50 it seems like it may have just been
an arbitrary limit that someone added
yeah totally yeah no they're saying it's
250 note C so yeah alright so Wow you're
way more popular than I am dude all
right I haven't accepted your who we got
nice big Benny Street yes we can go
piano long that that's bootleg big baby
shirt though last night in all fairness
my wife did so credit that doorman
thanks for this you guys so question
probably for for Shawn or for for mark
when we get server side object container
streaming in a local region what do you
think our peak player count will be for
either ship combat or a first person
shooter combat well good question it's
pretty theoretical though I mean I
remember whatever you say right now is
about to be taken as gospel yeah it's
the law it is absolutely what we have to
do okay whatever you say right now you
mean local like for example like in
Portola sir like how many people will be
put in there and it's gonna be gospel
ten million
[Laughter]
ten million a server you're welcome see
yeah it's really hard to say I mean this
is gonna sound like a horrible answer
but as many as we can get that's
probably gonna be the answer what will
probably happen is we'll have our
current count put people in it go to
evocati see what happens put more people
in it see what happens yeah that's
probably the reason we have yokai's
reason we have the public test universe
it's when we feel that we got that we
got the overhead we'll start cranking up
it's how we got the 50 and and we do
have more sophisticated testing they're
just dropping it on a table vacati we
have you know I just went over it all
this morning actually cuz we have to
increase some player counts for
something else
the we have headless client testing as
well as the player testing so ahead
those clients are basically just a
method for me to connect however many
clients that I want they don't do
anything they just get in there and like
actually I really hope they just did
like random jumps or something like this
I just need data but yeah we can connect
a bunch there so we'll be doing
profiling around it that's the whole
thing but server object consuming server
object container streaming by itself
probably not going to make that and it's
super dramatic
it is super dramatically improved what
will bring that one is server meshing
that's when it gets crazy because then
we can actually shunt players from you
know server to server so so
realistically I mean I can't give a
number it's really hard to say say but I
hope a lot yeah as many as we can hey JJ
the TV's about to shut off we have a
screen so the people here can watch it
hasn't been touched for a while so it's
got the power down all right Scott who
we got publican advances bits Rahul
mantra or Haram are closed hey guys my
question is uh what are the current or
future plans to keep players engaged
during a really lengthy quantum drum oh
I don't
like an ya bits oh I'm not good you okay
that is there is a topic of a lot of
active discussions right now and it's
one of those things that can go one way
or the other way and if we talk about
one way and we end up going the other
way we get too excited for this and we
end up doing this we're gonna disappoint
half the people yeah so that's so it's
it's a really dangerous thing for us to
get into it right this second it goes to
a lot of white when you when you watch a
TV or is here whatever you know why
aren't they talking about this it's
there's a phase that certain things get
into where it can it can sig auric and
zag and the zig and zag are really big
you know we're talking about a degree of
change we're usually okay you're sharing
that with me because if it changes it's
only gonna change a couple degrees here
but the stuff that we're talking about
right now is a big zig or a big zag and
it would be irresponsible for us to get
you super excited for the zig and then
we end up doing the Zap which will also
be awesome but you'll end up having
gotten your heart set on the zig so I'm
gonna say I'm up put the kibosh on you
have another cookie who was it is there
something else you want because it's a
great question and we're close to being
able to to hopefully tell you something
about maybe just knowing that yeah we
know we know
oh we know we know it's you know pretty
crappy to have a boring if you want to
ask another question tell Scott after
this and we'll see if we can get you
back up for anything
we got we've got hypersonic one a
gentleman loved the verse love
everything about it
my main question as a hauler and a drug
smuggler I'm wondering in its IRL he is
wearing a Breaking Bad t-shirt one thing
I would hope for is eventually to be
able to spawn ships on outposts when
they get stored accidentally or on
purpose and that's kind of a big issue
for us right now yep we want that too
yes I believe there are gosh I feel like
at one point there was an outpost where
we could spawn vehicles in that a spawn
ground vehicles on planets right now but
yeah so it's just a question of you know
making pads big enough
and being able to spawn your ships there
and not making it so it's a magic
teleport you know you park your ship at
OSR and you hit your rides the main you
hit your ride the Hurston and then you
spawn your ship at Hearst and now you've
got the Hearst and you know danger free
it's not like that so there's a lot of
considerations for some like that but
being able to fly your ship to Hearst
and land it at a pad that's in it
outpost or something and then do you
spawn it and respond it that's
definitely something I know that that we
want ya know is the main thing and and
Jared hit it is Chris just doesn't want
you to be able to teleport your ships
around which is totally reasonable
because we want to again if you're going
out on a mission that needs the
caterpillar you want to make sure that
caterpillar is close by or you're gonna
have to think about something else or
you've got to move this stuff around the
universe that's that's kind of the idea
is that it doesn't just teleport from
you know Hurston to port olisar to arc
warp it just doesn't move like that
you've got to move that ship that's up
to you to make sure your fleets in the
right places to do the right stuff which
i think is a cool thing yeah it's a
little bit of you've got to take a
little bit of foresight into what you're
gonna do but there's no reason why and
I'm pretty sure Chris wants us to that
yeah you landed an outpost you store
that ship basically so you can then
recall it back at that given outpost but
if you go away from that you die or you
go back to poor dollars or something
like that no no you got to go back to
that outpost go get that ship there's
also the it's just like having
physicalized inventories up if it's a
small little box building with a landing
pad like where would your ship
conceivably go he doesn't want to just
disappear into the ether maybe some
slightly bigger outpost that could have
that could conceivably have underground
garages and you know your ship lands and
then you know goes down into ground
that's where it stories we always want
to look for that solution that we've
even talked about really really crazy
stuff like crazy stuff like interesting
things like having even putting up
missions as ship valleys so for example
I I am at this outpost and I need my
caterpillar from arccorp I can put up a
service beacon that says can somebody
bring my caterpillar yep over to our
corporate or whatever and I think that's
kind of a nice thing and I love it I
really like these features
that or designs that we talk about that
give you guys a lot of agency to create
gameplay to a degree for example I
always talk about this like giving you
guys some like these like 10 racing rods
or something like that so you can set up
a little race for yourself I love the
idea of player beacons so that you can
set up a mission so that other people
can do things with it or or or be you
know trolled and you know thinking that
you need help or you don't need help and
we like to give that sort of agency to
you guys but yeah
you ever see what's your in-game name
John Criminal Procedure Imanol sending
out a distress beacon just don't trust
it trust it
I want to another car you linger the
chat the the chats on fire for you today
Josh Oh hair tech months ago now we
showed a teacher Pacheco she had this
awesome set of hair and we put a hood on
her she came out and she had a hoodie on
that hoodie oh yeah what's the dealer
has tear tech going uh hair tech is
going well but right now we're kind of
in the phase where we're trying to
finalize the pipeline of how we create
the assets so we know that we can make
the assets we know that we can get them
to run well and look good but the speed
that it takes to make them is much
longer than we want so we're developing
a bunch of tools basically that help
speed up that process you do not have to
do it one here it's at a time know we're
combining a lot of really cool tools
multiple you can groom the hairs in Maya
and then we export them so we're doing a
bunch of cool stuff where we're able to
style stuff in the game and not in the
game but in an export of to stuff in the
game but it's just taking a little while
to get the tools because we want them to
be really smooth we want to make sure
that there's not a it should be really
user friendly to make this typically
here as an asset type is really
difficult to make in any type of
production and it can be really tedious
so we're trying to speed that up so that
we can make as many different types and
as we can so that also probably will
answer some questions that you might
have about why you haven't seen new hair
stuff yet or why there are vast styles
or whether
not a big difference in styles or why
there's not long hair styles or all
questions that we are valid and that we
have as well but it all basically
depends on those tools being completed
so that we can make the assets quickly
so that we can replace and add new
things and already just to give some
context to that to the the the process
that we have got online is still faster
than usually here it would take anyways
so so we've already got big improvements
but because of the sheer amount of
content that we've got to make it's got
to be faster than ever right like I just
the process has to be the fastest and
we've ever used so that we can automate
off as much as absolutely possible for
the artists so yeah because yeah we have
a whole new so you know they're games
man yet you are going down to her hair
rules all new doing everything so yeah
it's a lot of work but we don't want to
and of course we don't want to keep
using the old text so that's why you
don't just see more errors you know
thrown in there for that but tech wise
we're pretty much done it's just it's a
matter of getting it fast enough so that
you know how many how many characters we
have or not you know not not a massive
team by any stretch also from the
subscriber live chat here will we ever
see a compass or a direction finder our
helmets folks want to know just which
way is up yeah but round which way is up
right you've got zones so well we've got
a planet in the universe where's North
where's up okay but say on a plan you
know can our planets have a magnetic
north they do but so we can we have a
cup of you align it - oh yeah I think I
think I think Coulson talked about this
once anyways like he came up yeah
but they want to put it on the head and
they're looking at that on the HUD for
the ships anyways right now I don't know
about the character though we often get
questions about not just company not
just compasses but a coordinate system
for profiles for being able to find your
location planner or being able to
moderately tell people I am at this
coordinate on this planet
keep yes please planets and we've talked
a lot about the challenges of that
because we have fully three hundred
really us realize 360 degree yep
yell and NASA and those you have the
coordinates for this planet but then
you've got the coordinates for the other
planet you've got the coordinates for
the moons and how you transition between
also to get really accurate like we can
output coordinates we output them all
the time like QA has to do that all the
time for us right now it's like this
long to get real exact in the sheer size
that we have the the precision of that
number is it needs to be it's pretty
high yeah would be would be not awesome
to read that song another follow-up
question on the Herrick Josh this this
subscriber wants to know when we can see
some additional hairstyles for your
female characters yeah that'll all come
after the tools so once we create that
we have a whole catalog of stuff that we
wanted to make even if the hairstyles
that you can use now we actually have
more that we could put in the game but
we kind of thought that we would kind of
stall for a little bit so that we have
time to not have to update and there's a
lot of bugs that come with hair as
you've probably seen where they stick
through helmets or they they sort really
oddly at certain angles and they try to
limit all of that just to put less in
because we know that eventually we're
gonna replace it all anyways with this
all new and better stuff so once those
tools are done we'll we'll have more
styles and better styles and just
generally more hair things and also one
other point on top of that is that yes
they are making some hairs that's going
into squadron right now that's yeah yeah
so they're like arrow characters from
squadron so you guys just don't see them
and we don't want to we don't want to
just take one of the hero
characteristics yeah drop it in as is
exactly so it's kind of we're trying to
be you know smart about where we're
where we're spending our time of you
know we've got like II was saying we
have only eight or so cared artist which
is a big team but it's not a massive
team to support you know doing R&D on
tools building new styles you know it's
just placing your people the best you
can get a hairstyle
that's a good question just little hair
yeah I think you doesn't have to
similarly hair if it does simulate never
know early yeah like that one
Tyler sending me a couple questions it
seems suspicious about hope not wine
straits I know that's him but also
backwards ball caps and flip-flops in
what okay it's all time you have caps
collared recipes Johnny Joe I don't kind
of think Joe exists we can definitely do
back to my ball caps we just need to
make the assets no Tyler wants it so no
is that something that we want no
sometimes I think we should have I might
ask two more questions because we are
actually a little bit over time now but
I'd like to get through here some of
these are pretty nice are there we
haven't had an update on scars and
tattoos for a while yeah anything we've
seen the first version of character
customizers
yeah a lot of the updates and the
characters we're doing right now are
mostly on the the DNA side so like the
facial side so that's continuing to
being worked on yeah and I think I
talked about the last time I was on like
okay we have tech tech right now for its
facial decals and basically what it is
is yeah you could do a tattoo or you
could do face paint kind of stuff with
it doesn't do scar as well though is the
thing so what the tech is is the decal
layer that can go on top of the problem
is it only really changes the diffuse
and it's on purpose it takes all the
skin shading and stuff from underneath
so it looks a lot like it looks a lot
like a tattoo or face paint would look
so that would work fine for tattoos we'd
have to come up with the item board and
all the ones that we want to actually
apply to you the other problem is we
don't have a really like a really good
way right now to place it somewhere and
then further we'd have to persist it as
well so we'd have to put a port we'd
have to get the offset forward-facing to
you guys and then from there but tech
wise we'd be okay for scars it's a bit
of a different story because scars need
a normal map they need depth because
otherwise it looks super cakey like
somebody just like literally you know
painted a scar on somebody it would look
just the same way so we need something
that would actually make a normal or
change the neural maps and why that gets
complicated is it wouldn't be so bad
it was just a face normal map but
because we've got wrinkled maps and all
these 44 different areas of normals that
come in anyways so now you've got to put
the scar across 44 different texture it
gets a little bit crazy right so because
we've done some of these pieces of tech
with that that that again make the faces
look as good as they do right now it
kind of makes a little harder to put
those scars and things like that in what
I'd prefer to do quite honestly is not
even have scars forward facing to you
guys but make that happen to your
character throughout the course of its
life his or her life I still like the
concept of them being having
life-changing events yeah if you get
Gibbs on the left shoulder or something
like this every time you respawn you've
still got a scar left over that actually
goes back like I think that's a much
cooler approach because then it's then
it it tells a story right over time that
your character is experience these
different things they're talking about
before with the armor I think yeah that
I think we've actually spent more time
because of the tech limitations on the
armor about the sort of the death of a
spaceman yeah how would that happen what
could happen to your player over time
degredation of what they look like or
scars or limbs like what would we do
with that stuff yeah I think that's more
so yeah I hope that's where we that's
where we take it all not only scars but
yeah you know bionic limbs and things
like that if you respawn you know you're
your 50th time responding or something
like that guess what your DNA has des
degraded to such a point that you no
longer have a right leg so you get to
have a bionic leg the rest of your life
you know the rest of your respawn life
or a scar or whatever I just think it's
really cool to have these life-changing
events that really tell the story for
that given character I think it's an
interesting thing one last question for
anyone what technical challenges need to
be overcome to bring ship to station and
ship to ship docking on my ship what
ship the station or ship to ship docking
I don't know yeah no no it's more we are
just running through our characters I'm
sure for mark gaben is the same we're
both thinking ourselves well there's
nothing really
well I think it's a magical stream which
the sierras magical stream
oh the refactor bits so I don't we talk
about I don't know this is where I get
nervous yeah so CR is an amazing
programmer and he has this nice little
stream where he is changing a lot of the
underlying ways of how we attach things
and he has the support of a lot of the
lead programmers in engine tech so in
this stream he's changing how we attach
things tuned from different things and
one of the problems we have with our
current tech is if we want to attach a
ship to another ship a whole slew of
problems we cut rise because the ship
has an interior physics grid with a
bunch of object containers and if you
attach it to another one of those the
code doesn't handle it great and it just
has problems so in that stream he has
provided a way to fix those issues so
that I could attach a ship onto a ship
and it would work as you would expect
and if we get that tech past QA we fixed
some of the bugs that has resulted from
it it would open up the doors to give us
that ability to bring a ship on a ship
so that you could dock a ship directly
on another ship like right now I think
on the constellation there's a fake
Merlin just because we don't have the
ability to attach another ship on a ship
if we get this tech we can then do this
we could attach another ship on the ship
so that's one part of the problem the
other part of the problem is persistence
so if we do attach the ship on another
ship we have to have some kind of game
code understand that the ship is on here
so that when we stream it out instrument
back in the States and connections are
established then there's also the other
aspect of gameplay what does it mean to
dock another ship on a ship do we have
to vent atmosphere in one to another do
we have to decompress there's another
side of it that's getting handled by I
think it's David Coulson yeah
so it's coming and there's pieces
getting it to there so once all the
pieces are in play I think that's when
you'll start hearing more about it of
course
that's about it I got one last question
it's actually for me it's from the cigar
chat about we've been doing a lot of
talk lately about a potential a revamp
to the subscription program and the
question though is just when are we
going to learn more about that we're in
a state for those of you who haven't
watched the first episode of I of
insight sources and four weeks ago now
Kris and Sandy were on towards the end
talking about how we want to do some
some revamps the subscription program
not just the smaller ones like we're
doing currently changes to a subscriber
Flair that you've already seen but we
want to we want to pursue larger changes
more in-game than if it's more tangible
things that the presenter greater value
of course subscription subscriptions
make shows like this possible and
whatever but we want subscriptions to do
a whole lot more it's not it's already
it's you know the shows and it's the
jump points and it's the wreck and it's
the ship of the month and it's the
subscriber promotions that go on every
month and it's early access to events
and there's a there's a whole bunch of
subscription perks right now but we
think that after we're in our sixth year
the subscriber program now I'm looking
at you like you might know I think we're
in about our sixth year the subscriber
program we're ready to push it forward
and see and see where we can take this
program so it's not just a hey you know
give us some extra capital and help make
our programs nicer we want to we want to
see if we can't make your star citizen
experience a better buy it as well now
of course you we're still we're still in
that zig-zag fray Taipei's it's just
like the quantum travel thing if I
talked about any of the specifics that
we're considering right now and we don't
go with that then we yield
disappointments and stuff so we're not
quite ready to talk about the specifics
just yet but but rest assured that the
discussion will happen in a forum much
like this you know you will talk about
the options when we're ready
to to keep it to go forward with it and
we're very keen on the ideas or we're
very keenly aware of the pay2win and
stuff like that so it won't be we're
gonna try to steer clear that stuff or
whatever so it's yeah in case you guys
missed at the beginning of the show I've
recently been made a creative producer
for the subscription program so that's
why you're starting to see some changes
it's a big part of my responsibility
coming forward so so we're in tight
little talks with a Tony Zurich with a
todd papy with the design team the
missions team to find ways to to
incorporate the program within the
persistent universe more and make it
much more attractive for you so in room
you know you help us we help you that
day I think that's a fair trade-off and
that's where we want to go with that so
yeah that's it for a subscriber event
thank you so much mark Shaun and Josh
for taking the time to be here with us
on the show this week we've never had us
live studio audience before I hope you
guys enjoyed it okay
[Applause]
[Applause]
alright alright that's it well no more
JD this wrap it up in something that get
back to work that's ing climax uh go
back to work you've been watching the
star citizen live I didn't Jared Huckaby
and you're not there you go yay yay
that's how it ends it's real time really
like bozo
