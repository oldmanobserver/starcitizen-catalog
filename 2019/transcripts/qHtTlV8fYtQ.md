## Transcript

hey everybody welcome to another edition
of star citizen live this time with the
audio team audio design and programming
I'm your host Jared have to be in
joining us on the show here from
beautiful sunny actually suddenly start
no that's just the stage that's just the
light not the Sun was coming on not here
but I feel great
perpetual gray joining us here and
you're not sunny Winslow three members
from the audio team let's start from the
left from the far left and just tell
everybody who you are and what you do
for star citizen I'm Josh and I'm sound
designer on the audio team and we just
had a big segment explaining what sound
designers do on is yesterday so I'm not
going to ask you to repeat that today no
deleting my collarbone how much you know
my name is Phil Pierce woods and I'm the
lead sound designer and beard maven for
the audio team absolutely yeah yeah I
grow one every six months and I'll just
reset it was never as epic as yours
let's face it but well I haven't had a
happy beard and like your I spend
enormous on graves two years it was
always epic that's never coming back and
last but certainly not least Graham
tells who you are and and you have to
tell us what you do for starters only
because you're not a designer
okay well hello my name's Graham
Phillips and I'm lead audio programmer I
wear mostly brown and I try my best to
provide tools for these guys to make the
game sound amazing so yeah so we have
two audio designers want audio
programmer on the show this week if you
haven't yet left yesterday I'm inside
star citizen we did a nice little kind
of lifestyle piece updating on the life
and times of Audio designers working for
c IG today we are answering questions
live about either sound design or sound
programming we did put up a question in
spectrum early this week to start
collecting questions earlier so we're
going to start with those questions
while we go through these you can submit
your questions for consideration into
the twitch chat by pressing your
question with the word question in
capital letters surrounded by brackets
I'll help us pull it out from all the
other chat and of course remember if you
want a good shot at your question
actually being
asked and then answered make sure it
actually deals with audio design and
audio programming and not is a not
staging your question as a backdoor
question to find out what when we're
adding flora and fauna fauna to the game
which one of the most uploaded questions
in the spectrum thread was was basically
one of those sitcom things or it's like
yeah what kind of sounds you guys
playing to do when you are at fauna to
the game and what kind of funded you are
you intend to work on first about when
in your schedule do intend to work I
mean it's like it's like okay your
question was about fun it wasn't about
but okay so right off the bat can we
expect to be able to detect mechanical
malfunctions or problems or disruptive
components before they fail by audio
cues basically you know obviously is
more and more the component system comes
online you know show regulators and and
and generators and so like that as they
wear down will there be subtle audio
cues that people can listen to so that
they know you know that rattle means
something's not quite right like it's
the performing okay right now but I
maybe better go take a look at it yes
that's definitely the plan the only
stuff we don't touch sounds to any mmm
components other than like thrusters and
the quantum drive and stuff at the
moment but as we start to add sound to
power plants and life-support and
avionics and marketing stuff they
definitely will make sound from the
location where the component is and
based on the condition of the component
and all arcane stuff its degradation
level its help out how much it's powered
on all that kind of stuff will
definitely off sounds coming from those
locations so you'll be able to tell
roughly the state of it based off the
sound we already kind of do this at the
moment just based on the ship's overall
health so the sound of all of the
movement sounds on the ship and even the
ambience of the ship now changes based
on how damaged the ship is and we also
turn off the vibrations when the ship is
more damaged which is cool that was a
relatively recent addition I think maybe
three six yeah
how difficult is it one of the things we
talked about a night scene was how
difficult it is to mix from multiple
perspective because you can never quite
tell where the player is going to be
when you when you're when you're doing
something like that when you're trying
to communicate the health of an entire
ship do a player through sound how
challenging is that didi do you mix it
for the pilot seat yeah lay as default
yeah you start with the first-person
perspective
pilot seat you mix for that first I
guess what with like a single seat a
fighter you do you know you'd expect to
hear all that stuff from just the pilot
seat cuz there's no other no other
perspectives really but um yeah it's
quite a challenge really especially like
first-person pilots see third-person
exterior camera is all good but then
testing it from like in a large ship
like kind of getting like you know fly
getting the ship to be flowing while you
walk around it and check it sounds good
from other rooms and stuff can be quite
the Challenger and yeah you never really
gave perfect people are started filling
out the interiors of show like hey guys
I'm on the bottom on the bottom here the
components I'm Ariel weird noise you
guys hear something yeah anything up
there we're gonna have this we kind of
want to have this idea of like different
like think about what the engineer and
the engine bay would think think about
what the person in the drone Bay would
think what the word would he have
nothing but here what the you know the
turret gunner needs to hear all this
kind of stuff and then we've got like a1
all these multi-crew things almost elyda
fied then we've got like a list of like
roles and think of an audio mix for each
of those roles rather than just each
room yeah
what are the questions from the chat was
where is the sound of flybys we've had
players in the game for some time
possibly yeah I would love to check and
they were reimplemented as part of the
new flight model quite a while ago and
then I found a problem with them and fix
that a little while ago and
haven't checked them in a while and I
know they've generally got a bit quieter
and it takes a bit more of a kind of
crazy flight maneuver to trigger the
loudest one and maybe people aren't just
aren't getting up to those kind of
speeds and atmosphere anymore and we
need to readjust fill up but yeah
they're saying that they're basically
been toned way down yeah like that
I remember the Buccaneer flyby used to
do just massively cool yeah big engines
those big Drake engines are running by
that's nautical but uh yeah you know
that's one of the things that's
continuously balanced and realist and so
all right will we eventually get to hear
the effects of our own voices in
proximity boy for instance when we're in
a cave we currently don't hear our own
echo or reverb but we can hear everybody
else's yet that is absolutely planned it
does come with its own challenges
compared with just hearing the effects
on other players voices because other
players voices we receive over the
network and we can play the effects on
them immediately in terms of the players
voice you speak the game hears it and
then the game applies effects and
there's like an inherent latency in that
and we we need to minimize that latency
prevents it from being a kind of
emergent breaking effect because it
needs to be an effect adds to what
you're experiencing doesn't take
anything away from it
so I expect we all need to create
bespoke effects for the players that
slightly different reverbs to what we're
hearing when everyone everybody else but
then ultimately feel the same you know a
lot of the tech is already there we just
need to spend a little time kind of
tweaking it and making it do its thing
yeah it's gonna be in there at some
point we all sort of consider feedback
right if you're hearing your own voice
propagate back through the game and
that's getting picked up on your
microphone and then just going through
again and so there's some practical
limitations like maybe resulting people
having to wear headphones more often you
are the other thing where you struggle
to talk because you hear your own voice
slightly delayed you want to know that
we won't be playing back your own voice
because we're not trying to create a
voice jammer here be adding yourself
Reverb tailor your voice
mmm-hmm in effects this appropriate to
the area and it shouldn't be anything
that kind of you know makes you feel
like you're drunk okay the chat says
sound seems to have been greatly
improved in 30.7 thank you that was all
me could you summarize the work that was
done none of that was me you guys okay
what you do in 317 well we start off
with a massively talented all your team
and the guys are really good at what
they do and they'll see like issues and
drip on hot fixes and stuff but
primarily we're just supporting the
upstream features and content that comes
down the pipe and the tech and tools are
constantly improving we work closely
with fullier programmers so they helped
was get sounds in more streamline the
process and stuff so we can have more
time to spend on iteration and stuff
like that I think in the past few
patches we've been reintroduced a lot of
like dynamic mixing things didn't we so
like you know we can learn if like in
the past I think if there was like 25
ships on screen at once you'd hear them
all and it would just kind of become a
bit of a bit of a mushy soup of sound
and now you can you know we can focus in
on the ships that are the most other
closest to you or otherwise the most
important and just play those ones
mm-hmm so the rest of them down are all
are kind of stuff so you hear it might
seem it'll seem cleaner and more punchy
when really there's just actually less
stuff going on more focused mix yeah
yeah so less is more approach which is
partly about making the mix clearer and
it's also partly about optimizing the
game because we want to preserve your
frame rate as much as we possibly can
mm-hmm it's always a it's always a
battle with resources really Chad says
you didn't left has the best hair ever
which left your left Milo you're on my
satellite it's like you've got States
right but yeah you were left so I don't
know what he means Esther what one of
you
how does it sound Jared and it has the
Harrison
and see what else from the chat here
what kind of changes are planned
regarding dynamic sound adjustment based
on how miss peer pressure
like for instance sounds becoming
quieter and more muffled as air pressure
approaches zero so there's some work I'm
going to improve the way that audio
propagates through different areas and
we have a system in game already which
allows us to have different pressures in
different areas so we can have a highly
pressurized room and then a lower
pressure atmosphere outside and then
beyond that no air pressure as you leave
the atmosphere and I'm currently working
a lot of tech that's going to accumulate
those effects and then apply them at the
point where the sounds heard so we
should be seen at some point over the
next couple of releases I would say we
should be seeing some great improvements
on how the pressure path from the sounds
of the player is represented by what you
hear so if they have any bearing on size
booms well I mean it has a bearing on
everything because it's a it's a core
sort of feature of the tech so it's
gonna be applied to everything as far as
the sound designers wish to use it so
yeah I mean sonic booms are there a
special case really because we don't
actually we don't represent the speed of
sound in the sense that you don't of
hear things so much later after the
event we have considered doing that at
some point and we maybe will but then
you know sonic booms are a different
thing because we have different
atmospheric pressures so it's not as
straightforward as what it's a sonic
boom on earth it's like a sonic boom can
happen at completely different speeds
depending on the atmosphere that you're
in seems that every time that we do a
audio base show that question comes up
to some points yeah see if let me get it
out of the way I would just get it out
of the way right there let's see does
the audio team know of any tech out
there that could possibly make the non
bespoke characters at admin desks and
shops have more variation in their
voices without having different actors
for each one so basically the same with
a sheer volume of NPCs you do anything
to make their voices sound different
besides just recording different people
right now the answer is no we can apply
pitching effects and filtering and
things like that and it always just
sounds unnatural so we like to stick
with you know the quality of stars' it
isn't the whirring for it we want it to
sound real so we don't want to make
anything that we have sound any worse
than it already does and that's a
terrible stain generate the audio at all
what I should have said but we are
always keeping on top of developments in
machine learning
ai and as soon as we feel like it's a
good time for us to start to investigate
that we certainly will because we know
that yeah we've already got there the
DNA tech that allows us to have a huge
variety of different faces and we need
to match that in audio somehow but the
tech just isn't quite there yet Google
are probably the only company in the
world that has enough data to actually
synthesize in a realistic way any voices
but we will keep an eye on it and we
will consider it any you know if at some
point it becomes feasible for us let's
see okay is there been any progress on
how sounds will change over distance in
different environments such as the sound
of a gunshot being fired from the
perspective of the person firing who is
at the top of a canyon or some of this
right now so first of the sound of the
target would hear it was shot down
inside the canyon yeah this ties in to
the propagation tech that I was talking
about before so in that instance once
this tech is ready that sound will pick
up the effects as it travels so the
sound happening on the top of a canyon
will pick up appropriate reflections for
that area and then it will travel down
into the bottom of the canyon and it
will have those effects applied as well
so if you hear it when you stood next to
it you're going to pretty much hear just
the sound of it on the top but if you
have the listener down in the canyon
you're gonna hear the accumulated
effects of that sound traveling ships
are getting new carpet display systems
they're probably talking about the new
annunciator panel stuff like that are
you doing are we what are we doing to
prove the ship sound effects for inside
the conference as well to match the
visuals well for this one we actually
reached out to community in the speaking
to an engineer from the Australian Air
Force yeah and now but that was meows
catfishing oh yeah it was not you let
your Australian accent is also on point
I'm and yeah we taught for like over an
hour about the warning systems or audio
systems you get in aircraft and stuff
like that and historically we started to
try and design a UI sound for every
different type of UI notification you
can get in a ship like missiles locked
on to you you're locked in someone
else's enemies nearby all that kind of
stuff um and it becomes like a language
that you have to learn and if we change
that per manufacturer and per ship then
you've always got a real learn its
language and in in real life the
aircraft have a very limited amount of
audio warnings is like major all the way
at major so minor 102 watch it and they
Basie and that's where the non-si air
power comes in it's like hey something
critical you look down and then visually
it tells you what the actual specific
issue is so with the introduction of the
enunciate plans it allows us to to clear
that up and come with a very clear
intuitive sound design to support that
yeah I chat is asking about poop sound
effects so we're going back to the
thread will it be possible to disable
enable some of the ships speech messages
and/or used custom wav files for events
like I can incoming missile what do you
think like like people replacing the
soundscape for the ship with custom
stuff so we only did that with the the
jukebox where the players could drop in
their own yeah you could drop your own
music in yeah and we don't offer that as
a minute with ship speech we do I'm
fairly sure you can choose the level of
verbosity verbosity on the ship's B so
maybe we can offer more options there
yeah but yeah in terms of custom wire
files that's not something we're
considering right now but we never ruin
hanging out surround sound is and has
been very bigger and star citizen for a
long time now to this person center
channel is very muted and the
directionality of sound isn't it all
there
what's wrong with starts that is to
surround support and then they there's
just a string of expletives here I won't
read those long in showbiz yes so I we
were developing a big focus on
headphones and stereo and there wasn't
too many considerations for testing and
designing stuff for surround discreetly
but recently there's a bigger focus on
that we've got a stuff stuff with
adhesive the 5.1 room with some really
nice speakers and it's something where
we're aware of the community is talking
about it so now when we're testing
things were highly acute of how things
translate from from stereo and in 5-1 or
because they are poorly rendered wise or
scale up to whatever playback system
you've got within reason right there's
only so many configurations of those we
can test but it's absolutely something
we're aware of now you're talking about
the new Apollo Apollo room yeah yeah
actually that was actually wrong where
we thumbed yeah ever I see acronyms man
do we have any intention to allow people
to communicate with others outside of
the game for example people that are
sitting on spectrum we've talked about
the ability that is before making voice
compatible with spectrum so that you
could talk to people like okay what are
you doing it's like I'm traveling here
is whatever the oh okay well the hold on
let me pretend not to work and then you
jump in the game I think oh we've talked
about chap communication between game
and that what about voice chat I don't
know Graham you're the voice dude
well just off the top of my head
our boy tech is detached from game
servers and detached from the game in
such a way that that wouldn't be
impossible it's certainly not our main
focus right now because we want to make
sure the VoIP experiencing game is as
good as it possibly can be and you know
that's why a lot of the focus has been
on making it die jet
making all the effects work within the
game but is certainly something that
would be technologically possible and
also I think it would add something to
the game if we were to do that because
you could effectively kind of you could
have someone who's sat at a home playing
in the game and someone else who's got
the spectrum app on their phone and they
could literally ice out on the train
coming home from work and they could
literally call each other I think that
will be amazing so I think we should a
bro my all's are yeah I'm a Manchester
sender yeah I'm in the trade station
I'll be there
surely I mean you could essentially do
that with third-party apps like discord
now so it's one of those things when it
comes to prioritizing it's do you
prioritize something that is already
available through a third party
something or do you prioritize things
that are uniquely star citizen is
imagined as a difficult consideration
yeah I think in order for us to we need
to be competitive with discord in order
for people to use our voice solution
because they've they've got the option
of just switching it off and using
discord so you know obviously we have to
consider those options if we want to be
truly competitive the next question from
chat is another one that comes up every
time we do one of these audio shows
bouncing out that one voice attack the
possibility of doing our own voice
activated commands mm-hmm have we made
any progress and then further
considerations on that at this point
there has been some initial
investigation into what tech would be
required because this is star citizen we
wouldn't want it to be anything but the
best implementation a voice attack that
it could be so there's a heck of a lot
of work to get through before we can
actually offer that in game but it is
certainly something that's always been
on chris Roberts wishlist and it remains
in our backlog and at some point we will
get around to it question from the chat
said do you consider discrete audio
components an essential aspect of star
citizen and III don't know if they're
talking about like but like people spend
a lot of time you know you know building
up CPUs and RAM and video cards and
anything do you do would you consider
have
high-end audio equipment a compulsory
thank for it to play star citizen Oh is
like an audio interface and all yeah for
the playback experience yeah I'm
guessing that's what they mean there
yeah I honestly would say no I would say
if you've got a working audio system and
a good set of speakers and headphones we
need if you're gonna spend the money
that's where I'd spend it on in the
output medium generally you know sound
cards or sound cards and they if they
work they work and that's good enough
and it's our job to make it sound good
on the like very low-end stuff as well
it should be a great experience and
about water playback system is right
yeah we'd like we've got recommended
minimum spec and spends like ten
thousand pounds on some studio monitors
then we're sweet right no these leaders
sound good all night you know why the
lot of check logitech speakers or
anything like that of the speakers are
available or headphones so I have to
make sure that we cater to that so he's
asking about the ship voices know how
many ship voices do we have in game
right now how many different ship voices
oh I don't know that's more of a
question for Bob he's a dialogue lead
but it's one per manufacturer so however
many from manufacturers we have and that
goes down to like consolidated Outland
and Argo whoo and we have like a couple
ships there they have their own yeah
well everyone every money [ __ ] poorly
should have yeah the questions about a
comment that was made a long time ago
about the possibility of switching those
out basically like say you really prefer
the Drake [ __ ] and Betty mm-hmm but you
really want to fly your your
consolidated Outland ship mm-hmm have we
because where are we at with the any
consideration towards being able to swap
those well we could make it possible if
we investigate into it rather than tying
it to the ship it'd be like a a profile
attached to the player kind of thing my
ship component yeah yeah yeah we've got
that we have the assets I'm sure we can
build the technology to be able to swap
out based on the question player but
nothing would be investigated at the
moment
nope yeah there's like voice box can you
feel it's not enough and I get off fader
and joses the thing I've always thought
the best a GPS voice we've been Gilbert
Godfried because imagine him yelling at
you when you when you miss your turn
boy and bless you to be awesome alone
yeah small you microphone before you say
that question is actually it's too
similar to it's about the do you plan
the density of the atmosphere and
compositional influence how things will
sound us that's just like we had before
yeah
are you planning to change the sound
signature kuan drives for each different
model quantum drive we're already seeing
some different visual effects with that
required drives from different the bunny
like how much differentiation do we want
in the sound well if it's if it looks
drastically different more and supports
it and if there's different
manufacturers and different lore and all
that kind of stuff then while trying to
pull it in line with what the law says
and but recently we we've updated that
et sounds because we we hadn't properly
supported shorter QT jumps because of
all these like slingshot jumps and stuff
like that so we've rewrote that to make
it sound a bit better and but yeah if it
actually is different in the game then
we'll support it and give it a different
sound for the folks that are asking UI
questions those are for the UI team and
not for the C I'm gonna ask this
question mm-hmm cuz I'm curious what
your answer is
what's up with the garbled intercom
public announcement messages and all
those are who wants to take that one I
deny that so we'll talk about it
something mysterious seems to be
happening that's all we know everybody
seems like it's related to something
though yeah nobody willing to put the
job on the line don't put me in that
situation there is okay
that's the path I'm something cool let's
see how do you silence a laser this is
for question two there yeah what you do
is you take something is it inherently
styling anyway sound cool and then the
there's a feature request support
silence tears on energy weapons there we
go okay why do these silences cuz you
made them sound loud right but yeah
you've got ballistic weapons got energy
weapons needs it sound cool and stuff
like that and for gameplay reasons if
you need it you've silenced one you use
BOTS answers on the other and stuff like
that so you know if we had how think
would be fun if you had energy weapons
that were completely silent you've been
walking around and then just headshot
down at the old counter-strike days
where you just don't have a chance and
so basically you need needs it sound
cool and then we need for gameplay
mechanics need to put silencers on them
and make them sound silent so we look
cool I've got the bet I got the fault of
that how can we hear sounds in a vacuum
I'm just gonna well what we want is to
create a cool thing right and you have a
rule of cool like Star Wars cinematic
stand in space but you've all got the
full spectrum of like also game dance
like the the film gravity where's all
that contact stuff there's no sound
propagation in space so we got to make a
game that's fun and but what we're
playing with at the moment is the
concept of sound simulation so there's
already current technology there's a
great TED talk where they've got this
high speed high frame rate camera and
they can they filmed a leaf
there's no microphones on it and next to
the leaf out the shot was a loud speaker
playing mary had a little lamb and
there's an algorithm that they run this
footage through and they can recreate
the sounds from the vibrations that they
filmed on the leaf which is awesome so
we thought that's some great in law like
explanations for why we can hear sound
in space so a plane with the idea of
having this sound simulation unit
component in your ship it all unwise
light waves and vibrations and then play
back what you would
sound like in a pressurized environment
so that's how we can justify hearing
sounds in space boy it also gives us the
ability to say like okay well that's
half the full spectrum that's not a cake
and eat it too so that's how the gravity
asked sound arrangement and the full
Star Wars stuff so you're flying around
space bars all cool you can hear
everything you know where everything is
behind you all that kind of stuff and
then you get a impede and they look so
cool and then you just all you hear is
your ship and you see all the stuff
going on the actually you can't hear it
and that's terrifying so again it makes
you feel really like isolated alone and
vulnerable because all you're hearing is
your ship just creaking you're this husk
and so all you stuff powers up and you
get that a sense back again so that's
how we kind of justify it yeah we got to
play it so we can take it away
interesting gameplay reason CR has been
known you know over the years to say
something along the lines of you know we
take things to the point of realism
mm-hmm then we bring them back to the
point of fun mm-hmm you know it's at the
end of the day you know it
video games are an entertainment medium
they're meant to provide us an
entertaining experience and yeah going
through the entire game in muted silence
would be pretty tedious but giving it to
you you just said a few minutes of
giving it to you so that we can take it
away at key moments though is that it
aspired as an inspired choice and I like
that a lot all right
will there be sound bleed through walls
again this comes back to the propagation
work that I was talking about earlier so
the plan will be that if there's a an
open path for a sound to travel to you
you will hear it through that path but
if the doors are all closed you probably
will want to hear it sort of muffled
bleeding through the wall it's a tech
that I don't have working yet but it's
definitely on the plan so yes though
will there I've said it
what could imagine is that scene from
The Shining was the blood pouring I
elevates it with sound bleeding through
the walls but yeah yeah once I had a lot
more like positional detail and like
kind of you know confidence for the
players in you know localizing where
someone else is near them
you know kind of thing yeah much like an
omission my FPS machine video coughs not
being in here
yeah people in the next room get my room
but through the pole through the doorway
over yeah it'd be really good
interesting question from the chat gran
were you aware of anything like
ray-tracing which is all the rage right
now yeah prevent but for sound yeah I
mean it can be done you can you can
retrace and pick up you can read trace
and pick up the materials from the
reflections and you can figure out sort
of what effect those materials should
have you know a bumpy material should
make the sound more diffuse or as a
solid reflective surface would do
exactly what it expected we may be very
reflective in terms of audio as well but
that's the kind of thing like in the
audio team tech like that would always
be something that hangs off the visual
tech so really we gotta have the ray
tracing on the visuals before we can
think about having it on the audio so
that's where we are one of the questions
do you plan to add a mixer audio mixer
so that we can balance our own audio
features by basically breaking down a
bit break banging down on the discreet
audio options so that people can adjust
their own mix I'm against the idea I
think if we were to give you say like an
ambience lighter a Foley slider weapon
volume slider and all that stuff then
they would allow people to get a
competitive advantage over the people by
just you know turning down the ambience
boosting the Foley boosting the weapons
and turning about everything else
yeah and importantly making the game
sound terrible in favor of those trying
to get a contest
no I just think if we've done our job
properly and you know we've created a
really really good mix then people who
won't have any need for that in the
first place so we have toyed with the
idea of having sound profiles that like
saying I'm not the cruise ship based on
role and stuff like that so if your
pilot you'll hear a certain set of a
certain mix if you're an engineer but
you're different you know just tailoring
the sound experience to whatever the
role is if you're in a seat and stuff
like that well giving them given the
back is on players at full control over
the mix may not be the best way what
what's that affected you have to spend
the most time getting just ready
what's your LWOP oh what's your white
whale what's the sound effect that
nearly killed you the Bonnie defender
yeah yeah that's quite a while yeah just
yeah because we've never made a bunny
ship before and there was nothing to go
up there's no previous work to look
under all right that's that's how it
that's the ballpark of what this one
should sound like it huh takane oh yeah
come up with from scratch so we did like
a design spec brief yeah you know
they're tribal cheap you'll arrive
you're understaffed
yes first apartment live and all stuff
is prepared for alien yeah it's not like
property it's not normal thrusters and
it's likeéoh exactly its proper alien
yeah you did a great job
there's not one you know one moving part
wasn't there and I was just like one
week of like Tara have been like can I
come in am I am ia good sound is that
can I do this how do you how do you make
some of this never been made before
what do you reference this has no
reference yeah we talked a little bit
about that it didn't quite make it in
the episode but in the interviews we
talked about that that sometimes the
hardest thing is the complete unknown
it's it's it's being being suffocated by
possibilities
yes no there's a great phrase the iOS
refer back
- and it's if you if you go if you get
given a completely clean slate do
anything you want it's being paralyzed
by the possibility of infinity so if you
sit there you can blue sky thing you can
do anything you want you go where do I
start where do I begin
but if you're giving like some
restrictions you can find creativity in
their adversity breeds creativity
absolutely when I first joined the
company the Audion doctor at the time
was like right got this mobile glass
system and we need I could fall UI sweet
and now with the UI stuff it's like it's
like a language like positive negative
good bad you know happy sad kind of
stuff and tracking movement and I was
like man I suck at you I like don't make
me do design go back exactly why you
should do it and I was like right so
it's playing with loads of sin so making
it sound or sci-fi and swishing and
stuff was like now that sucks and what I
did it was called Moby glass so I
thought as well clever and got loads of
sample libraries of like glass breaking
cracking like screech and all that kind
of stuff I said I'm gonna use this as my
source and only that to generate all my
my sound effects further Moby glance and
I got some really good results for the
first pass and stuff and I took it's a
lot of directing it's like yeah that's
great it's just you got all these
frequencies in there you don't need for
you I am oh okay then Rebecca nice pen
probably two weeks solid just doing this
UI system it said all right it's not
about you I'm doing later I started for
the that's what I did for the van to
defend it was like when I realized I was
struggling just kind of sat and found a
bunch of sounds that I thought were
obvious it and like all in the same
ballpark the same kind of aesthetic and
then put them in a folder and I might
have got to do this just with these yeah
like the odd exception where like so
actually so when you're given a fairly
wide open task that the thing that work
best for you was actually to constrain
yourself when you when you're when
you're forced into constrictions and and
working within what's possible and so
that you get Star Wars when you can make
anything that you want with with no
limits you get been a menace
yeah pressure makes diamonds right yeah
well I mean I cover the answer that one
because I don't I don't make sounds I
just make sounds happen so was there
anything one in you
make happen you beat your head against
it well yeah I guess there's you know
sometimes we get asked to create effects
and one of them recently was we're gonna
be doing a distress call thing I think
and then the idea was to make that
distort in a new and interesting way
that kind of reflects that it's
difficult to reach and this kind of
thing so that was a fairly open task but
then you know having said that there's
only so many ways you can distort a
sound so but just I just make them all
available players like rubber band
design something that we're like you
write as a plugin no plugins that we all
buy and use you just wait for I'm sure
gross we should take it's much cheaper
just to write once have you had a quick
question repeat it I lost it it just
passed by too much well voice modulators
for like bounty hunters or criminals
people who want to disguise their voices
in the game good thing mm-hmm
well we can like push for an unlock
where we just get the players go
it's really and but that was I would tie
into the like voice propagation stuff I
bands it enemies avoid feature
potentially and I think it would be a
very interesting one to implement and so
you know because I find it interested as
a task I'll probably do it but I just
thought the point on that you know the
one they do in all the movies where they
put a cloth over the telephone that
doesn't work at all all those blackmail
calls you will there be different sound
zones and big ships with sounds changing
depending on how close or far away you
are from certain systems that's
basically yeah you already do that right
not point to a point yeah yeah like we
have the ambience and the ambience of
the ship like so not not the movement
sounds not the thruster sounds they're
kind of built up in layers of like a
kind of dead ambience for the room and
then like
kind of distant details and then really
close up details but when we have sound
on each component and stuff that will be
yeah like they'll be like the kind of
rough vibe of that component being in
the room and then as you get closer to
the actual thing then you'll hear all
the kind of details of it all that also
ties into the plans to have like
different mixes per room for each kind
of roll and like a multi cruise ship so
yeah they'll be like different sounds if
you're in the engineering room there's
will be a certain set of things that you
need to know about as the engineer that
the pilot doesn't need to know about
that the turret gunner doesn't need to
know about this kind of stuff
we're also tying it together with saying
like the load and offload of like the
thrusters and engine power plants and
stuff how if you're if you go full
throttle
then all the ambiences and tones can
change slightly based on the load on the
ship and stuff like that so you can mean
the bridge by giving it full throttle
and then the guy in engineering would
hear all this stuff changing it in in
relationship to the throttle and stuff
also if submitting your question on caps
and I am I gonna read it I see so many
caps it just goes right on by guys why
is there a little bit no warning I'm
being locked on and fired at such as
alarms the sound of bullets flying past
the ship help me I get shot a lot I need
help maybe pilot better throw now again
looking the introduction of the
annunciator panel and stuff were looking
to really clean that up because a lot of
those UI notifications are really legacy
and we just we transfer when we moved
from F mod to wise a lot of them were in
place there and I designed some of them
there's one that sounds like a squealing
pigs like we people hate it it's still
in there and but yeah so a lot of those
UI sounds are legacy and we'll get
around to them but the trouble is we're
constantly adding features and abilities
to ships and stuff like that so when we
when you can need a finite set of
everything we need to support and we
strip it back down to the major moderate
and minor kind of warning stuff then it
would be a lot more lot not cleaner I
think one of the problems of the
there's too many different sounds you
know norm learn the language of it
curses like 12 different there's a
different completely different sound for
every different yeah I think that goes
wrong
yeah like simplifying that down so yeah
like you don't really need a look at
this but it's happening kind of thing
like you should look at this and
something really bad has happened and
following that with really a really
quick voice a voice message yeah that's
a really good points we got a dialogue
assets to convey messages buy the [ __ ]
from waslley of what the situation is
we've also got the UI notifications of
what the hoods telling you is happening
and then we've also got the sound
effects of what's happening and stuff
like that and sometimes they're all
stepping over each other and some
dialogue assets you know that's you long
for the the action like proximity
warnings like danger you're about to
crash into something on the left and
then you've already done it kind of
things so just deciding what needs voice
what needs sound effects and what needs
UI and you know they're like diegetic
warnings like you're getting shot at and
stuff or something that we're constantly
changing the mix of and trying to get
right like you know for like you know
the sound of bullet whizzing by the ship
and the sound of impacts and stuff like
how loud should they be how loud should
friendly ships be or near you versus
enemy one zone like should the one that
you're targeting be louder or the one
that's targeting you be louder and all
this kind of stuff like we're constantly
trying to find the sweet spot with that
yeah we are pushing to improve that
whole experience as a pilot in a ship in
star citizen because you know for a long
time we're we a lot of the time we find
ourselves supporting every single
feature and then moving on to the next
feature and and now there's a bit of a
push to look at that experience as a
whole and improve it and make it much
better gameplay experience does that
extender things like the the breathing
sounds notice sometimes when I'm just
you know just flying I'm on combat I'm
just you just fly on my way I'm in a
green zone yet not a care in the world
and my characters having an asthma
attack your character has asthma that's
well I have yes so when you when you
hear breathing you actually hear
me so that's all those breeding assets
all recorded by myself that's right they
were amount of times they threw up or
passed out recording that yeah so a
fundamentally right now we've got to
breathing sets style sets sweets to
breathing sweets we've got normal
default which is like fps evn stuff then
we've also got piloting and the piloting
set has its own set of logic and the
main thing that really drives it up and
down our that faster or slower breathing
is g-force and stuff like that hmm
so if they changed the flight model or
you make some ships faster and others
basic I've got one breathing sweet honey
too because it's not systemic yeah and
so like you know can you how many G's
can you pull and stuff so like I think I
had to nerf it a bit because we're just
driving away to quit when the new flight
model came out we have to quickly
quickly adjust it because the character
was just freaking out all the color AGA
AGSM so anti g-force training maneuver
and you'd love to in takeoff yeah it's
constantly being tuned and dialed in and
stuff and then just brought down in
volume because it I thought was really
cool and my infuriating and stuff bring
the breathing up a little bit just to
give you that kind of isolationist feel
like you really vulnerable the stuff but
yeah we didn't know if it was gonna work
out very well because you're the player
right I am playing the game and II don't
want the sound of someone breathing for
you it's like when I've been the voice
stuff you want you want to talk in the
game if you have like emotes where a
dolla boy is playing for your character
and calcium disconnect there and we
didn't know if it was gonna work or not
but actually turned out to be a pretty
useful feedback mechanism just got this
terrible idea of like during character
creation having to sit there record a
bunch of a bunch of character sounds as
if our character creation sounds strange
more see everybody record their own
strange sounds now we've actually shared
before that you did that you did the the
actor feature voices sound sound effects
for the for the male model yeah we
haven't shows that you also did the
female I didn't do the female model bugs
that we had the male breathing set for a
while and I we got some female audios
female staff - are there plans for the
sounds of canopy impacts such as debris
rattling against the glass or whatever I
get an asteroid field there's no way
that you have to already have that that
might be a sign it's too quiet yeah yeah
I mean yeah we really have we have that
now for when you blow up when their
ships been blowing off we have like a
zone like extends from the point of the
explosion and if you find yourself in
your ship in our zone then you get
debris impacts depending on how long it
was since the like how dense the debris
would be at that point basically we
could have extend that to like random
ones in the middle of an asteroid field
and all that kind of stuff we're ship
hasn't blown up yet no that would be
cool to have well there's two cap
considerations that either we can tie
into was actually how many in the game
is is there any particles over the
effects are impacting with the ship or
do we just imply that you know explosion
goes off when an asteroid field those
conditions are true plane debris can
sound so yeah I think I've become poorer
on them every particle there's like
interest intersection with a ship and
stuff I'll just be I'll be notes now I I
know that the three of you don't
necessarily work with the music but does
the music ever affect sound design like
do you ever do one thing and then when
you hear the music come in like oh
that's the music that the procedural
systems gonna play during this like oh
maybe we want something that it's more
in line with that do you it's where you
go does the tail wag the dog I'm guess
is what I'm asking
you've got two different types of meat
you've got digesting and non-diegetic so
diegetic is
like in the location like radio or PA
system stuff like that so that would be
affected propagation or like in a stuff
you shoot a speaker or it'll destroy and
stuff but then you've got the score we
just kind of got music non digest it now
they don't really into like one would
have really caused another one to
trigger necessarily but music
dynamically switch is based on the
intensity all that kind of stuff and the
main way they interact is probably more
with a mix so what you can do is
dynamically meter the frequency spectrum
of the sound effects and if you deem
that sound effects be more important you
can bring down those frequencies in the
music so you can own carving out
frequencies in the music to allow the
sound design to poke through or
conversely you can have it all the way
around so if you are certain frequencies
in the music you want to emphasize you
can bring down their sound effects to
accommodate that I think we also have to
be careful that overly tonal sound
design as well sometimes like you know
if like there's the cinematic music for
coming down to a certain planet and you
know you happen to do the background
planetary ambience without plumb it with
a slight tonal element that is like half
a step below the key of the musical or
less than half a standard sound a bit
funky I want to do a dramatic
reenactment of how I imagined this
backyard is asking this question this is
a question from piss-poor Pete says why
why did you say just make the larval
tram door opening noise so similar to
the sound of a grenade dropping in
counter-strike it scares me every time
when opinions of Phil Pierre Smallwood
do not represent those of clarify Robert
space industries or its subsidiaries I
got you toast
I mean it yes who did the Laura Beltran
door opening you call it if it's the one
I'm thinking of I think it was Barney
Barney yeah apparently these all weapons
there is like everything there's a
gunshot that Archie used loads of gun
mech sounds for all the mechanisms and
stuff I think minigun for that need to
get a gig for the doors tracking is that
a speaking of the tram door sounds why
don't they play a little chime before
they're about to close so that people
know when they're running as close to 12
minutes
we should watch the video I was on
intuitive designers liked about
accessibility for the people who are
visually impaired and it was how audio
can assist people in the real world and
it was talking about elevators so you
know the bombs you get if it's one bong
it's good the elevators going up or down
or two bongs yet the other way the other
way so you can get an elevator not be
able to see and you'll know which way
the elevator is traveling yeah that was
awesome so bringing those cow elements
into the game would be great what are
three bombs that we have on some elevate
so we could have the bombs on the door x
variable I think it's always different
so plug on the question for this shot
elevator music
[Music]
please hold we absolutely it's not the
highest priority we got all the know
it's like I said we need arrived all
these new locations coming online it's
like you're spending a lot of time in
the elevators you should probably miss
him quite a lot of game there get out
get out
it's true okay thank you back we
absolutely do there was a time when
elevators were the number one killers of
star citizens everywhere
no I actually true story Pedro once
asked me if I'd be willing to sing for
elevator music really I said yeah sure
but if I said I need something in the
style of Girl From Ipanema and he he got
actual work with workers - yes nice to
have and why not - you have to focus on
right now the task still exists probably
yeah running around a big ship can be
exciting especially if running into dark
of shady quarters how do you make these
kinds of areas feel rusty creepy little
places Josh yeah we just just kind of
spent we spend a lot of time in in the
level kind of getting a feel for it and
thinking of like what the player should
feel when they're in those kind of
environments um guess it's just a lot of
us it's rylynn everybody kind of this
yeah that you you know try something out
and then go through the whole process of
walking around the ship and you know
going from one place to another and
seeing if that feels right and yeah it
was a basic concept for say a space a
room a corridor Journal and you would
dress each corner with an audio trigger
spot and then have one in the center or
like an audio area ambience it's got a
bed ambience and they each kind of
corner would sound slightly different
and you basically static the way it
looks you know and even save even
support the same sound in each corner
right and but this sides dark you could
pitch it down a little bit and just I
you know guide the players subconscious
on
I'm this company and you're gonna head
something cool over here we'll have
something trigger every like you know 10
seconds or something and there's what's
really cool about her means is you can
apply imply stuff that's behind the
walls everything yeah I'm so if I if
you're walking down this like its
corridor corridors Josh I'm this like
pipes in stuff I thought you can just
allude to stuff being on the other side
earlier if it's like habitation someone
have an argument but you know in the hop
next door to you in stuff like that
Toronto we answered that question
earlier in the show you we only catch it
on the replay either here on Twitch or
on you do Koval have been asking to the
show now that this is a design question
it's a thing for shift is like ship
design it's not for you guys but I want
to get your opinion on on whether you'd
like to see it some of people have been
asking about the ability to have
shipboard megaphones so like project
sound out like I've been pulled over by
the cops hey go over right now you know
that's an awesome idea I'm gonna go back
and create the task straight after this
finishes because that I would play with
that how would it properly the space
Graham
well you know that's no yeah that's a
question we can overcome later isn't it
let's concentrate on the ship horns as
well somebody was asking for horns I
made me been in the question thread they
want to solve and then there should be a
bunch of different ringtones we should
sell them right so yeah I saw a video
recently of somebody approaching a few
guys who were on a planet and they were
flying down towards them and they were
trying to speak to them but they didn't
have a mechanism for that and I think
this of ship loudspeaker thing is a
really good idea yeah yeah we're like
tahno system in ships anyway don't we so
it's not too far away from that yeah
yeah I just want I don't want to be able
to pull up in my and my drake Cutlass
and hit a button in la Cucaracha
[Music]
RocketBallz should just take your on the
sky let's see we are almost at a time
gentlemen why do the helmet notification
sounds sound like air escaping from my
spacesuit now why do they last five
seconds why not just a simple Dame or
beep but n people getting confuse of
elevators one thinks oh no I don't know
I don't know which which none of it that
one is you guys then yeah it's just the
generic visor notifications yeah I don't
well tastes probably that long to match
the visual yeah if it sounds like air
escape analysis it needs to be sorted so
everything whoever sent that in does
like put a post up on the spectrum of
all our people take a look at it can you
list any ongoing issues that you're
focused on fixing in the short to medium
term well we all have bug lists that
we're working our way through and you
know if you find bugs while you're
playing please report them yeah we're
just we have a certainly in my case a
rather large list of issues that I'm
working through and to list them would
certainly use it a lot more than the
time we have left
yeah but I mean you know I've talked a
little bit about the the propagation
system that I'm working on and I think
that is a big issue that the game
suffers from right now is that audio
doesn't propagate properly so if that's
something that we talk about brings back
like yeah I this this goes along a lot
of these questions had to do with sound
propagation and atmosphere yeah it's it
seems to be a thing that has captured
the imagination of our backers with a
sound of damaged ships think missing a
wing or a hull breach or whatever create
different sounds flying through
atmospheres like whistling noises they
already do like they get more rattling
and more vibration II and
the health level changes the sound of
the foots and stuff but you know
implying some sort of like hull breach
or that kind of thing
be really cool like me here like it
whistling behind a panel where they used
to be a wing but now it's just open to
open to the air because the damage
system is quite dynamic different bits
can come up it's not like you get 25%
damage and you lose a wing
yeah afternoon we in audio don't like
you know there's no I don't know what's
going we just know like it's not at full
health wait if there are like like here
are items like wings there are something
that changes the fundamental
aerodynamics of the ship if we could tie
into whatever values that the wing is
now gone equals treatment thing then we
can start introducing audio specifically
and they'll be like feedback the
degradation stuff like hey your your
your ship sounds like it's batted oh
that's the sound of my wing that's gone
so you can learn the whistles or the
rouse and stuff like that be cool it so
it's all stuff we wanna do yeah damage
really I saved you like 95 percent
damage and you trying to come in get air
table as if weather the turbulence
itself would start damaging the ship my
trick and wings are so that'd be cool
you cannot enter atmosphere no no just
get it close to that you're on chance
rather to Monday we can do this alright
with that we're gonna stop the show
before he creates any more work for you
guys thank you so much for taking your
time to be here on the show this week um
Josh Phil and Graham Graham you stay
later and see how K we're gonna talk
about your background okay guys we've
got one more episode of inside star
citizen next week before
citizencon which is just two weeks away
from from from tomorrow we're not
feeling the pressure at all wait just
let me go do all right do I need to be
there so for starters in life I'm Jared
that's Phil that's Josh that's Graham
that's his backlog
you
