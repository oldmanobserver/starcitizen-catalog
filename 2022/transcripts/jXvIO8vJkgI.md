## Transcript

hello everybody Welcome to Star Citizen
live persistent entity streaming I'm
your host Jared Huckabee and if you've
never seen Star Citizen live before it's
the where we take about an hour out of
the end of our week and we chat with our
developers uh sometimes we take a look
at what they're working on have them
demonstrate some live process for us
other times we hold their feet to the
fire and make them answer the questions
from you the Star Citizen Community and
this week we are going to watch Benoit
and Paul's macrame art for the next hour
it's the art it's the art show I'm sorry
sorry
I've been practicing all month guys I'm
ready for this so uh about a week and a
half ago we posted a thread up on
spectrum and we collect we we collect we
collected
we collected a bunch of questions that
the community had about uh one of the
biggest kind of tent pole kind of name
recognition features coming to Star
Citizen in the upcoming Alpha 318
persistent entity streaming and so we're
going to talk about that today what it
is what it isn't uh what it does what it
doesn't and so forth and before we get
into it allow me to introduce uh the man
who probably needs no introduction but
we're gonna do it anyway uh uh CEO and
founder of turbulent our partners inter
Benoit
yeah hey everybody I'm the same guy yeah
CTO though CEO would be great that's
right that's right yeah CEO would be
great I'm gonna get a message from Mark
right now oh there he is exactly there's
the three dots from Mark oh there we go
uh and and then and then uh someone you
might recognize from last year's
citizengon presentation on persistence
and server meshing uh Mr Paul Randall
hey guys how you doing Paul good we
don't get to do many videos the last
time we were together was when we were
filming that that citizen gun thing
that's true almost all all alone in the
office everyone was still working I was
thinking about it it was almost exactly
a year ago as I'm looking at the date
right now so so it was painful to do
that alone right like the of filming all
those segments on the side like it was
difficult the graphics were nice though
yeah the graphics were nice yeah the
graphics were nice once they were done
they were up yes of course yeah no you
know all right so uh right off the bat
we we we we we we vamped for three
minutes uh let's start let's talk about
Precision in your streaming before we
get into the questions let's just start
let's set the table
what is persistent energy streaming now
I know we just did the ISE segment to
three weeks ago and whatnot but
everybody watches different things and
whenever now we got Paul we got Paul's
answer to the question so actually we
had Ben y answer it last time so Paul
I'm going to point this one to you
what is persistent entity streaming
well plus it's an anti-distrieving is
basically taking the entire scene graph
of the engine which is the entire
hierarchy of the universe players all
objects and take that which was
previously stored on and at most game
engine that's stored in the memory of
the server
or on the client we take all of that
and we push it to a database and it
gives us the foundation to basically
stream the entire entities hierarchy to
client servers and to persist so that
means we can shut down all the processes
and we can continue where we left off
so it's basically taking this entire
chunk of of state of the universe and
pushing it to a persistent database
you used a word I was really happy you
used Foundation uh the way I the way I
see Precision ended streaming it's a new
foundation for everything that comes
from Star Citizen comes to Star Citizen
from this point forward uh when when
we've had we've had to discuss
internally and I've explained to other
folks you know what this is in 318 the
best analogy I found is it's if you
imagine Star Citizen All-Star citizen is
a giant skyscraper it's like lifting the
skyscraper up 150 feet off the ground
digging out the old Foundation pouring
in a brand new foundation and then
dropping the building back on top of it
and trying desperately not to spill and
knock everything over that's inside the
building while you do it I'm making sure
the doors still work yeah exactly and
it's that's a very good analogy because
if you look at it the entity system and
the the scene graph that's the
foundation of the engine right so
everything everything uses it touches
everything every every single game team
everything a a Game feature is touched
by this change so it's it is a very good
like a picture you're drawing there so
and uh to address some expectations that
the community may have had I we see we
see the different streaming talk shows
and the threads on spectrum and stuff
like this uh
while persistent energy streaming will
be again the thing that so many future
systems and new systems will be built on
for 318 the focus of this is mostly in
maintaining what came before converting
what came before and ensuring it works
with this new Foundation
yes pretty much okay like right now
right now I know one of the questions if
you want to jump a little bit into those
is uh when we talk about PS we talk
about the server and we talk about the
player chart I think that was one one
question and people asking okay what's
the difference between a server and a
shot
um and for now for this very first
version there is not a difference
between both because we still run one
server per shot
um we separate those two words because
eventually the shot will be much larger
than just one server once we get to
server meshing which will be in later
iterations that's when we have multiple
servers per shot but in this very first
iteration as you said we basically we we
took the foundation of the engine and we
replaced it with this new persistent
entity database we try to get add parvis
what's there right so that means we
basically take all the tech we already
have one server per shot um and we we
replace that with special entity stream
uh hungola in the chat says drink every
time someone says eventually don't do
that
if it's coffee you're good
exactly what you drink right stay
hydrated if you drink water then yeah
now as just to add to what Paul was
saying about the 318 version of PS
um you know being on a single server and
persisting the state of this right the
the I think the most major effect that
we'll see from that is over time on a
given server because uh items will
persist now right as a typically right
now when a server restarts
the the state of the world is sort of
lost other than your your ships and your
character which actually live outside of
that in the current version
when a server restarts everything else
is gone NPCs reset to their initial
spawn positions you know doors reset uh
you know the entire thing starts back up
to the designed initial state of the of
the game world uh so that's that's true
after a server crash that's true on a
brand new server that we're adding uh
and so this sort of Auto cleanup servers
also restart over time like with you
know some of them sometimes don't have
players left on them and then we restart
them to recycle their memory things like
this currently the state of these
servers are are lost right so what that
means is
the effect in in 318 will be that over
time you're you'll start seeing things
that persist across restarts right and
then so an old server will have a lot of
modifications right because all of that
stuff doesn't get necessarily cleaned up
by a restart I would I would I would add
though though with a person streaming
and our new shot database but also the
global database there's uh the added
benefit that every items you take from
your shot and put in your inventories
they persist in the exact State you take
them out of the shot so previously your
your persistent database was just an
external database it was very limited
just a list of items basically this
person streaming when you have a ship
and you load stuff into that chip and
you put that ship into your inventory
because you landed on a landing Zone and
it gets stowed into your lending Zone
inventory if you play on the next day
and you take that chip out of that
inventory it actually comes in the full
persistent State as we stowed it from
the from the shot so there will be there
will be uh things which which you will
notice which obviously weren't possible
without persistent entity stream but
again to stress on on Jared's Point like
right now we did all this foundational
work and now gamecode teams need to
adjust to those changes and there's a
lot of good stuff they can do now
um but we just integrated our big chunk
of work into our main branch
um
a couple months ago and now game code
teams just start to adding those
features so you can't expect just
because we have the core foundational
Tech ready and pushed to to our main
branch that all the game code teams
actually like take full full advantage
of all the new cool features um they can
do with it and we will go over those
points while we go over the questions I
would say so let's jump into we
basically just did we basically just
back doored into our first question
which is what is the difference between
a server and A Shard eventually it'll be
very different but for the time being it
is it is kind of a one-one thing uh you
know for 318 and and then until server
Mission comes in uh but before server
meshing which is ultimately where this
New Foundation is taking us uh is uh the
question is uh since PES is per server
then how do we get back onto the same
server that our items are on
well with the very very so the the first
part of the question is before server
matching uh is PS per server and as I
kind of touched on the on the previous
answer
um yes persistent anti-streaming is per
server but as you can take items out of
the server database into your Global
database and we made sure it's the same
exact database the same data structures
there will be more persistence so you
can take persistence from one server to
another server by putting items into
your inventory and then taking them out
of the inventory into a new into a new
server
um your second question is how do we get
back onto the same server
um for 3.18 we won't address any
matchmaking changes and it again comes
back to we want to get at pubs what we
have so far before we start to to adding
the new features also matchmaking
changes will be become a part of our
server meshing uh work which we will
start obviously right after personality
streaming hits so for for the very first
version of uh personal entity streaming
you will just use the same matchmaking
logic you have right now that means if
you start up your client you get
randomly matched to uh to a server
warshot I can use those terms
interchangeable at the moment because
they are pretty much the same thing
obviously it's the same as right now you
can play with your friends so you would
join the same instance if you crash out
of a game we reserve the slot of your
current chart so that means if you crash
out
you will be able to have I think it's 10
minutes
um to lock back in and get connected to
that chart so you can recover anything
and as I said earlier uh all items uh
which you take into your inventory uh
that's what you what you will keep with
you which you can bring to any chart so
that is your way to basically make sure
uh the stuff you want to really like
keep
um you can keep by just putting it into
your inventories
big differences between what stowed and
what's unstowed yes so let's talk some
we have a few more questions that are in
that vein the the stowing things versus
unstowing uh does PES allow entities to
persist across all servers or does it
only persist on the server that the item
was originally spawned on so this is
almost certainly you already answered
the question you store it you take it
with you this is about if I dump a can
what happens I can't does it get
replicated everywhere else is it how
does this work
so if you uh so depending on the type of
item and of course if if there's legal
ownership attached to it right you can
stow it and keep it and bring it with
you across shards right so that's the
first thing but for items even that you
legally own that you leave let's say I
have a gun that I already legally own
and I drop it somewhere in Port alisar
and then I stopped playing and then I
come back later and I get match made
into another Shard that gun is still in
the other chart it's it persists per
shard uh so everything that's in the
game world so unstowed items persist in
each server that they're on right that's
why there's a mechanism like Insurance
to get stuff back if something happens
that's what there's mechanism like
stowing so you can take them across
servers
um obviously
uh that's a bit of a downer in in
because we have a lot of shards right uh
for the moment but the the intent and
the goal from this foundational work is
that we're gonna get to our very large
shards and so uh and and with the
matchmaking changes that Paul entered on
related to matchmaking then we'll be
able to have Shard affinity and so the
gun that you left on Shard X your your
chance of getting back on chart X will
be extremely high but for the moment
it's not the case so everything that's
unstowed in the game World lives in that
server
um uh until it's reaped or until it's
destroyed or until it's cleaned up or
what there's many we're going to talk
about a lot of reasons why stuff would
go away from A Shard but yeah I think
it's important to I think we're going to
make this reminder periodically as I see
the chat and everything uh shards and
servers will be
different things they are they are
different things for 3 18.
they are it is one Shard per one server
so when we use those terms
interchangeably like that we are
speaking about the state of our very
next patch 318 so we're gonna one of the
we talked about this before the show one
of the confusing aspects of this
conversation and indeed why we're having
another hour-long conversation after the
20 minute thing I've been wanted I did
before is because we we have to discuss
both how this will be 319 320 321 4.0
whatever the numbers on don't read into
the numbers I'm just saying numbers
people uh how it will be in the future
versus how it will be in this very first
patch that includes it so so we're we're
going to bounce back and forth between
Talk of the future and where it's going
and talk of what this next first
iteration is so uh I
this is one of those things we're going
to have to rely on our wonderful
Community content creators out there to
follow the discussion follow the threads
and
we're gonna bet we're gonna be bouncing
back and forth that's the only way to
discuss this at this point
um so uh
so yeah so if I it will that coffee cup
or gun still be there for others to find
when the player placing it isn't online
so that thing that you don't own when I
log off does it disappear with me or
does it persist there and for how long
it stock cleanup
um well as as we hinted earlier
um if you take a coffee cup and you
unstow it or you drop it on the floor in
a shot it stays on that chart and it
stays there as long as we will talk
about the the cleanup process a bit
later but it will stay there basically
forever and everyone can go there and
pick it up
foreign
forever yeah that was one one confusion
I saw throughout the questions was the
like uh it's important to notice that
it's not like you log into the game
world and all of the items you've placed
in the world are now suddenly overlaid
in it no when you put something in one
world one Shard one server it's in that
server and and so whether you're online
or not at that moment right so the so
yeah that's the conf there's no if I log
off is my coffee cup I placed on Clio
still there yes doesn't matter if you're
online or not for that specific uh for
for items place in the game room uh I
think the the only the only expectation
the only uh exception to that is that
when you log out obviously your player
gets stowed back into into your player
inventory and if you do to a ship
padlock out your ship gets stowed
together with you into your ship into
your player inventory and that includes
items that are in the ship as well it's
always yes if we talk about stowing and
unstowing it's always the entire uh the
entire current state of that object
including everything which is you know I
talked about the scene graph and the
hierarchy earlier if you look at the
ship and all items placed inside the
ship you can imagine that it's like a
tree the hierarchical tree of items and
if you take the the top the root of the
tree and we put it into an inventory
everything which is under it follows it
so again looking at the chat right now
uh we're gonna we're gonna need to
reiterate I think we need to say this a
different way uh replication
yes is there replication in 318 if if I
throw something on the ground on server
14
you know it does it just stay on server
14 and only 14 and only exists on 14
until it's eventually cleaned up it does
not replicate to other servers it does
not replicate to other scores at the
moment the only
the only way you can bring something so
the first the first fundamental uh point
you have to understand is every single
item can only exist once right so you
can't have a copy of the same exact
instance of an item in multiple shots if
you have your ship and you bring it to
Shard a it is in chart a that chip can't
exist in a different chart and that's a
good reason for it if it would exist in
multiple charts what happen if in one
shot someone shoots the left wing off in
the other shot someone shoots the right
wing off right we can't we can't allow
that to happen so what that means is if
that ship is in a shot it's locked to
the shot it's it it is just part of that
instance if you take that chip and bring
it into your Global inventory that's
then your way to take this ship and
bring it with you to a different shot so
every every every shot in in this very
first iteration is its own isolated
instance basically and then drawing that
line
forward to server meshing server meshing
isn't about replication either server
meshing is about bringing all of these
things to all these uh servers together
in a mesh and it is it transitions it
doesn't work I mean if you talk about
replication I mean obviously if I talk
about replication I probably have a
different thing in my head because in
server meshing we do replicate objects
between different servers because
multiple servers will eventually
simulate the same shot right and
obviously in that case you might have
two servers and they replicate the same
object between each other for uh for
simulation reasons right so we don't be
like it could be that server a simulates
one area and so a b simulates another
area there's overlap in that overlap you
have objects in the Nova area replicated
to both servers right that's uh that's
why for me replication is a bit
different word but you can see a shot
again as it's Unique individual instance
there's no cross shot replication plant
we do once we talk about player bases
and so on we do have discussions with
design right now how we can do that for
like if if a player builds a base on a
planet for example uh we kind of want to
show that on all charts
um not just on the one shot the players
in but those discussion discussions are
still happening
I'm going to skip ahead on our list here
because the next couple questions are
all kind of Hit the same point but uh so
let's talk about a very typical scenario
that happens we're a game that's still
in development uh
you land on ship on a planet
and the server crashes at 30k uh if this
if you load back into a new server how
does the player find their ship at that
I find their Old Ship at this point
since it wasn't stowed properly it was
landed out
okay
um I don't know been well if you want to
take that yeah yeah sure so first of all
there's no 30 kids never happened
so uh using opinions expressed by Benoit
buses
right so uh the so in the case of so you
have a let's start from the beginning
you uh go to the Aesop terminal and you
unstow a ship so the ship lives is first
in your in your location inventory and
it's in the global DB
you uh
um request the ship shows up on the
lending bed that's that actually behind
the scenes unstows the ship so it moves
from the global database to The Shard
now you can you can now it's being
actively simulated by a game server and
so there's thousands of updates on it
right uh to keep it up to date in the DB
uh you go in it you start flying it out
um you put Cargo in it you drop some
items in it whatever
then
uh 30k happens right server ran out of
memory or you know something like this
happens uh now when you come back to the
game the that ship is still in that
Shard all right it's it's still
in the persisted database of Shard 24
for example and so if you come back and
your match made most likely going to be
match made on another server because
chart 24 is not available at the time
especially if you log in rapidly back in
when you enter your new Shard that ship
will not be available for sure right so
but it will be available for insurance
claims
uh what we are looking at at this moment
for this problem because we know that's
a problem obviously this is not cool
right it is that when a server crashes
well we have a dedicated recovery
mechanism that we're actually putting in
place right this moment we're working
actively on this right now
um throughout our current stability
testing which will Auto Stow back the
ship into your location inventory and so
what that means is uh we don't want you
to be stuck with your ship stuck in a
Shard that's no longer available right
you were actively playing with that ship
it's got cargo and we want you to be
able to grab it and so in the case of a
30k
your your ship would get out of stone
same as your player right because
there's no difference between a ship and
a player in this instance right so uh
that's the goal that we have for 318 is
to make sure that that case doesn't
happen so that in the case of a 30k your
ship is just stowed back in in the exact
state it was in at the moment of the
crash
um and so uh you keep your stuff right
that's the we don't want you to be you
know stuck with a ship that's
unavailable and then you need to find
The Shard again and it's in you know
that's like a guessing game so we don't
want you to be stuck in that exactly I
do want to add though that eventually
and that's a great feature of
Personality streaming if that server
30ks
um with specificity stream before
processing entity streaming that means
that this whole world would be dead
because the memory is gone everything is
gone with persistently streaming however
the shot and the state of the shot still
exist right the server crashed because
it ran out of memory or there was a game
code bug or whatever
um it's always game code Box by the way
yes it's never the core attack
um anyways when that happens we can
actually start up a new server and it
can load back that chart
and then continue simulation for exactly
where we left off again for 3.18 because
we don't want to address matchmaking
just yet
um we will do what Ben Rogers said where
we try to take locate all the ships and
we Stow them into your location
inventory so you don't lose your ship
and the progress on that chip however
the ultimate goal is that when a sharp
server crashes
um that we restart a new server for the
chart and that matchmaking will allow
your player to reconnect to that chart
and then matchmaking will be able to do
to resolve the slot for that exact chart
so when you start ultimately or not in
in a next iteration you will be able to
start your client and there will be a
little dialogue which is telling you do
you want to wait for your old chart to
come back online because obviously it
takes a couple of minutes before shot is
back online and then you will be able to
join back to exactly where we left off
and then eventually the final ago once
we have a complete the the server
matching and the replication layer and
the Gateway layers all separated at that
point when a server 30ks you won't even
notice you will still stay connected and
we start a new server or we have a fleet
of servers already running which can
take over that work right but that's
obviously far in the future so what we
what what we're saying is in this very
first version to be on Powers what we
have right now server crashes we take
player and we take the ships put them
all into your inventory so you don't
lose progression and you do and you will
get exact persistent State back from the
ship at the moment the server crash so
you don't lose anything
in the next version we then try to re
uh revive that chart and let you let
matchmaking allow you to come back to
that chart and then ultimately in the in
the final version it should be all
almost transparent to the player so what
you're saying is three versions and then
we're done
it's always just three words right yeah
we're always three versions away
um so uh this is a really a great
example chat went through a a roller
coaster of emotions there uh here
hearing the problem and and and and
hearing the struggle and then oh no and
then getting to what we're doing just to
solving like oh yeah you know it was
like fail and save almost this is a good
example of what the work for 318 is uh
318 is not about uh with regards to
percentage stream they're still
salvaging and the and the PTV race track
and New Rivers and there's all those new
things but for p-e-s-p-s is not about
unlocking new you know developments for
for 318 that will be 19 and so forth and
so forth and so on this is about
discovering all the things that break
because of this foundational change and
then developing new tools and new
methodologies like this Auto stove for
the player and the [ __ ] that you talked
about to get us back to what we had
before a a an experience similar to what
we had before with this brand new
Foundation that sits underneath
um you did say something else in there
that I want to follow up on right now
you say because we don't want to do
matchmaking right now
uh
why
well there's always there's always the
resource constraint right so the same
team who would probably work on
matchmaking is currently working on the
entity graph and it's also about risk if
we go and and
quite Frank 3.18 is a giant risk already
because so much new technology right we
have we're replacing a database which we
have built over the last five years
um and it it came to its limits in the
last couple of patches as we all I think
experienced
um but that is like five years of
development which you're now replacing
with complete brand new tech we have I
think it's at at that point probably
eight different like kinds of new
Services which we deploying
um we also at the same time switched our
underlying uh back end
communication Tech to a new framework
which we already battle testing in life
right now but like a lot of new services
using that new tech so there's a lot of
like moving parts coming together so
every piece we had on top of that adds
more risk right so now we also need to
change matchmaking now we need to change
like all those things and it obviously
makes me makes the release way less
manageable right so what we do is we try
to reduce the risk by let's obviously
the the core needs to come as one piece
because there's no way to just
introduce the replication layer without
the database for example we need the the
minimum set pushed together but we can't
like we try to reduce okay what can we
not do right now let's do that in the
next iteration otherwise it will be just
a burning pile of of issues we have to
walk through and even then I I think it
will be it will be a very rough start to
get 3.8 in life and just because it is
so much new technology and every time
you you take uh something we build
in-house which is already very
complicated because it has
thousands of different moving parts and
then we take that into the cloud and
open it up for whatever ten thousand
twenty thousand fifty thousand players
that's always where you get another
chunk of new things we haven't
anticipated like all all to manage all
of that it's already a giant piece so
everything we can put off for later
scope down exactly is is in my my book's
a good thing and I think also for you
players we don't want to like absolutely
ruin your experience
um I hope we won't
um
so I think even though the feature set
might be limited on this first version
ultimately you guys will benefit from it
because otherwise you will just get like
a complete unstable patch and then you
you have to suffer through it for like
one two three patches uh until until we
get get live and also helps us obviously
to bring it faster into your hands right
as you know we we rely so heavy on you
guys to play our game and be our beta
tester which which is Amazing by the way
um but in order to to to to to benefit
from that we need to push things out as
they come online and not just wait until
it's fully perfect and fully polished
and then give it to you so we we won't
give you iterations as fast as we can
but that sometimes means that it's maybe
a step back or it's it's not fully
feature complete just yet I mean you
guys all been in the game for a bit so
so we're just saying is that we're
already juggling puppies lightsabers and
chainsaws to get through to 18 we don't
need to add a giraffe into it
yes that's exactly that's a pretty good
not my best analogy
um I do want to detour a little bit and
talk about chat uh uh Chad's like hey he
didn't mention cargo refactor when he
was listing off 318 things I didn't
mention a lot of things in 318 but I
will remind folks who've read who are
regular readers of our monthly report
and who are regular Watchers of ISC and
scl the cargo refactor is necessary for
Salvage to work uh if you watch the
whole scraping and vulture segments in
last week's episode The bit where the
cargo was physicalized in the back of
the ship and you had to move the boxes
that was the cargo refactor so remember
as uh we the roadmap Roundup announced
yesterday the day before I don't know
what day it is now uh 318 is not
scheduled to come out until early
November mid-november something around
that I don't remember what it says so we
have time to show the cargo refactor in
ISC so we still got weeks this quarter
and then we got a couple weeks next
quarter before the patch comes out so uh
as of this moment
with the only constant in game
development being changed but as of this
moment cargo refactor is still very much
in 318 it's still very much expected in
318 it is necessary to have Salvage and
Hull scraping and the vulture so
yes and on top of that I would also it
it's not not just for Savages also as I
said this persistent anti-streaming we
replacing the whole Foundation a lot of
game systems actually need some form of
refactor to work with that it's not just
cargo but part of why the cargo team
needs to do their reflectors also to
support personal entity streaming but
other things like the insurance system
the VMA the character customizer
whatever the scanning transaction
systems
even the trended system all those things
they needed changes for personality
streaming so there's a lot of like those
teams they like it would be awesome if
they could always just work on new
features but especially with large
foundational changes like this they need
to go back and just adjust what we
already have which is also again
which is why there's not just cats and
dogs and chainsaws that's actually 20
other things in that mix already so
double slasher says Benoit is already
laughing nervously that's just how we
laugh
yeah that is true
um
uh I'm gonna jump ahead in our list
again to to a question that's come up
quite a bit in the chat make sure we get
them all in since we're already in the
back half of our show here
um
let's say
I'm engaged in
Furious one-on-one combat with another
player uh we're we're we're we're we're
we're we're in our furball and I'm about
to lose and I decide rather than to take
my death I choose to alt f4 and just
quit the client uh what does PES do for
this situation how does PES handle this
situation if at all
first of all that's a bastard move right
but
um
so uh not entirely related to PES I
understand the mental link right between
like persistence and spawn points and
you know out the flooring and stuff
um there already have been some changes
in the game related to quote unquote
combat logging which is basically
outdooring while in combat to save your
FPS items uh already the ships stay in
the game World in 317 uh and then you
can you know they basically get
destroyed uh on basically that move sort
of allows you to save your your weapons
and armor right where you respawn
outside so PS is not gonna solve that
because that's driven by game rules uh
so even though we have persistence
that's the thing I wanted to stress out
even though entities persist the game
rules and the game code can still decide
what to do they can override any values
right so like if you think about
respawning or things like that same
thing for logging so
for combat logging more specifically
uh the which is a problem obviously
right and we it's something that we're
gonna want to tackle at some point but
it's the the real fix for that is not a
new persistent system if if PES solved
all the world problems that would be
awesome but it's not the case uh the the
real solution is a proper logout timer
where if you decide to alt the four or
to kill your client or whatever you stay
in the game world for that lockout timer
which will allow your assailants to
basically finish the job if they have to
right and that makes the game fair most
other games also do the same thing so
that's where we're that's the idea that
we have on the table now but obviously
we're not tackling this specifically
with PS as uh even though there is
persistence it's not going to affect
combat logging specifically it's a game
design task not a PES task yeah pretty
much yes I would add though though
because of PS the log in and log out
code has to change slightly it gives the
game game the game code teams actually
the opportunity to address this issue
and as when was said we're currently
discussing some of the login logout flow
and as Ben was said adding a proper
logout timer to that would be a would be
a good opportunity right now to do
another question I also saw ask a lot is
when I log out with persistent entity
streaming will I log back in where I
left off right
and again to our Point let's go get back
to feature parity
um for 3.18 we will keep our current
lockout system so when you log out and
you log back in you look back at your
last Landing Zone location however
um PS does
enable all of that cool stuff so with PS
it would be very trivial for game code
to change their systems to allow you to
lock exactly back where you where you
left off right however it always comes
back to how much risk we want to add for
3.18 and also
the devil is always in the details if we
want to have game code now to complete
the change okay you log back in where
you log back out and that doesn't mean
okay we have the tech right now so we
can just enable this feature that means
a lot of design work like how does it
work for example if I am suffocating and
I log out I think the design wants you
for example then to run a timer and
eventually when you log back in you
would be dead because you were
suffocating at that moment so you want
to spawn back in hospital and so on so
there's a lot of design a consideration
coming into play and then also game code
systems which need to handle that
properly for example what if I log out
on a planet and then on the next day I
log back in and that exact position is
another ship Blended at the moment right
so all right game code would need to
probably do some position resolving and
all those kind of things so in order to
not tackle that right now
um we would just keep the login logout
flow how it is um however as I said with
persistent entity streaming
game code teams now have all the tools
at their hands to fully persist whatever
they want at this at the state and and
restore at exactly the state uh how they
left it goes back to what we said at the
beginning this is a new Foundation a new
set of tools and abilities that then it
gets handed to every other designer and
programmer in the in the game and then
they can begin to address the things
they've always wanted to address but the
old Foundation couldn't let them or even
conceive entirely new ideas based on
these this new 100 yes and and that's
also a very good point you're bringing
up there I mean we we as a company we
are a very large company with different
teams work on the different features and
this is an entity streaming uh when we
did this as our as our core Strike Team
and work on the core foundational Tech a
lot of like of the other game teams they
probably don't really grasp yet what
they can actually do with it right so
now that we've brought our Tech into the
main line and the game now starts using
using new technology I think that's the
moment where game teams and designers
really see how it works and how they can
interact with it and that's when exactly
how you you said hey Jared that's when
new ideas spark and okay how can we
exploit this new tech how can we make
really cool features and oh now we can
do the thing which we couldn't do three
years ago let's re-wam power login
logout works but all this stuff will
just come online now as the the
foundational Tech is in the game I think
there's also an interesting element of
surprise I think that we're expecting
already just uh you know being in the
main line for a little bit where uh the
you know the entity system has this
concept of serialized variable I'm sure
we've talked about this in the past
right which are basically variables that
are replicated when we say replicated
it's between the server and the client
um now these things did not persist for
right so everything that needed to be
persisted needed to be handled as a
persistent item whatever PS makes all of
those serialized variables persistent
and so that means that any game
component that was made using serialized
verbals suddenly has persistence so I'm
expecting uh some surprises right so
things that oh oh [ __ ] now this persists
wow this is cool uh for example wear and
tear on your armor or things like that
you know like uh you know are are now
gonna just stick right because before
they were lost every respawn now these
things can actually persist for real
exactly it's it's I want to follow up on
some things before we move on
um obviously with regards to the with
regards to the log out timer uh anybody
any person that's ever worked on any
online game knows the difficulty of
managing a log out timer and stuff that
that
you know punishes the people who alt f4
and and and try to abuse the system
without also punishing folks who have
legitimate client crashes or internet
outage and whatever that that balances
is one of the forever challenges of
every online game and Star Citizen is no
more immune to it than anything else so
that is one of those considerations that
will obviously be debated and talked
about and discussed and for Ad nauseam
until we come up with whatever our
solution is and I'd no doubt we'll look
at what other online games are doing and
stuff like that because you don't have
to reinvent the wheel if there's a
solution out there already
um and then
I do want to add on a personal note
um folks will often it's easy to assume
that we do these shows just for the
backers that when we produce an ISC or
an SEL it's just for the people who
support the game but one of the weird
kind of
Hidden Truths that have emerged over the
years is that it's also a great way to
inform your work base a lot of the
people who work for cig learn about what
other teams are doing and how they're
progressing and get ideas for oh they
got that you know I can do it over here
I already had somebody one I had
somebody message me and say the camper
chair that they saw Lewis making one
episode is the exact thing they need for
this other thing they were considering
they didn't know it existed until they
saw it on SEL one of the reasons we
decided to do this show was because a
lot of these misconceptions and
misunderstandings and stuff that we were
seeing within the community also existed
within our own teams oh yeah so it's
it's you know it's I'm not ashamed to
admit that this is a really big huge
change to the foundation of the game so
so as as Paul said it's it's one of the
reasons 318 will be about maintaining
and converting uh what we had and then
like We're Off to the Races with what
with with the with what every other
programmer and designer in this company
once they have this tool set with them
uh is inspired to create and that's
what's really exciting about PES
um all right we have got 15 minutes left
so I want to talk I want to talk about
some density management stuff because a
lot of the big a lot of the conversation
is about you know I'm gonna throw a can
somebody's gonna throw a can somebody's
gonna throw a can of prison we're gonna
have giant mountains of trash like it's
Idiocracy
um uh uh what are the movie by the way
what are the plans for culling in PES
will it involve staying when in
proximity to players uh what can you
tell us about calling plans okay uh
that's a good question
um with our old system we had this uh
it's called lifetime management and it
would arbitrarily remove entities once
they had a certain cup and we realized
that's not really great for play
experience for example I think at the
moment players can only spawn up to
three ships if they spawn another ship
the old one gets removed
um for persons and entity streaming we
actually revisit that problem and we we
decided okay how can we make this a uh
nicer for the player but also B how can
we make this actually work uh good for
personality streaming and also for
Server meshing where maybe it doesn't
make sense if if a player has five ships
spawned and they're all separated in
open space and streamed out they don't
really cost us performance so why why do
we still need to arbitrarily limit that
and for that we have uh the the guys in
Frankfurt developed a new system it's
called density management
and it operates on relative cost of an
area so the idea is that instead of just
taking arbitrary numbers on objects we
look at areas and we look at the amount
of items in that area and we only start
to remove items the moment the the
relative cost of that area becomes too
high so as long you spawn your ships in
different locations and they're all
spread out we will never touch them or
remove them however if like now everyone
goes to the same spot and you start
spawning ships and spawning ships at the
same location that's when this the
system will find out okay now the
performance goes down because our
relative cost in that specific area goes
to high and then we will start deleting
items which also follows a certain rule
set so we will delete all those items
first we will also have a relative
priority on items so a playership for
example is very high priority right so
we would not delete the playership
versus a coffee cup for example would be
the first item to to go away
um and then with with that we try to get
the game to like where it's very uh it's
not very invasive to you so you don't
just see stuff disappearing out of out
of an air exactly like the the approach
we're taking is that most of this
cleanup will happen during stream out so
if an area streams out that's when the
density management will make a first
initial pass I will say hey in this area
we had 50 coffee cups and that's uh
that's that's too much so we start
removing them and then we only go into
the more aggressive policies once it's
really becoming maybe an area never
streams out or whatever all players
decided hey I mean I kind of expect that
right once we go get PSL probably
everyone will like let's all go to port
olusa and drop all our coffee mugs on
the floor and like keep doing that right
that's what you guys will do anyways
um so I hope I didn't gave you any ideas
that idea was already out no sure yeah I
figured I figured that's as much so uh
basically the system the system will
take care of this but it will be a
smarter system it's a smarter system
than what we have right now yeah one one
thing to add to density management too
is that it it also has this concept of
references and so for example if an
entity because this also covers NPC
entities right so like AIS and you know
whatever else and so if a specific
um entity is actually being referenced
by a mission active Mission or active
player for example then there's a ref
Gant thing a reference counting system
that will prevent those from being
actively reaped so that you know it
again the the I think the goal with
density management is really to make
sure stuff doesn't pop out of your view
you know and and break your game
experience so but we still need a a
density measurement system to prevent
you know overloads but that's the
approach in general with the with the
talk about the priority system and and
that's all very very cool and very
needed I think whatever current priority
system we have thinks hospital gowns are
the most important thing in the entire
universe they are just the sheer number
of hospitals and I guess weapon crates
too but sure just yes box armor less but
I think it's a flaw of the current
system because uh it's not that's not
intended not if you really like
hospitals
it is it is basically a design bug by
with our current lifetime system you
have to put in a lifetime policy on
every single item uh entity class and
then if you if you forgot that for
example on an item box that means those
item box never get cleaned up uh or if
you set a wrong value on it so it's very
uh like at this when we initially
designed that I thought we thought it's
a good idea to give like per entity
class a policy however with so many
different entity classes it it becomes a
maintenance and uh also uh a balance uh
Nightmare and for that we basically went
away and said okay well let's
programmatically calculate the cost of
items and it it doesn't really matter
like uh if if someone changes the the
asset for an item it will automatically
update the cost of the item because we
look at the actual the mesh and the size
the bounding box and and and figure out
the cost that way
um and then the only thing designed
needs to do is give it a little bit of
different priority
um and at the same time as Benoit said
also like a mission relevant objects we
just like give them a ref counter while
the mission is active so the density
system wouldn't delete a mission
relevant objects which would render your
mission for example uncompletable so we
want to avoid basically the density
system deleting whatever your your
mission box you're supposed to pick up
right
um but but that system
um like again it's not intentional what
we have right now in the game it's just
the result of our old lifetime system
and and just the sheer amount of uh
maintenance and and balancing design
needs to do to uh to to get the system
right and that's that's also part why we
replaced it with the new density
management and it also the old system
never took a location into account right
it doesn't matter if 50 items are on the
same location or 50 items spread out if
the system thinks oh 51 it's one item
too much I delete the render one
um and obviously that's not really what
what we want and it also predates even
server streaming with server side
streaming we can now have items in the
world as long they're not streamed in
they don't cost anything right they they
are just in memory and now they're in a
database so it's even cheaper to hold
them so
if density was too too aggressive it
would basically undo whatever PS is
trying to achieve so it needs to be
perfectly balanced right that's that's
actually exactly that that set though I
still expect the first iterations of our
first evocati test that we need to tweak
the system heavily because we haven't
like really seen how it behaves with you
know we can do all our testing in-house
it's never the same as if you open it to
you guys and you just do whatever you
guys do in the game so until until that
happens we obviously there will be there
will be heavily tweaking so maybe the
first version will be very aggressive
and then we need to tone it down
um but in the end the system will will
give a better play experience for sure
so bad news for anybody that's been
hoarding hospital gowns to use the
currency in the post-apocalyptic future
of Star Citizen
um I took note that we should lower the
priority of Hospital guns
all right so I think we got time for
maybe two more questions
um uh I want to jump ahead to uh to a
very common one about mfds and stuff uh
will PES allow for ship States uh mfds
gimbal modes scanning angles all these
things to persist uh within player ships
so the I did actually inquire about this
a little bit before we came here because
obviously this is game go driven so it's
not something that the PS team actually
controls though we do enable persistence
for those things so
um
I do believe that gimbal's modes might
persist because they're implemented with
a serialized variable so that mean that
this would stay for mfds and scanning
angles we don't know yet that needs to
be confirmed by the combat team uh but
there if it's implemented with
serialized variable then yes uh if it's
not and it's a reset like again a bit
like the spawning location right if they
every time you sit in the seat it
changes a value then doesn't matter if
it's persisting right so uh but that's
something that all the game teams will
be tweaking up until we get there and if
they can benefit from it I'm sure they
will jump on it absolutely yeah this is
I I really like this question because it
demonstrates
the uncertainty that's involved in
what's going to happen in in the next
couple weeks uh obviously this the first
version of the persistent Universe went
out in December 2015. since I mean
there's there's a lot of entities
there's a lot of code there's there's a
lot of people who have come through cig
and and created things in one way or
another way and it's impossible to know
how this change is going to affect
everything that's been the huge testing
that we've been doing internally we
already talked about that's the months
of testing that CI referred to in the
letter from the chairman back in uh
spring of this year I don't remember
what month uh but yeah so it's we're
going to discover that stuff together
when we go to ebukati through PTU and
then yeah it's just it's a question of
just converting those things that aren't
two so that they will work uh last
question uh before we go
um I asked you this at the end of our
last is our last Bes report Benoit I'm
going to do it again because now that
Paul's here
how do you feel it it's we've done we've
done a lot of tech talk we've done a lot
of you know process stuff but you guys
have been on this for over a year I I
mean I don't I don't know exactly how
long you've been on it but with with the
light at the end of this tunnel not
exactly close but closer now than it's
ever been how are you guys feeling
me personally I'm super excited like as
you said we worked on this like almost
two years uh on the new database on a
new tech and we worked obviously with
our Strike Team pretty hard but in
isolation in our own stream to develop
all the tech develop new Services uh all
this stuff and now that we finally in
gained if it's really exciting to see it
all come together uh to start seeing
game code teams jump on it and adjust
their system uh so it's really it's it's
really great and and for me I also
personally feel it's it's a very big
stepping stone towards server meshing
because that this is the tech which
actually enables us to separate the
simulation from the state and that will
allow us to introduce server nodes and
it will allow us to replicate State
between different servers and that will
also allow us to really scale scale the
system right so I'm super excited uh at
the same time time it's also a giant
challenge as I said it's a ton of new
Services ton of new technology it all
needs to be better tested
um we're working hard on that
um but yeah I'm I'm I'm excited I'm
happy that we we got the tech together
like the the foundational work uh we got
it in the main main line and now it's
just tweaking stabilizing and getting it
uh in your hands for for testing and
destroying it yeah I'm still I'm still
excited as well like the the it's been a
super big rush to get it in the main
line but now we get all the energy of
the entire company behind us so it's
really
you know that gives us another boost
right to you know get there obviously it
also comes with a bunch of issues but at
this point it's it's fun to fix them and
you know we actually see the effect in
game and different subsystems and stuff
so it's it's super exciting and it's
also it was great to go through
questions from the community and try to
you know get the especially the plans
for 318 which I know are not simple to
understand because of the where we're
going and this is like the stepping
stone to get there but it was really
interesting to see how you guys see it
uh also some questions were interesting
in that in in sort of predicting what
could happen which is which is also
great we're in the same boat right like
even though we do try stuff and we know
what will work and what will not there's
so many subsystems there that you know
there's a lot of room for surprises so
we'll see but yeah I'm totally
pumped yeah uh I I feel like other
projects might be afraid to admit how
much they don't know but that's that's
not what that's not that's not cig
that's not us uh we're going to discover
a lot of this together
as it continues to go um all right we've
still got a minute I'm gonna ask one
more question then
[Music]
you've you've you've got this audience
here that'll go up on YouTube you've got
the audience there what one thing do you
want to make sure everybody understands
about this work about PES about 318
about your role in it whatever you want
if if you could if if you could make
sure drive home one last thing that you
want to make sure everybody takes away
from this what would it be
like for me it would really be the
appreciation and the understanding that
while on the surface especially with
3.18 it might not feel too different of
what we have in the previous build
the foundational changes underneath and
the the structural changes in our core
engine in our core entity system all
like everything you do runs to complete
new set of servers complete new set of
like the replication layer got
completely Rewritten
The Entity system got completely changed
we separated entity creation and entity
spawning there's a lot of like really
cool stuff and like really exciting Tech
behind powering that uh and it's also
all made to scale and to like run in the
cloud have stateless Services be able to
horizontally scale this thing and like
all this stuff even though in this very
first version it won't
feel so much different like the code
that runs behind the scenes a little
bits and bytes are completely different
um and just to get to parity this is
what we had before is a giant
achievement even though it doesn't feel
so different in the very first version
yeah no I think I think you hit the nail
perfectly I think that's the that's the
big change right is that we're we're
finally making with this I think the
game at true cloud service as it should
be a cloud native service which is
really what we need to make a real
persistent universe and so we're this is
a giant step in that direction right uh
in moving the game server and its
services together into a true Cloud
native setup that can really scale to
the vision that Chris has for this game
which you know even for persistence
itself it's persisting the entire game
world is you know so it's crazy like
it's a lot of data it's tell you know
it's millions of entities that need to
be stored and retrieved and so
like Paul said well it doesn't look like
much has changed
getting the data in the game server and
out of it has completely changed which
which is a big it's a lot of code and a
lot of code changes that touched it
all right gentlemen you did it you typed
my persistent enemy
and we made it through the full hour uh
I think it was a good show to coding
yeah we got a lot of good information
out there hope you guys enjoyed it as as
much as I did uh remember uh iscs just
came out uh updates on hole stripping
and uh uh the Drake bulture and a little
bit about FPS repair in there and tucked
in there so check that out uh next week
on ISC we've got a meet the team for a
brand new team that is that has not
existed in at cig before uh they were
founded just five months ago and this
will be the very first time you're
hearing from this team and getting
introduced to the team I'm not going to
tell you who it is you're gonna have to
tune in to find out uh and then uh and
then yeah we'll be back here for Star
Citizen live next week
um
I didn't look at who it was before I did
this I'm not perfect I really should do
that stuff and then the big thing though
I remember citizen con is coming back on
October 8th uh it is your chance to see
the latest and greatest uh uh uh from
many of our teams around the around the
globe as we begin this journey to 4.0 uh
uh uh storytelling promotion that we're
doing you're gonna see that stuff in
citizencon and then you know continue
beyond that so check that out uh that'll
be on Twitch uh I I think we're starting
at 8 A.M Pacific but check out
citizencon.com for the details because I
clearly cannot remember them so for Star
Citizen live I'm Jared Huckabee that's
Ben Wabo seizure and I always say his
name because it took me so long to learn
it I'm so proud of myself
Paul Rendell thank you so much for
hanging out with us and we'll see you
next week everybody take care thanks
guys thank you bye-bye
that sounds perfect you have it I know
excellent it only took me like six years
that's okay you have to you have to work
on your grindel though reindel
yeah
I'll work on it
