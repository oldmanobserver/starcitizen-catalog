it's a time of change here at Star
Citizen the Frankfurt office has moved
into their new digs the Winslow office
prepares to migrate to Manchester
starting next week our citizencon
presentations are looming just nine days
away and much of the focus of our
development teams at present is in
preparing for the upcoming Alpha 318
with persistent entity streaming that
serves as the foundation not only of
server meshing in Alpha 4.0 but
everything else in the persistent
universe as well and since Alpha 318 is
now scheduled to arrive in the first
half of November and ISC enters its
regularly scheduled Hiatus the next few
weeks we thought we'd take the
opportunity to try something new with
our last episode of the quarter a
follow-up to each of the 318 related
feature segments that we've done this
quarter looking at how they've continued
to grow since we last showed them to you
answering your questions that you had
after watching and rolling them all into
one big super sized report that we're
calling the ISC follow-up
because we're we're really really good
at naming things
enjoy
so since updating you on the rivers
earlier this year I've been focusing on
the visual quality of the rivers
themselves so when you explore them they
are looking better than ever
I think the biggest visual change I've
introduced to the rivers is the new
Cliff spawn points previously where we
had steep edges along the river we just
had the terrain texture that we get on
steeper parts of the terrain but I
wanted to kind of increase the visual
Fidelity of this by spawning Cliff
meshes along the edge of it so that's
exactly what we've done
for the cliff mesh spawn points we add a
new spawn point at the height of where
the terrain would have been if the river
wasn't there so that we can control
where the top of the cliff is relative
to the edge of the terrain near it and
that's these red spawn points you can
see here
when I turn these back off
you can see we have Cliff meshes that
look as if they're the right height you
can walk onto them from this terrain
here while still providing a nice kind
of closed-in gorge for this River
and actually we were so happy with the
results of adding additional spawn
points around these gorgey areas that we
decided to add more spawn points along
the edge of normal Rivers as well so
that we can get rocks right along the
edge of the water to break up the
silhouette between the terrain and the
water you can see those points here and
when I turn back on the scattering you
can see what that looks like
so as you can see that really helps to
break up the silhouette of the water but
also makes the whole area feel denser
and more real
another visual Improvement I've worked
on for the river is using more splines
for the river modifiers instead of just
a single Central spline along the path
of the river we now have a spline for
where each of the edges can be and this
gives us much finer control over how the
terrain should dip down into the river
which is what actually matters rather
than the depth at the middle for most
cases but it also means that we
eliminate some of the effects we were
getting at sharp bends what we used to
get at the sharp Bend of a river was a
pinching effect in the middle here where
the terrain would jump from referencing
a point somewhere here on the spline to
reference single point somewhere here on
the spline so you can see that they're
basically equal distance from a point
over here so we'd either be referencing
the terrain from one or the other
without ever kind of passing through
this middle bit now that we have a
spline for each Edge we can pick which
Edge is closer and then more closely
reference that when picking the final
height for that part of the terrain and
it just means that the the edges of our
rivers are much much cleaner we're
getting much less in terms of
artifacting that we were seeing before
and the overall result is just a lot
better in my opinion
[Music]
I'm really really excited to see all of
the new Rivers come into 318 very very
soon put a lot of work into improving
the visual quality of the rivers as well
as improving the tooling for our artists
to be able to place more and more
interesting Rivers our Tech artists have
been hard at work for the object presets
for the for the rivers to make the make
sure that we're getting really really
cool distributions of objects around
them and I just think what we're going
to see in 318 is going to be A Cut Above
what we've had so far and I'm really
looking forward to it thanks all
foreign
we spoke about the PTV racetrack it's
been mostly just bug fixing for the most
part it's been like the usual occasional
Collision issue we had to fix up
um also there was like instances where
rqa testers just
took the card and went off the of the
track and like drove into the elevators
and got into other parts of the level so
I kind of had to go around and fence off
all the areas where people could leave
the track also just in some cases
on like inside the track there was
a little shortcuts
that could be taken so also these ones
had to unfortunately block them off so
nobody can gain an unfair advantage
one of the things we didn't discuss last
time is where the buggies actually come
from so this they're not something the
players bring themselves into the space
there is this little side section of the
track where they spawn and you take them
and then just kind of bring them over to
the to the starting line and start from
there
and when they're destroyed then they
basically respawn in that section again
so there's always eight buggies for the
players
I can't wait to see what place uh we'll
do with it once they get it in their
hands
it's the last time we spoke Korea has
changed a lot in its environment uh
we've been sort of building opened
sort of breathing new life into it
making it on par with uh some of our
locations in terms of branding and sort
of how we want the player to move
through the space
with this cs1 and two crimes that one
and two are no longer going to be things
that get you shocked or get you you know
stop you from landing at a location
these fines will essentially just be
like mini slaps on the wrists law
enforcement or comment on them when they
stop you and tell you to go pay you find
off but they're not going to be as big
of a a meaning as they once was
alongside this we've also added uh other
ways for the players to
get rid of their sort of criminality to
find kiosks that you can find all around
now have a button that allows you to
surrender to law enforcement this gives
you the 20 discount of your time served
when you go into prison
uh and as always this is gonna go live
and we're going to continue iterating on
it reading feedback and making
improvements
so when the first video released and we
was talking about cluster I was watching
HC vertigo
um and he pretty much nailed the mission
and who was given it so uh I'm not gonna
spoil it I don't want to let you know
but uh yeah if you want to find out who
it is go check out he Virgo
since the last time we talked about
clasher and the new updates to that
things are going along nicely we have ai
walking about uh they have Loot on them
uh they're making the environment feel
more alive the black spot is in the
mission is working in the mission we've
added roots coming out of the wall so
that even though people might know how
to beeline it out of there now they have
to figure out how to get to this place
they've never been to before and break
the route they're normally used to and
then have to rejoin which is the
difficult part because we always make
the rejoining bit harder and they can
fall all the way down or you know
whatever so that's it for the updates to
clasha uh check it out when you get a
chance
foreign
caves changed since we last spoke about
them just on my fixes and some Polish
work so
yeah they're done
so it's been a couple of weeks since the
last time we talked about the Daymark
crash site and since then we've mostly
been polishing and debugging we had a go
no-go during which everything went
smoothly
we actually noticed during play tests
that the missions were too easy so we
just did some tweaking we added some AI
on the level art side they were working
on some lods so how far the objects are
going to display we did the better
navigation pass for AI and for the
player
um and I think we tweaked a little bit
the cave but there's just a crash chip
in there nothing else
we've also been working in integrating
all the missions so there's going to be
three missions on the Denmark crash site
there's going to be a kill specific a
kill all and a delivery missions where
you need to go in and uh gather some
crates and deliver them uh We've also
been working on changing up the AI
That's there because currently it's the
nine tails and we wanted to add a little
bit more diversity in there so we're
working on adding in the sand Nomads
which are probably not going to be here
for this release but possibly the next
one
[Music]
since we last talked about The Siege
Verizon Mission last week uh I forgot to
mention there's also submissions just
coming to the islands that the siege of
horizon takes place on
so these missions are going to take
place on the islands when Siege isn't
active uh the missions we have you doing
will take you from building to building
eliminating a number of enemies or maybe
taking out a high value Target
these missions are currently just like a
prototype they're very basic they're
just kind of exploring what direction we
want to go at for these and other
Islands
so these will be another small addition
when 318 goes live
so there were some questions after we
released our last ISC where we talked
about Hull scraping and uh there are
some things that I can clarify from our
position so what makes a reclaimer more
profitable or better for in comparison
to the vulture for t0 there is no real
difference so the only difference there
is you have more space to store your
your script of Home material but the
proper differences only come with Savage
T1 so once we talk about
munching and uh actually uh like
converting proper ship debris into
smaller bits the size of the the
reclaimers definitely an advantage here
some comments were all all asking about
how can we use the scraper beam in an
offensive manner technically you can but
you have to make sure that the target
ship has its Shield deactivated so as
long as another ship is shielded you
will not be able to touch the Hub
because there's like this energy field
that is protecting the hull
so there were also some questions on the
repair side and
sadly this repair iteration isn't the
full fleshed out repair that you might
need if your ship is fully destroyed so
if you lost the wing the wing is lost if
you lost your engine the engine is lost
so your your magically repair gun that
right now is taking the hull material to
create new Hull material so it this gun
isn't able to 3D print you an engine a
fully functional Engine with all its its
parts so what it does is just cover up
of like your Hull so it increases your
health of the ship again but only to a
degree where it is
reasonable in comparison to to what the
hull actually stands for
so the material that you gather with the
vehicle can be converted into the
material that you use for your
multi-tool to repair ships
there's one more thing so we saw that
you were already asking for what about
players that are not interested in any
combat scenario or in awaiting others to
shoot themselves to shreds and then
picking up the debris pieces for for
profit from the hull scraping
well we have a solution for for for you
and um well the miners of you might
already know it so we we will expand our
harvestable system
uh to also facilitate to spawn fresh
derelicts and what our fresh derelicts
basically they are just the husks of
existing ships
that have a probability to spawn in
Asteroid Fields or like basically around
all the LaGrange points and you will be
able to find them using scanning and
then approach them like you would do
with a minable and then scrape off their
home
and that is coming in Alpha 380.
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that when you show a feature the
very first week of the Season there's
lots of room for additional improvements
like we saw with rivertech that QA can
be just as squirrely as players when
testing the arena racetrack that Curry
is looking pretty fresh with its
Crusader makeover and that changes to
the law system will make crime Stat one
and two less Troublesome to deal with in
the future
in theory and that while Hall stripping
won't be the offensive weapon some folks
were theorizing using the harvestable
system to generate non-combat wrecks
will be a welcome addition to the more
peaceful minded citizens out there now
don't forget that citizencon is next
Saturday October 8th at 8 A.M Pacific 3
P.M UTC it's shaping up to be a really
informative quarter day and not just
visual updates that you've come to
expect but more design and gameplay
presentations that'll lead the way in
the star citizens future where inside
Star Citizen I'm Jared Huckabee we'll
see you next week at citizen gun
