well builds can break for a ton of
reasons it's not a point of Pride that
you know I start to Rattle off a whole
bunch of different things that break
bills because my whole vocation is to
create tools to create pipelines and
create processes that don't break builds
that are very very dependent but in a
perfect world that might be the case but
in the reality of things it can be so
many things there can be a per force
commit that completely destroys it
there's so many different types of
errors that can be a compilation error
that fails the build there can be build
errors that have nothing to do with the
actual game data itself we're trying to
move away from these kind of things but
having assets single points of failures
on certain assets so a good example is
like in our facial data we use a thing
called a DNA wrap deformer and it
literally just came up this last week
that there was a raptor former
attachment checked in that didn't have
an LOD any face that was attaching this
would fatal the entire game as soon as
QA got into it every two seconds they
were having a a fatal air which means
the entire build sort of shut down on
them and they couldn't proceed with
their testing so this is one of the
reasons that we put those asset
validations and those things in place
there is a lot of reason that builds
fail
um and you know part of the Tool's job
is making sure that those don't happen
so what is a build the easiest way to
understand a build is everybody's heard
of code compiling before and that is
there's there's raw code that is written
and then it gets run through a compiler
and then out comes a binary or an
executable as people would understand it
um the same actually happens with our
assets so sometimes our assets come
through and they'll be in an
intermediate type format and then those
will get sent over to the build system
to be compressed in such a way that is
actually a lot easier for us to deliver
the build to uh users and for the bill
to actually be able to run a lot quicker
in order to distribute a version of the
game to all the developers so we can
continue producing the game we create
what we call a build every well many
times a day as work is completed it gets
submitted to our source control system
per force which is basically a way of
just holding all of the assets all of
the code everything that goes into
producing the game this obviously is
being done by hundreds of developers or
in different Studios across the world so
when a developer comes in in the morning
they need to be able to depend on the
build for the day and the first build of
the day they're going to expect that all
the stuff that they checked in the night
before is actually present in that build
so that they can continue to iterate on
what they've been working on so a build
failing is a big deal it actually brings
down the entirety of the company on that
particular change list so there's a
whole bunch of ways that we actually
protect the build uh against failures
like this we run the assets through
something called asset validation and
what this is is a pre-commit check you
can also call it health checks for uh
for the asset so we run these through
what is this validation it checks for
all the common errors that we would uh
possibly make to the data and it's very
important because uh when you're
developing in the editor it can check
what you're doing within that one level
but it can't look at a holistic approach
so the editor itself will produce
various checks uh to make sure that
what's exported uh is in good shape but
the asset validator is very much a
complement to that checking things that
they cannot check at that time and then
if there's no errors it allows them to
commit it if there is errors it tells
him exactly what to do about it they go
and fix it and then are able to commit
again and we should be safe on the build
so we had a tool in place uh since since
I got here uh to cig actually and it
started as a very very small little
python script and over time as as with
any tool it it got a little more robust
but as it got robust it also got very
confusing to continue to build out it's
showing its age
um there's been a lack of
structure to it and it's been very
difficult to maintain and to keep up to
date so what we wanted to do was make
sure that Not only was it just the tools
team able to write asset validation but
also the rest of the teams and what that
required was a more robust framework is
sort of a plug-in kind of approach
um so we moved it from python over to
c-sharp and now we have much much
broader
um adoption for all the teams so that
they can write their own levels of asset
validation within the tool as well so of
course a big win for the tools team here
is that we don't need to create all
these tests we can allow the experts in
the other teams to do it for us other
teams among the company as we've scaled
up quite a bit comparatively to the
older tools can actually write asset
validation inside of this framework so
this was a really important part of the
new tool now it does everything that the
old one already did but now our
scalability is so much broader so as we
continue to develop Star Citizen we're
gonna have a more complicated systems
and therefore have a more complicated
assets and in particular dependencies
between them get ever more convoluted so
it's it's very important that we can
have a scalable system that allows
contribution from everybody to help
address the potential issues that this
could incur so the exact same way as a
player might be excited for a feature
coming from a feature team within cig we
have developers excited for a tool that
may be coming from the tools developer
within cig it's very much the same
Paradigm so when we bring up new asset
validation they appreciate having this
because they need to know about those
errors up front they don't want to wait
for the build to fail for some producer
to come to their desk and go why has
this failed why has your asset not
worked out for players especially this
is going to matter for you because as
you've been waiting for a PTU build or
an eptu build these failed builds slow
these things down and if we can't review
them we can't QA internally that means a
release doesn't go out so we're trying
to NAB it right at the very beginning so
that developer knowing that there is a
problem before it hits the build before
it fails to the build and before it
delays a release for you guys so the
tools team is incredibly important as
far as the develop helpers players and
builds go and hopefully this means more
builds will make it to players hands I
hope you've enjoyed this brief look into
the tools team and one of our products
and hope you see you're getting the
verse
while much of star citizens continuing
development is dedicated to creating
gameplay systems like cargo and Salvage
new locations like Rivers sand caves and
crash sites missions like the new prison
escape the auras and platform stuff the
time trial races and everything else
that's heading our way in the upcoming
Alpha 318 the folks that are focused on
the making and iteration of tools to
help the very process of game creation
itself are an essential element of the
of the Game Dev gumbo that we make here
and we're always thrilled when we can
give them a few minutes to shine but up
next the long-awaited often rumored
Polaris concept model internal layout
rework now it's not a series of New
Concept images like those that were
created for the 600i we showcased a few
weeks ago but this is a down in the
rough 3D Max model look at the reworked
concept mesh to explore the new internal
layout so potential Pirates can begin
plotting out out there boarding actions
enjoy
the Polaris is obviously a really really
old concept it's been around for a very
very long time it's one of the my early
ships that we did the exterior concept
out for the Polaris came out in I think
2017. uh lots of features have been
added to the game since then that we're
not known about at that time or couldn't
be planned for if they weren't known
about like a lot of the older ships
the interior just didn't fit it we
couldn't get the size the scale or the
metrics for how we would want it to
appear to actually fit inside the frame
that we had we've really now locked in
how we want the interior layout what the
impact of the exterior means and but
it's still the same Polaris that
everyone originally saw and and fell in
love with it just means that now it's
kind of fit for purpose whereas with the
initial Concept in phase and an initial
layout it wasn't quite where we needed
it to be
the exterior remains pretty much the
same Beyond it has got larger to
accommodate some of the Interior changes
the role is the same the key visuals are
the same you may notice again some like
panel line changes or turret updates but
fundamentally you look at the the
Polaris Now versus then it's almost
indistinguishable aside from that scale
change and the role remains identical to
what it was before moving on the inside
however we have a completely different
story although there wasn't much seen
for what the inside was going to look
like we had to remove a lot of that and
just start again we've fit the entirety
of the Interior inside of it while
taking into account the change in
component sizes where I went from size
zero all the way up to size 10
um whereas now we've got much more kind
of uh distinct categorization of our
components we've now got a capital
Shield generator Capital power plant
Capital support the actual size of the
ship and the scale of it especially For
What It's rule is within the actual
universe
so talking layout we don't have concept
images for every single room within the
ship but I can give you an estimation of
what you can expect from it so you start
from the bridge which has been opened up
a bit to give you a bit more space and
visibility behind that we then have the
Escape pod section where there's Escape
pods for the crew to be able to quickly
Evacuate the ship moving behind that we
then have the Captain's Quarters and
office as well as the seals office
behind that again we then have the
armory
moving further back we have the crew
bunk room and baths and showers
across from that we then have the wreck
area so it's where the food is it's
where the relaxation is for the actual
crew of the ship
moving back further we then come towards
the center of the ship where the actual
hanger of the Polaris is and that's had
a bit of a size increase so it's very
comfortable to fit things like a shaver
in it now
on the left and right hand side on one
side you have the medical facilities
on the other you have the Holden cells
for any prisoners or wrong doers that
you might get hold of
and then moving back you then have the
entrance of where engineering is which
spans about two decks
a small section of it is at the rear
which houses some of the more standard
components then the lower deck of
engineering holds the large capsicle
components for the Polaris
moving back forward to then from the
rear we then have the cargo halt
moving forward from the cargo area we
then have the Torpedo Room which has all
of the Torpedoes stored and an operation
station if anyone needs to maintain any
work down there
so the viruses concept completes we're
pretty happy with the updates to it
internally and hope you are as well and
now we are just at the point of
scheduling when we can jump it into
production it's naturally a large ship
slightly larger than it was uh so it's
not going to be a quick Endeavor but we
think it's going to be a pretty fruitful
one by the end of it the lessons that
we've learned over the years from the
evolution of making ships and their
Interiors have all come into play when
we've done the Polaris
and I can't wait for people to be able
to see it
so what did we learn this week well we
learned a bit about the build system how
it can break how it affects development
and how the new asset validation tool
and the work of the tools teams
themselves aim to combat that day in and
day out that the Polaris concept model
internal layout rework
is the last necessary step before that
much beloved vehicle can move into
production proper sometime in the future
and that if you want more information
about the process of ship creation and
everything that's involved including a
detailed breakdown of the newly revamped
vehicle Pipeline and a Canada discussion
