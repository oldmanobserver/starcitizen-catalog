hey all space dad here coming to you
from a secret facility that we'll be
talking more about next quarter now
alpha 318 has a whole lot of features
that players have been anxious for
updates on and while we'll get to all of
them like we always do before this
quarter is out we wanted to take this
week's show and slow things down a bit
for an uninterrupted unabridged chat
about persistent entity streaming what
it is how it's been going where it's at
now and what's coming up next and we'll
get back to our normal features next
week but for now please join me in
welcoming benoit beauceur cto of our
partners at turbulent for what we're
calling our very first pes report
so benoit
welcome back to isc to start things off
give us a nickel version of what
persistent entity streaming is
it's a personality streaming is a system
that allows us to persist the entire
game world and restore it from disk so
that it's never lost and changes from
players are meaningful and what's that
look like to the player how will players
know if pes is working or not uh it's
again they're gonna know because every
time they come back to the same server
the state will be the same so if you
leave a ship a can or any kind of items
in the world will stay there
you blow up a door it'll be blown on
that server forever but part of this is
something that cleans up the junk
afterwards right
yeah some items will be covered under
life cycle management which will get
recycled rights because obviously we
need some kind of janitorial
system behind the scenes but there also
are discussions about gameplay to do
that to help players to get players to
help us clean up the game world but yes
those are that's a new avenue that
persistent enemy streaming opens up
all right so we brought everyone up to
speed on what pes is let's get to the
updates now last time we heard anything
was from chris's letter from the
chairman back in may where we'd just
dropped something on the ground shut the
servers down brought the servers back up
and it was still there
what's happened in the last three months
uh well so the the team which is fairly
large team at this point has been
working really hard to get our first
stage delivery to what we call game dev
which is our main branch what that means
is we've moved from a prototypical
work branch into what everybody in the
company is using to develop the game and
so that's the big achievement is now the
the technology is in the game dev branch
so everybody is using it in day to day
day in day out testing uh and every you
know so all the bugs appear they're
right in our faces we fix them right
away
it's been a
bit of a crazy crazy time but that's the
big achievement in the last three three
months is that we've stabilized the
technology enough so that the entire
company can now be working on it
uh define crazy
they find crazy everything being on fire
like
you know this technology touches on
every subsystem in the game so transit
was busted uh you know like stuff was
persisting in the wrong locations
uh you can log into the game because
obviously with pes comes the a new login
flow to get players into the game
because we need to bring your items into
a new database so that entire system was
also as rocky to get in because there's
a lot of cases uh to deal with like
timeouts if you have too many items what
happens if you have too many items uh
you know and dealing with the different
all the different stages of the login
from authentication to you being
actually spawning in the game and so
it's been a lot of debugging
uh encountering issues on different
types of machines because when we start
you know all the developers have some
pretty good machines on the on those
feature branches but when we move to
game dev now we're exposed to all kinds
of different hardware
and you know
timing issues occur those are the weird
ones to find
uh they're really difficult to trace in
fact but uh so that's been the the
craziness is getting exposed to way more
machine types or users as well right
like uh the game requires a lot of
resources to run when we develop locally
and so sometimes you know one service
doesn't start on somebody's machine and
that causes you know all these crashes
to start being reported and now we have
to investigate them and so that's been a
bit of it's the real time effect that
makes it crazy it's like you know it's
not we're not making technology in a
bubble anymore where everybody's using
it and so that makes it really really
difficult to follow but it's been it's
been
fun to
finally get the technology in the hands
of people that can
uh really adjust it for the game and for
the players and
so that's been fantastic
so that's been the last couple months
but where are we at right now
so right now on the technology side
we're in bug fixing mode right and
identifying the elements that are left
that we are still you know rough around
the edges so let's i don't want to call
it polish it's really bug fixing back
testing stabilization
uh stabilization is the right word
that's what we're doing right now so
it's feature parity and making sure
everything works though it should
uh on the
other side there's a new team that's
kicking in work which is deployment
teams right so this is taking the
technology that we have working on a
game dev build and locally and basically
breaking it up into a lot of small
services that run in the cloud so the
operationalization of the technology
that's what we're uh really focusing on
now
it's like a dependent project right so
this allows us to basically uh bring the
game to you guys
that's where we can do ptu so ptu is for
a lot larger than
a developer running the game on his
machine
even though there's tons of services
when we go to the cloud you know we've
got operators that deploy that on
multiple machines and scale this out
this is made to scale so
so now it's about testing that that's
true so we've got the technology is
working now we're trying to scale it out
to the cloud c you know how many users
were kicking in and there the weight of
the entities how many entities we end up
having in the databases can they reload
fast enough you know testing all of the
facets of the assumptions that we had
but really getting the getting this
technology ready to be deployed for
players to play on
has the recent change in server player
counts had any effect on pes testing or
its development
well at first we thought it was going to
have an effect but the reality is the
same amount of entities get stored
whether 100 players are simulated or 50
so no for the moment there is no side
effect to having more
player player caps because the
you know obviously there's more entities
being changed but ultimately for the
same amount of players online whether
they're divided on 5100 players per
server doesn't doesn't change anything
for ps
great awesome uh but what's next where
do we go from here
where do we go from here it's a straight
line to uh deployment right that's the
only thing that matters right now is is
to make sure that
the technology can run in the cloud
properly that it scales out uh that if
we have more players coming in either in
a short period of time or in a long
period of time that we can
you know add more provisioning add more
machines to run it
um making sure it operates well at scale
uh so when you know
all of you guys are online to make sure
that everything's functioning properly
that we cover for we recover from hairs
this tech comes with a lot more
observability than the previous systems
that we had so we have tons of graphs
and like data that's coming in from the
system operating
uh and we're you know the teams need to
get used to this to be able to identify
problems to be able to help support we
have a bunch of new tools that we're
also working in the last
stretch here to uh allow game support to
uh help players that have issues for so
uh character repair is something that
we're starting to work on uh
mine the word here is not character
reset but character repair which is
something that we can now do
that we could not do before so
that will allow us to not
you know just destroy people's
inventories and items but really go and
fix one issue on their on so that they
can keep playing so
we're trying to get that in before we
launch it because we think that would be
a very beneficial uh for if there are
corruption uh events again we're trying
to this the technology is made to not
have those but
like better say that story right so
so yeah so that's the that's really the
work now is login flow and pes is just
stabilization and deployment so that we
can launch it so it's bee line for for
318 is is all it's like we're banging on
it
until it gets it properly
now i know we don't like to do dates but
we got a whole lot of player testers
waiting to help bang on the pipes you
wanna you wanna forecast anything oh no
i'm not even gonna try to gamble on that
one uh i mean we have it running in in
the cloud it's running right but you
know before we're comfortable
not sending the etf team into a you know
just fire drill
that's gonna be you know there's a big
difference between testers internal
testers developers using the system and
when we get real users on it it's
completely completely different right
and
uh so it's hard to say for me like i
can't i don't want to forecast it that's
fair that's fair now before we let you
go i want to reiterate that pes isn't a
traditional feature like players are
used to when it works star citizen isn't
going to look any different it'll just
be another step closer to functioning
like we've always intended to it's it's
a major step forward in stability
when all is said and done
yeah you know i'm not saying we're not
going to have wipes anymore because
there's always data changes that will
require us to do that but we're really
hoping that the technology will allow us
to have consistent
data which we don't always have right
now
uh you know all the every players had
horror stories of so you know how
they're you know losing their movie
glass or their eyes
which is incidentally one thing i
discovered in this project is that if
you don't have eyes you don't see
markers in your visor that's an
interesting one
uh but uh so trying to make sure that
the data's you know the technology will
make sure that the data is safe and
sound so obviously less corruption so
that's the first thing we expect second
one
stuff will persist and to be honest at
this time we don't totally know
what that's gonna mean
when we put real players in it right so
we do have life cycle systems and
cleanups and all that stuff yes we've
planned for that but we don't yet know
what you guys will do with it and that
will greatly affect how the technology
functions right in the end uh so that's
going to be interesting to see so as as
a player stuff you put on one server
will stay there right it's there until
the server gets you know wiped
manually but by default every server
will just persist
you know
like you said it's a stepping stone
technology
really what this means is behind the
scenes the simulation and the
replication of the game so simulation is
the stuff that runs the physics and the
rendering and the ai
right is one thing and the replication
which is sending updates and the state
of all these entities as they're being
simulated this used to be like this
right and now with pes and the game
server this is split into two and that's
the big achievement that ps allows us to
do
yes we get persistent state that's
awesome that's great but the real
thing is that we separate simulation
from replication and that allows us to
do server meshing after that and that's
the whole that's the reason why we're
doing this
all right last question then
how do you feel
good
i feel good tired but you know we're in
the home stretch so i'm i'm happy
i'm happy about where we are i'm happy
that the the company now can use the
technology and see what it what it's
like to persist everything i mean my our
dev servers are not littered with
you know stuff
playing around which uh which is cool uh
but uh i i know i feel good i feel
encouraged uh also stressed out because
like we need to scale it right so that's
the it's that it's that ten percent that
takes ninety percent of the time right
so that's the effect i'm
a bit stressed out for but it's okay i
feel good about it all right well thank
you for your time man
thank you man
so what did we learn this week well
hopefully it's that persistent entity
streaming may not be the most uh visual
of features but it is the next big step
in realizing a universe where players
can truly leave their mark the the last
major milestone that'll make server
meshing possible and that it's still
heading your way in the upcoming alpha
318. now thank you for taking this iscd
tour with us this week but don't worry
we've still got four more episodes left
this quarter where we'll be covering
things like hull stripping cargo
refactor the new 600i and msr crash
lights and more as well as meeting the
performance capture team and exploring
their new facility next door and then
maybe we'll stop by his people are
talking to my people we'll see what we
can make happen
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
you
