## Transcript

hi everybody uh welcome to uh the last
episode of Star Citizen live from the
void from my home
hopefully forever
here everything uh I'm your host uh
Jared Huckabee uh if you've never seen
Star Citizen live before it's where we
take about an hour out of the end of our
week and we hang out we chat uh we ask
some questions we learn about our guests
we learn about their work uh and uh this
week's guest is is a is a gentleman uh
who's very near and dear to my heart
probably has no idea how much so but uh
mostly I just like saying his name like
I just walk around randomly and I just
like saying his name uh it's it's AI
director Mr Francesco riccucci and
Jessica how you doing hi all good thanks
you know it's really great pleasure to
be here with you I I appreciate that
we'll see if you still feel the same way
uh by the end of the hour
well you know it's not the first time
that we had together so it's like you
know I know the feeling another thing
yes it's not the first time you've been
on the show but it's the first time
we're gonna dive deep into what makes
rikucci the who the what the where
but why
why rikuchi why
does everything you know very deep
questions you know let's see if I can
answer yeah for those of us who uh uh
who those of you anyway uh who didn't
see last week's show uh we are in the
citizencon pipeline we are just uh uh
eight uh short days away from uh
citizencon
2952 on Saturday October 8th uh because
of that and the big push towards 318 and
PES and a bunch of people on Squadron
like they've been follow years like this
uh we are we are we are we are relaxing
we are putting our feet up and we are we
are we're having a couple personal shows
a couple shows where we get to know some
folks uh if you remember the old meet
the dev series from way back in 2015. uh
something like that but more longer for
him uh if you're big if you have the big
questions like when's this come out and
when's that come out and and and why
isn't this like this well this probably
isn't the show for you so just giving
you that warning now so you don't
complain later instead we're gonna learn
all about
so let's start things off uh every show
is uh somebody's first uh while we while
you've been done this show several times
and we're not uh uh there are folks who
are no doubt watching right now who have
no idea who the heck you are so let's
start there uh who are you and what do
you do for a Star Citizen
so I'm Francesco Kushi as you said I'm
the director in calling Beyond games I
started in the company in 2015 it was
February
um so it's quite a while I'm here and
I'm basically responsible for all the I
Fidelity eye so everything that you see
you know how they behave how they what
they do uh what should do which systems
do we use uh you know on the on the
servers
it is what I'm responsible for and with
my teams uh right now the item is
structuring two three major teams I mean
as people cannot see from the monthly
reports we are kind of four now we have
a little bit no extra help from the
vehicle team uh so basically we have the
itech team the official team that
content team and the Big O AI team that
is like you know there are some people
in the vehicle team that you know start
to do a bit of AI work
Tech Team basically is supposed to
empower the other teams with technology
uh you know to fulfill the features that
the projects need uh the feature team
you know it's supposed to take this
technology and apply to multiple
um features that are requested by no
other requirements of the different
games uh the Star season and Squadron
and then the content team is mostly made
by you know
um uh designers and animators so what is
meant to be is to take all these
Technologies features and build a lot of
content
um
so yeah this is like all the people that
I either they either report directly to
me or you know I support and you know
overview and yeah try to help as much as
possible
and I'm gonna go full screen on this uh
what's on the back what's on the the
Whiteboard
so everybody's already found out this
whiteboard because I love riding on the
Whiteboard right so it's like there is a
little bit of stuff that I used to
explain things so we you know we have
this this room now and we you know lots
of people come and we talk about stuff
you know I like to draw to help myself
uh with drawing so even when we do
meetings right now I try to move the
board next to the camera and then you
know I try I draw stuff so there is some
usable uh stuff like you know use
Channel definition we are trying to
simplify a little bit some of the verbs
we use in the actions that I can perform
in the world so that we can unify a
little bit better and and make it a
little bit more consistent some of the
things that we have through some high
level explanation of subsumption data
work so subsumption you know uh low
level core uh logic works and you know
how instant share runtime data static
data on the different behaviors and
Mission logic and then there is some
more um
you know on the right side there are
some of the actions of the spaceships
you know that we want to do some of the
setup of the usables like counters
chairs yeah a little bit of everything
like you know
uh you said subsumption and you
mentioned the monthly report so we're uh
one last question before we take a step
back to your early days here
um folks who follow uh the monthly
reports and stuff uh it's probably where
they get the most uh AI updates uh in
general about the state of this the
state of that Squadron 42 Ai and uh the
persistent Universe AI in
foreign
what is subscription
so
basically Tony
yeah that's good so again talk for the
next hour uh so when when I basically
joined the company right Tony had this
speech for this architecture of AI
uh where there is a little bit of
separation between what we want to do at
High Fidelity what we want to do in a
simulation State and so on and so on
and subsumption is the name he gave to
this architecture
um what actually turns you know in
reality to be is this a combination of
stuff or when it says assumption I think
it's always like very very broad because
it contains both something that you know
a regular AI development you would call
for example Behavior trees or activities
or behaviors
um from the actor perspective the AI
agents and then we also include stuff
like missions logic so
I think we can talk about what is an eye
level and architecture level of what it
is that I could implementation site
right
so I think what subsumption wants to do
wants to model the world in a way in
which it becomes believable and you know
realistic
how you do that is with a combination of
things because in reality when you do
game development especially the eyes are
very big chunk of the experience that
you have but also it's not something you
can see in isolation right AI is the
output of the work that all the teams do
and there is a really large
multi-disciplinary effort into making AI
looking good right people sometimes
think too much there's a bit of magic
there's a behavior running and then
that's it but like AI is first of all a
lot of animations because animations is
the way in which we convey what actually
is happening behind the scene the same
is voice you know what they say uh
reality right like the smartness of
people and why we consider ourselves
smart is because we can express our
thoughts and how do we do that you know
with the language with you know uh you
know especially with the language that
is a construct that we make right to
express
um
feelings and ideas and they are in a way
needs to model this concept but also
make sure that whoever experience that
understands what they're doing because
my classic example is like you you might
have combat AI that is great and it's
blowing behind covers you don't even see
it it comes it pops behind you and it
kills you
the feeling you have is that they are
cheating even if they're not cheating
right because it's not fun to play
against it so I think we always have to
balance between you know having the
right tools to describe what AI does
what the word does you know what they
are supposed to do and then making sure
that what we describe translate into
something that the players can actually
perceive as smart but also fun and also
understandable all right so
subsumption is basically you know the
architecture that tries to achieve this
one
from multiple directions you know and it
tries to expose uh the sort of language
to multiple departments in a way in
which they can really perform their
duties basically
uh two follow-ups one uh anytime
a player is killed by AI it's absolutely
cheating and you should just come out
with it you should just be honest about
it we have to you know that's that's
what I say when I die and I play games
right it obviously can see through walls
and of course it's not me being bad
absolutely like I'm usually really good
you know I'm bad when I dive a player in
the real world of course but if I get
beat by an AI it's so I do things yeah
but the reality is also that that
sometimes yes the eye cheats right but I
think
our approach is usually really to never
cheat like the cheat that we do might be
more stuff like are you really
perceiving the guy that is you know in
this suit or do we read that data right
stuff that is more like the cheats for
me are more things that simplify the CPU
usage right and they
like they need to
your cheat compared to how the real
world senses might function but not in
terms of what you should know about the
world right what you know about the word
should always be fair for the players
and then of course you know
the uh
had a second thought but I wanted to
somebody said you mentioned the CPU
cycles and stuff uh and cheating and
whatnot it's one of the hardest elements
of balance just combat a obviously
there's many kinds of AI uh you know
there's not just combat there's also
bartenders
lots of bartenders so many bartenders
this book so much so many segments
so many stories about bartenders
but the
I lost my train of thought uh but you
mentioned the CPU Cycles is up um
one of the things that I've seen they're
two they're two
there are two things I think I always
knew but I didn't really I didn't really
understand I didn't really know that I
knew them instinctively somewhere down
playing video games my entire life I had
this I knew this but it didn't really
come into crystallization until I came
here and one of them is how much balance
in combat AI is linked to server
performance it it is it is it I have
seen like early tests of Siege of wars
and whatnot where the AI is just Robert
Patrick T1000 Terminators and just going
out and murdering everything and then
that exact same AI
gets put on an evil gets put on evocati
gets put on servers and whatnot and then
50 players jump in or 70 players at the
time when the test and whatever and the
server tick rate comes down and that
same AI that was so devastating in you
know just playing on a local machine or
a local server that's you know six
inches away from your gameplay machine
uh is now like a Three Stooges routine
you know it it it's like pull your head
out of your butt it's like what it's
it's all the programming and all the
effort and all the uh time and the
Artistry of your team and your
programmers to to to create these
varying levels and then to
put them on servers that are under
strain that you know need things like
server meshing and all a number of other
performance improvements uh
I don't know I don't really even
remember where I was going with the
question it was just it was just it was
that disparity
uh between the work that that you guys
can do to to refine and and perfect a
thing and then have it all go to hell
with a
bad server performance was just uh again
it's the thing I I think I knew but I
didn't really appreciate until I came
here yeah I think I think basically I
think well our game is pretty unique on
some of these things right for different
reasons one is I think right now in the
last uh weeks there's been a lot of
discussion in the industry about you
know game in development you know and
you know how things will actually look
behind the scenes of a game like I think
we have this special position where we
actually show a lot of the game that is
still in development right because we
are still in an alpha stage what that
means is that usually in a development
right you you pick your battles based on
where you want to be not just where you
are right so right now for example
you have a certain like things that
you're going to change is the time right
that you have and the resources that you
have and you need to try to balance you
know which type of task you want to take
so let's say we want to have a combat AI
you need to have a specific set of
features there and a specific set of
functionalities for designers for
example to balance the game right
balancing means how accurate they are I
often did they should you know which
type of tactics should they play uh you
know where should they be you know and
so on and so on now that one
as you say it needs to use a specific
set of CPU Cycles to do some of this
calculation
and
you need to distribute this calculation
because the more you're doing one frame
the more the frame costs
right you have a very quicker response
time from the eye because everything is
not in that server but if the frame you
know this frame rate goes down then it
means you have less you know more
latency on how the player can react to
that and solid song right now in our
multiplayer world of course we have two
parts that is that you want to have a
very high frame rate on the clients I
want to have a frame rate on the server
as well because of course the player
might see a word that's 60 frames per
second and then the server might run at
Three frames per second for different
reasons or ten frame per second or 15
frames per second you have a very wide
range of CPU usage right on the server
so for example CLG Horizon I think one
big Focus for us was trying to optimize
that usage overall not just on the eye
because of course using a lot of
but not only right it might impact the
elevator that comes might impact you
know physics uh calculation anything
pretty much on the eyesight right once
we have games
you know previous company I worked on
you know games that I worked on you know
we had like a very single play game
games usually you have a very strong
control on how many characters you want
to enable right so maybe you have 2016
20 enemies active at the same time and
those use certain things CJ Verizon you
know we had peaks of 2000 right and it's
like 2000 NPCs are not that simple like
2000 MBC they might fight play is not
just like background NPCs or stuff like
this right yeah
now can you be smarter on that side
absolutely is it something we want to
support long run that's sometimes the
question we need to answer like are we
expecting to have one server with 5 000
MPC activity at the same time as you as
you mentioned we are working towards our
mesh so then the decision comes towards
do we want to invest time right now to
make sure that we can run 5000 MPC on a
server or why are we expecting that we
have 1000 NPC on each server at maximum
right I'm actually with a certain you
know a lot of servers 500 RPC you know
you need to decide those type of budgets
are we expecting to have a population
manager that is smarter and decides well
there should be 20 MPC here and only one
there because nobody's around there
should they come out of Spawn closet
right these are all pieces that are
coming together right now but once you
don't have them sometimes you either
need to say like well except uh
unfortunately we are not there yet with
a type of experience or no I want to
invest you know two months trying to
will be smart like one good thing
actually that we discovered right was
the The Vision calculation right because
on a really high performance server you
can distribute Vision Vision calculation
you know on different ways that you can
consider it either a frequency of update
that means you want to update somebody
every second if it's close or if you
have second if it's close you know in
different frequency if they are far but
then after or in the amount of ticks you
can decide right so we had like
something exposed also from you know our
core systems I could say like I want to
update every 30 updates you know but 30
updates and three frames per second is
different than 30 days to 30 frames per
second so we switch a lot to frequency
but even in that case even frequency
means that if you want to do you know an
update every two updates every second
for 100 NPC that are around you
right it's a lot of updates in that
frame but that means that if you have
already afraid it is low it would be
just lower slower right
it's balancing uh there yeah yeah you
said 2 000 NPCs that that's that's
that's spawned throughout the entire
server and stuff uh in the early
versions of C in the first versions of
Siege of wars and that I saw anything
the event alone was spawning seven to
eight hundred NPCs like like and that
was one of the great things about that
event it wasn't just designed to create
new content for the players it was
designed to push to you know to push on
every all the seams of Star Citizen and
to see where we can get them that's and
uh we got the hundred player servers
because of the research that was
necessary of pushing on that stuff we
got all these other improvements but
yeah I think in the end the one that the
version that went live it still spawns
four 400 or so you know NPCs uh during
the course of the entire uh during the
course of the entire event which is a
massive there's my one I'm sorry
everybody but in the meantime people can
also be somewhere else like where they
act debate other locations and there are
other NPC or other missions right that
can still run on the same server so I'm
getting at least I'm getting faster at
catching them
that's good uh uh Sometimes they come
out you know all right that's when I get
that's why that's why I try to be so
even keeled because when I get excited
about something that's when the language
starts changing that's why everybody's
like Derek why are you never hype It's
like because that's how I control my
language when I get hyped the language
disappears too
um
but yeah and and and just to uh to roll
back a little bit uh we're not sitting
here I wasn't saying you're not saying
that that the AI is perfect and the AI
is done and as soon as the servers get
better everything will be fixed you guys
still have a you guys still have a
healthy road ahead of you uh with work
to be done this is the current state of
AI is a is a shared uh State between the
work that your guys still need to do and
still need to push still need to develop
and then the the you know the
performance and the server and stuff
coming into a lot you know that will
continue to allow you to push and
develop that stuff so it's not the
results I think yeah for us I think the
funny or you know the enjoyable part of
our job is also the pretty much you can
continue the forever like you
know you you might never be happy with
the state in which you are right I think
like for example perception you know we
could work on making it faster for a
really long time other things so I think
it's iteration right so we try to for
example I think I'm really happy already
of the stuff that went in Siege of
horizon that it means that it's still
like you know it's not as you said it's
not a leg consideration done I could see
you way far to be done but you know it
was a really good and nice uh step
towards you know a lot of improvements
that we put in and you know it's um I
think you know you need to be also proud
of the iterations right usually people
would see the final game and now they
see a lot of these iterations if you
look right after the attention don't
feel a lot but I think you know it's
also great when you see even from the
communities and comparison from how it
was you know uh 1.5 with a 3A 317 and I
think there's been really a lot of of
Champs you know of the game
yeah uh the uh
sorry somebody Chad said every time
Jared Sawyer is a Starliner gets pushed
back a year and my brain went no
no and I I got distracted
ah
the other thing the other big surprise
uh
something you said touched on this for
me was
how much of AI
is animation
driven like like
how much how much of a believable and
authentic AI some an immersive Ai and an
AI that doesn't just stand out and look
like trash is based in its animations
and its ability to Dynamic quickly and
dynamically
pick between a huge array of animations
and then blend them uh as seamlessly as
possible you mentioned this earlier talk
to me about talk to me how important is
animation in Ai and and do you and Steve
Bender just hate each other yet or uh me
and Steve are great because I think we
also used to work together I mean in
crisis we worked together already across
the street
um and
the animation is like you know a
fundamental part like again like
animation and communication like in my
dialogues like those are what really
makes AI standing out I mean
for me like right there is a lot of
example of good AI you know one classic
one is of course fear where if you think
about how they implement this not even
like
you know the technology itself doesn't
have to be rocket science sometimes to
give you the feeling that those things
are very smart right there was a lot of
really smart crafting of the environment
there it is smart you know set up under
these little designers so that is why I
was saying like the the eyes is the
product of the collaboration of lots of
departments and to make it look good and
make it look believable I think you know
we what we work a lot with Steve for
example is that he is the you know the
person in charge of all this look so
whenever we do in our previous and you
know we always work on iteration and
white box faces and keyframe animation
where they first need to you know what
we what we work a lot is try to iterate
through the gameplay because one thing
is looking good one thing is looking
good for the gameplay because when I
make a movie right all these so I think
sometimes you might create an animation
that looks perfect but anyway you play
the player plays in a way which you
don't even see it or it's not reacting
correctly as you say right it doesn't
you know you cannot blend correctly or
you cannot transition from one place
another reactions is a really important
uh you know
um scenario where
you know you need to have a balance
between the amount of Animation you want
to create to get the believability but
also structuring them in a way in which
it's easier to transition from one to
another that the categories that you
want to play you know make sense for
what you're trying to communicate to the
player
you know and uh you know use different
type of techniques uh that we have so I
think basically for example the
behaviors for my you know take the way
I'm you know I grew up my career uh I
grew up my skills in my career is that
the behaviors is critical is the central
part for the AI to describe the decision
flow decision flow then needs to go into
making sure that you know the decision
flow goes into what any the admission
director wants to show right and this is
where I think you know we have this I
think it always seems of a company when
we talk about stuff but really this
complexity like you're trying to solve a
complex problem complex needs to be
somewhere and I think the critical bit
is making sure that the complex part are
distributed over the ownership of
different departments right so for
example animation director describes the
flow describes the animation State
machine that you want to create how to
transition from one state into another
you know what is allowed to be done and
then the decision flow needs to explain
one day I was to do without you know
padding those two things up too much
because you want to have you know these
things flowing nicely and um yeah so me
and me and Steve work a lot together you
know is is fantastic and misdirect I
mean his experiences is absolutely great
for us you know even just
you know all the things you know we
always discuss and we always you know
want to push so
is this pre-recorded uh that part was
but we just switched alive right now so
I could answer the question now we're
going to switch back to pre-recorded
to mix
uh so you talked about your career you
mentioned your career a lot then let's
let's talk about this
you could do anything in the world
you know it it's it the world is your oh
so you can go and you can do any career
in the world why in the world work in
video games
so for me it's been I could say myself
super lacking super laggy because I
always dreamed to do this thing and you
know I eventually you know been I've
been lucky enough to manage to get it of
course it's not just luck is a lot of
you know uh effort you need to put and a
lot of energy blood and you know and
tear but you also in life you always
need to be you know be like to find
yourself in the right position you know
in the right moment uh but basically
like when when when my dad bought uh
Commerce 64 basically right at the first
well I think it started a little bit
earlier like I was in my cousin place
and he had like a video back that was
kind of a feeling uh you know very
popular in Italy at that time a little
console you know and that is where
Harris I still remember noises I was
probably four but I still remember
nowadays that that feeling of looking at
the screen and I mean this job that was
moving stuff on the screen I was like
wow this is fantastic right and then my
cousin got a Commodore 64 I got a camera
64 and you know I started the program
and I just started to immediate him
pretty much because a lot loved it to do
that and yeah this is where I started a
program right that was probably
seven you know and at that moment there
was no real like in Italy especially it
was not so much about artificial
intelligence per se but you know for me
like it was there were people talking
about it right but there was no computer
science you know studies it was like
electronic engineer so for me I was
always saying like I want to study to
become you know in the track engineer
and then do video games right
um whenever I started yeah those little
uh magazines that that had basic
programs that that you could type
yourself I I started working right and I
would never worked I started on a vic-20
went into O'Connor 64. so we're right
there around the same time absolutely
and and like like the earliest photo I
have like the earliest photo I have is a
baby and then the next photo up is me on
a vic-20 you know learning to read and
write by just
match the symbols match that entirely
that's where that's where my dad put me
uh he was convinced computers would be
the future uh he was right uh I went a
slightly different way but but yeah so
all right
Connor 64. you've started programming
but again things happen junior high high
school girls boys whatever lots of
distractions out there
how'd you get into video games I was I
was quite nerd right so it's like you
know in general it's like you know yes I
did like um my high school was math
based high school you know I started to
computer science engineering uh in Italy
like you have this a little bit of
difference between pure computer science
that is part of the science floor let's
say where you have mathematics physics
you know and then you have engineering
informatics uh that is like yeah the
computer science part of engineering so
I did that one because there was more
specialization about artificial
intelligence that is what I wanted to do
early at the time
and I had the opportunity to basically
when I started to do my master thesis in
Rome and La sabienza
um to also a really good mentors uh one
is also here working with us as Andrea
they taught me a lot about you know
coding about C plus plus and in that lab
we were doing a lot of Robotics as well
and you know with with our professor
we did really it was really exciting
right and uh you know there was two main
you know classes at that time that was
also with Andrea it was like you know
the assistant of the teacher at that
time and we were doing you know learning
and you and Andreas go all the way back
to high school yeah absolutely from
University okay okay University done
yeah it's still impressive but yeah yeah
it's quite a lot a long time and I think
like you know you know yes uh super
strong background a lot of stuff this is
why you know I'm super happy to have
even more because like he is you know
his skills and knowledge about you know
yeah
not just about you know what we do but
even things that we might want to do in
the future right and the more research
topics as well
um but yeah basically we did like a lot
of classes about you know learning about
you know vision
and you know we applied to Robotics and
stuff like this and one once I graduated
I started applying to lots of games you
know video games company and I was
hoping to start with an internship or
something is
and then I got an offer in Rome first
for a company I was being software for
satellites
um so I started there and you know you
get a lot of answers from video games
companies I was like okay I mean this is
just pretty interesting and I started
there and I was C plus plus code so it
was something that I still wanted to do
and then after my first week there
basically got an offer for an interview
with EA for an internship here in
Germany uh you know a country that I
pretty much didn't know anything about
you know at that time but my wife that
time girlfriend uh she was studying us
for you know six months
um uh in New York City uh so she was
doing like an artist in the Columbia
University
and at that time I was like you know it
kind of seems like it's a good
opportunity it's like you know we're far
anyway you know I get those six months
as internship in in Germany and then you
know we both come back to Italy and I
find a game company in Italy
and I was work in the economic I was an
internship for this game was called
battleforge was a RTS game uh based with
cards so it was one of the first year
games that was based on trying
collecting cards but the cars were used
to kind of summon enemies in an RTS word
and that you would just use it as a RTS
uh actually you know real-time strategy
game so it was a bit you know double
things that you you sum on your end you
know your units through cards but then
you know you you actually use them
and um and after that I basically moved
to to critic I got enough from crydek uh
I started to work for the engine
licensing so I was you know hired as an
engineer for the engine licensing but I
think the good thing there was also that
the team was not super big so I had to
learn a lot of the stuff for the engine
in general and I had the opportunity to
work with you know a lot of really
really really talented people uh hi
Kirsten hiring
Carson watches the show I know but I
don't think Carson knows who I am
it could be I've only talked to cars in
like four or five times each time each
time I get the impression he's wondering
who I am and what I had Mark oh you know
Marco is like he's he's one that's been
one of my you know major Mentor you know
synchronic as well and
um Marco knows who I am because he runs
he turns around and goes the other
direction anytime he sees me coming
around the corner so Marco knows who I
am uh you know and I had the opportunity
to learn a lot of stuff like not just
about AI but also you know I I do
you know
I recognize like that the big uh big
chunk of my my knowledge comes also from
learning about other systems you know
um because I think having the larger
overview how things work I think is is
really powerful sometimes and you know
despite the beginning was I mean I want
to do this other thing you know and I
need to fix all this other stuff but you
know it was it was really powerful in
terms of knowledge right and this is I
think it's very classic in the career
where you start as a junior
or as an intern right sometimes you do
like ah but I need to really fix this
bag and you don't really see that when
you study why do I need to study that
product when is this gonna ever be
useful right and then I say oh that's
where I was gonna be useful right stuff
like this so you're in the game industry
now you you you you've worked for a
couple companies you're you're you found
a place a cry attack with with with
people you're you're liking and stuff I
guess
the programmers there's many disciplines
for programmers for engineers uh in
video games
how do you end up in AI well I always
wanted to do AI basically because I I
did like I I come my background as well
outside the gaming is about
I was playing role-playing games right
and for me
the acting right the eye is a lot about
acting right so it's a lot like well we
are in this world action right and I was
like oh yeah hey man how are you doing
right you know so it's a lot about
telling a story and role-playing game is
a lot about playing a story or telling a
story depends what you know if you're a
player or if you are if you're the
master you know a dungeon I mean I
played a lot of dungeon dragons uh I
love like you know a lot of the the
fantasy settings you know I did like
LARP you know I did like a lot of of
nerd stuff uh that I loved it and I
still one you know these are my fun this
memory you know and I started playing or
playing games actually this is the funny
connection with Germany it's my first
role-playing game I played was uh the
dark eye that is a very popular chairman
came because it's a bit simpler that the
Indian in Italy was getting a bit more
popular at that time and I was probably
9 10 you know I was at elementary school
with my best friends and my best friends
all said really a nice shared
um law for those passion for those
things right so I think AI is always
being related to me in a way in which
for video games is the closest to the
tools that you have to tell a story and
to make people escape reality into the
world that
tells the story that they like right and
this is why I've always been a
fascinated by that I've always been
attracted by that
so it's um
yeah it's it's it's the the way that I
have for using my skill to tell stories
to people right that make people live in
a different world uh uh sorry Ray Tango
TV what are you talking about
you just you just you're you're
projecting or something I don't know
what's what's going on
um uh it's interesting uh I'm noting a
couple parallels uh between our pads you
know starting you know with early basic
programming on the c64 it's like this
you know going to uh an academically
driven uh High School
um
being very being very nerdy that's
that's where that's where we diverge
because I
I you obviously excelled in your studies
I went to University and everything I
was counterculture rebelled against my
academic High School I I
literally my my high school transcripts
are are failed and Summer's going fail
and some are because I refuse to do the
work I was I was grunge and Nirvana and
not wanting to do anything I went my
school had a terrible terrible sports
team and it was all very academically
focused and so I didn't want to do the
academics because I was just very
wanting to be contentious and contrary
and I didn't want to do the sports
because they sucked and I had asthma so
I went and created you know created like
a drama club and and did that yeah
because in high school I also did a
little bit of I mean not forever but I
did a bit of theater you know yeah yeah
a little bit name one play One play he
did in high school no it was they were a
place written by some of the teachers
there that they were recalling you know
so I was they were not like full uh you
know real play so it was a bit of a
nerdy strange approach to to theater
right but I was I had fun but you know I
was more close to the role playing than
actually they did it in that case
yeah I know so how was your drama class
we were we were do we were doing like
like Arthur Miller's The Crucible and
being you know dark commentary on the
Salem witch trials and and and and and
just all Dark of the Moon and and and
and and and Children of the heart it
just really
dark melodramatic stuff and then finally
the the last the last show before I
graduated
Annie or for Danny where I was where
where I shaved my head for the first
time it was and was uh uh Daddy Warbucks
which is so weird to me about my life
these days because now there's just more
video evidence than anything but there's
very little we didn't have my family
didn't have camcorders and stuff like
that maybe it's cool you know maybe the
school had it at that time now theater
on camera looks bad like
every handheld videotaping of a high
school play looks a hundred times worse
than the experience actually was now
even if the experience was bad it's
still going to look a hundred times
worse uh when you uh when you when you
see it on uh when you see it on a
camcorder especially
1994 you know era you know VH vhsc you
know you know cassettes
so
all right
you've made it into the video game
industry you've found your calling with
AI and your ability to tell stories like
this you're at you're at you know you're
at crytech you're making you're making
friends Karsten Marco uh Andreas you
know from uni and stuff like this uh
talk to me about how you came to cig
how did that work out I I think at that
time like basically I think there was
the search of some new challenge for me
right something where I think there were
some because I think like after like
during crisis three right we had like a
really nice group as well on my
colleagues you know I had like were for
a high programmers and on crisis three
and then after that I think you know I
really wanted us to try something
something different and I think cig was
a really good place because first of all
there was they come on technology the
base technology that it was used at the
time uh but also I think the project is
just you know way over the top on almost
everything anything right so it's like
there's a lot of everything there's uh
very you know a search for the the best
possible realism that you can achieve
and so on and so on
uh you know that mission was really
large so I think like you know for me it
was just a really good place where to
continue to to just grow with my skill
right because I think you need to always
challenge yourself
and
here I feel like you know you never
challenge yourself and after it's always
like more space to challenge yourself so
I think it's it's a really good place
where I always feel very satisfied of
how much I can learn and how much I can
improve and there is a lot of space
where I can improve and get better right
so uh so so you're so you're
was there an AI team in place when you
came here did you have to build it from
the ground up what do you recall about
those early days so when I joined I
think uh uh a lot of the I was thinking
care through our middleware at that time
that we're using you know when we're
using Catera as a middleware right oh
wow but then I think we moved into
deciding that we wanted to have more in
in-house development right so yes then I
build the team pretty much from scratch
where uh Maurice and Andrea have been
the two first team members you know on
the on the tech side and Janine was our
producer since pretty much the beginning
um and then the team grew up from there
so we were like you know we started with
three people pretty much and we started
to work a lot close with Tony right uh
when we started to move a lot more
development internally where we decided
to really push for subsumption that time
right and then me and Tony pretty much
like you know started to uh you know
crack on implementing all these things
where he made a lot of the external
tools foreign
for a lot of stuff and I basically
pretty much wrote all the runtime code
all the level code up you know how the
graph gets executed the roads you know
runs all the tasks and so and so on and
together also with Mars and you know and
Andreas you know is with this background
he took care of a lot of the ship stuff
especially the 3D I mean we have all
this this really unique approach to 3D
pathfinding and 3D you know uh movement
that Andreas you know has worked on uh
you know Mary's is you know supporting
me on all the navigation stuff since the
the you know URI pretty much and I think
that has been the foundation of the team
and right now I think we are super lucky
because I think the people we have on
board that are fantastic you know yeah
we have some new Juniors that started a
few months ago to start doing like super
awesome you know like they're they're
really really fantastic so I'm I'm
really excited because I think people
will see you know more and more
improvements
because I think how the team has been
growing and now the type of culture we
are trying to push
um that is a culture where everybody
helps each other especially and
everybody tries to share as much as
possible you know the knowledge that she
has we still try to keep you know people
uh responsible specific specific areas
because each other developers loves to
have you know their own expertise in you
know or grow in a specific way because
otherwise you can never be super good at
something right but I think all our
stuff is very shared
you know he pushes for knowledge sharing
but also sharing you know the usage of
the system so that everybody the more
you use it right the more people feel
responsible to to work on on common
stuff and
um yeah it's you know we we build it
from pretty much you know the base uh
from zero to right now we are uh you
know me
Mars Andrea we have two of those
programmer and recording that is like
Michael Madison we have you know uh Fadi
uh that just joined us as our intern
tools programmer uh you know we have uh
Alex uh we have Danielle in UK as well
that just joined a few months ago and
it's fantastic we have Jake we have you
know Jacob uh what we have time Trio you
know that oh fantastic programs I hope I
didn't forget anybody uh I don't think
so but you know we have really really
great yeah the team's grown since the
last time I was I I was able to see him
in person it's hard to keep track over
the last two and a half years with you
know pandemic and work from home and if
you don't have a reason to get on a call
with somebody yeah you can have no idea
they exist uh anymore it's not like you
know the old days or you just walk
around the office and you know introduce
yourself and say hello it's like that
you as you started you got the back half
of those names I was like
I forgot one person is Chris that also
China's recently yes so now I didn't
forget uh but like oh like it's great to
see like how
it's hard to find people to grow a team
in a very you know in a way that it's
not disruptive of course for different
reasons not only because like you want
to grow in terms of skill right you want
to uh give people enough of your time
you know to grow them into their roles
uh but also thinking it's to fit you
know from personality perspective and I
think those guys are fantastic because
they fit both ways you know they feed on
skills but they feed also personality
they are super motivated they're super
excited they're bringing so much to the
table even in terms of you know new
ideas and new you know
um the new approaches well
so
we're we're almost out of time we're
hitting the end here there's a couple
things I I didn't realize you said you
started in February 2015. we started
almost at the exact same time I was
doing some contract work before late
2014 early to 15 uh stuff like this so
they don't count my official you know
full-on full-time employment to like
April of 2015 but I'd been here for a
while so we started around so I'm older
than you in this company well
technically by HR standards yes
I got pay stubs back in 2016. you know I
was trying to stay nice too yeah uh
the persistent Universe the first
version with Alpha 2.0 launched in
December of 2015. so we've been here the
the entire time versus the universe has
existed in the in the in the in the Pu
we talked a bit about
the the the the the
struggle with the server performance and
stuff that that that that that hinders
this a bit uh obviously you know with
with the development of subsumption you
know delayed a lot of things we had to
develop the system before we start
building AIS on top of it stuff the
split Focus between Squadron 42 and pu
has to play some uh way uh some factor
in this this is my very long-winded way
of saying that the AI and the persistent
universe is I I don't think it's we're
not telling any Tales out of school it's
not where anybody wants it to be
absolutely all right it's definitely no
way I wanted it no nobody would believe
us if we tried to sit here and be like
oh yeah yeah I know it's it's great you
know we're almost there and whatever
uh
that's a Sim that's a that's a simple a
simple thing but uh
you're sitting here you're Elite you're
leading this ship you're you're you're
you're you're you're captain of this
ship here
um
how do you think it's going yeah
forget the party line forget you know
you know to take off the cig badge what
not you know
I have more you know inside than the low
level technical thing I think like what
you know we spend a lot of time on this
one and I think we're spending a lot of
time on making sure that some of the
things
because AI doesn't grow in a linear way
I think most of what it does in game
development that's true that's true
exactly like you know it's a classic 80
you know you know 80 and then 20 takes
80 of the time right the last last 20
but I think we are we are still at the
at the point where I think not not
everything we do is actually visible
there not everything is yet live right
yeah everything is is yet there because
you may maybe you have some behaviors
that require some setup and the setup is
not yet there or maybe there are some
things that we're doing for squadron
that we are not yet you know in in npu
there are lots of those improvements or
maybe there are things that are related
to the server mesh I think AI is is in a
way is this is a little bit of a laggy
child of of development because it
doesn't come up together until the end
in a way right but so I think if you
would whatever game you develop right
unless unless it's a sequel of something
you have a very rough experience doing
the development right at least because
of Animation missing because you know
system missing and so on and so on we
are in the middleware we have like a
little bit of Animation music a little
bit of system missing you know a bit of
optimization missing and and you
experience all of this so I think like
the way the way I see it right is like
for example we still have a lot of
behaviors for example in po running that
we want to replace and you know we are
you know and it depends on the resources
you have allocated to to drive that or
something else right so
I'm personally seeing a lot of
improvements right and I'm really
not necessary appreciate but I also a
little bit said that people can need
need still to experience some of the
banks and the promise that we have right
I
I'm not happy about that but I think
sometimes you cannot immediately see
why you need to live with something
right I think people will be happy
anyway when this is out right and I
think there is a little bit of of pain
that you need to to endure now of course
you know there could be discussions I
use this too long not too long it should
be less but the desire to say with
abstraction it's always you know I'm I'm
coming from a scientific background for
me everything is based on data right if
you don't have the data it's really hard
to decide that is this a good decision
or is a bad decision you need to always
balance it
um
but you know I you know for for me of
course like you know I would like to
have at least everything you know people
experiencing you know what at least at
the level in which the servers are when
when they're fresh and you have a good
experience right because I think you
know material the players also are
starting to enjoy that type of
experience despite you know a lot of the
things you know still missing
but for example stuff like you know once
we release the reinforcement right you
see a little bit of things that we are
doing that is really simple and I think
you know yes the you know uh
you have just a regular fixing as any as
any development has unfortunately is
that you know when you release in in our
environment you know you didn't have
that six eight months of only bug fixing
that usually a development has you know
of something that is that is locked
because we are really impacted by a lot
of the change that happens because they
say you know uh persistent streaming you
know like I mean and that one in a way
another impacts us right and he said you
want to fix everything before you
release or you know we have more
unidarity process this is these are a
larger decision that we have to take so
that people can see the progress that we
are things we are doing
so yeah it's a complicated question you
know I think like you know on specific
stuff
um there is also a lot of coordination
between teams and there are things that
you know for example
a lot like what I'm always joking about
is that if people perceive as an ad bank
then it's it's our responsibility 100
right to make sure that that one is
fixed
the reality is that sometimes you know
you have dependencies that you need to
to to sort out to get some stuff also uh
result but it is this is why I think I
like AI so much is that because I really
like to have also this overview of
things that you know
and end up being AI you know and yeah I
know again I'm the first one that is not
you know yeah it's definitely not at the
point where I'm I'm I'm I'm yet proud of
what we have there right but I'm proud
of what we are doing and I know that
what we are doing is the right thing you
know the right direction and I hope like
you know of course my my goal is to make
people experience it as soon as possible
right this type of things yeah I I
I suffer from catchphrase syndrome I I I
have certain sayings I really like you
know the only constant in game
development being changed probably my
favorite my second favorite but I don't
use it very often is a is is it's the
last 90 you know the last ten percent
that takes 90 of the time you said it
you said twenty percent that takes
eighty percent there's always a
variation but it's but it's still a very
famous phrase throughout all game
development it's like yeah it's it's
that last it's that last part that takes
most of the part
um you all you also said you also said
something about how you know it can get
easier when you make sequels and whatnot
I I don't I don't want to throw any
shade out there or or or or or or or or
or give validation to internet rumors
because internet rumors are worth every
cent you pay for them which is nothing
but you know the the the numbers that
we're hearing out there for like Grand
Theft Auto six you know for the time
that's been in the minds it's like it's
like I I
the specifics are important the message
is that this process is hard even when
you're doing you know the sixth Mainline
iteration of a game which is actually
like the ninth or tenth in your entire
in your entire franchise and the
companies existed for 20 30 years at
this point it's just there's no part of
this if you're trying to do something
that nobody's ever done before there is
no instruction manual there there isn't
there is no time estimate that makes any
sense
um sometimes I think like even with the
best intention sometimes you might take
a wrong direction right then you need to
also not be afraid of accepting that
because otherwise you never move forward
if you're if you're like there is this
uh sentence I think that we got in our
package you know welcome of the delphi's
page they will say to not be afraid of
making mistakes because if you don't
make if you are afraid to make mistakes
you don't do anything in life right I I
think I think if we're being completely
honest with everybody and I'm not saying
we as in Sage I mean all people who make
all video games if we're being honest Mo
there's a reason it's called game
development and not game construction
that's because most of it is mistakes
most of it is trying a thing and going
now that didn't work trying a thing
going no that didn't work uh you know
some of them are big and famous like you
know hover mode and stuff like that
stuff but most of the ones you never
even see well yeah most of the ones are
just that's the stuff that's behind we'd
have to do a 24-hour news channel in
order to cover most of it that is that
is a natural part of game development
and and it's it's it's
we try to show as much of that as that
as possible exposed as much of that as
possible without undermining confidence
in the thing but even a lot of other
Industries do that and you just don't
see it right I think there is a lot of
failures in I don't know drug research
right for medical uh you know things and
there is a lot of failures in I don't
know engineering uh you know like space
spaceship engineering research you know
it's not that they get it right always
the first time look at you know so it's
just like normal and I think for us it's
just very visible but it's really cool I
think for people that you know that are
interested even in that
so
we're just about out of time now uh uh a
friend we we I think we've had a a
really nice or really honest or really
opening conversation it's it's the kinds
I I really enjoy
um and this place lets me get away with
it because I love where I work
um but that said
give folks some hope here yeah I'm not
saying this don't give them a date don't
say this is gonna be this or whatever
don't do it again with this but but
I know you well enough to know that
you're hopeful for the future that that
you have a positive outlook on things
share some of that with us why why
should why should we be looking forward
to the future of Star Citizen
I think the experience of Star season
would be very unique you know not just
on the eyesight but on all the systems
right I think like it's uh Star Citizen
and squirrel for you though in general
right there would be a really
you know this is why I'm here like
because my you know my take on the
company and on the project is that those
projects will be you know fantastic you
know to play and uh not only
fantasticity but to read they will give
you some experiences that you will not
be able to experience somewhere else
yeah fantastic isn't necessarily mean
perfect Perfection doesn't exist but it
means that you you know for a lot of
people this would be unique experience
you know when you play the game it would
be similar for me you know the goal is
to have a similar experience that when I
was a child I was playing games right
and it was like I I'm in a different
place I just feel inside me these type
of things and we have a lot of things in
in the pipeline already that would be
released you know slowly into interview
from the work we're doing you know it
doesn't have to wait like you know all
this you know they're finished but you
know we are already in the process too
you know
in the next you know updates there will
be more and more of the stuff we are
working on and hopefully we will do some
other shows where we can go more in
details but you know it's not that it
the good thing here for us is that it's
never like uh All or Nothing it's gonna
be a very you get this when you get this
when you get this one right slowly while
we do it so there's a lot of things
coming hopefully we'll do each other
that's that's the thing for uh uh a
friend there's always a nice show that's
good there's there's there's there's
just there's always the week and then
the week after and the week after and we
don't fit you in this week we'll get to
next week or the week after that of the
week after that uh it's it's this is
definitely a marathon not a Sprint and
stuff like that all right thank you so
much for taking the time out of the end
of your week here to to chat with us to
hang out with us
um folks watching at home uh this is the
uh uh this is the end of the quarter
it's the end of our our quarter three
for for for Star Citizen the the the the
summer quarter for our video content uh
we are uh we're we're taking our little
break now uh we've got citizencon coming
next week which is the on October 8th at
8 A.M Pacific 3 P.M UTC that's gonna
that's gonna kick off our new quarter
four uh of content and uh the journey to
4.0 and a whole host of other things
you're gonna have to tune in uh to find
out uh remember it's a it's a smaller
show this year there's no big keynote
demo or anything with the focus on 318
and getting persistent entity streaming
is this new foundation for everything in
the persistent Universe plus moving to
offices to Major offices at the same
time uh the responsible thing was to
scope down uh citizen con a bit this
year so so remember that and uh when
setting your expectations properly that
said that said you know I am not one
prone to Hype
there's some
there's some of the stuff I'm most I in
my eight years here there are some of
the most exciting developments that have
come to the prison Universe yet in next
week's show so it's it's not going to be
one you want to miss check it out
citizencon October 8th 8 A.M Pacific 3
P.M UTC uh if I'm saying it you can take
it to the bank check it out
uh yeah that's it
I forgot how to end the show I got so
caught up in the citizen gone stuff I
forgot how to end the show
what do I usually say
I don't have enough we'll just we'll
just here we'll just we'll just we're
just gonna hit the thing and just turn
it the boy we'll just turn it to Black
just pretend that the show ended and
that I said something really slick
uh attend the show
that was really cool yeah what did we
learn this week that's for the other
show I don't have I don't have a sign
off for this one
maybe I need one
um
wow
