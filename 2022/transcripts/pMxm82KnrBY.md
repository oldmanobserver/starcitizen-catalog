rivers are more than just water they're
a place to explore
they're a place to find harvestables
that you can pick up
they're a place where everything is
amplified versus the surrounding terrain
and the very first river will be in 317
through the hills of microtech
[Music]
since this time last year we started to
take rivers from what was a pretty tech
demo to something we could release
we thought we were ready to put the
south in 316.
we were pretty happy with what we had
but we still needed some more changes to
bring it ready to put out into the pu
we started by doing a refactor all of
our object scattering so we could have
far more power and far more performance
when we're distributing objects across
the planet
one of the biggest things i wanted to
improve as well was to increase the
density around the rivers but without
increasing the global density of our
objects this was going to be difficult
which led me to work on on-demand spawn
points a system where we can pass a
position to the biome builder and will
automatically scatter appropriate assets
at that location we now procedurally
place on-demand spawn points along the
length of the river and around the basin
one of the major things that we had to
add was dressing presets
and which allow us to
um add specific objects around locations
like rivers and we also had to build the
river mesh from the ground up which
involves spline mesh building which took
a long time
[Music]
that did sadly mean that we missed 316
but it's all the better for it
as we've worked on all of these
different
interactions for the player with the
rivers
for example as of 317 you may now walk
down into rivers and oceans as long as
you are wearing a helmet
you may explore underwater keep your
helmet on you won't drown
you can now drive gravelev bikes over
both oceans and rivers without just
falling through and exploding
we also have harvestables around the
river's edge for you to explore and
collect
we also did a rework of our water
caustic system meaning that there are
water caustics thrown by the river and
its basin
both onto objects above the water like
your ship or trees or rocks and onto the
surface below
planet content team haven't had a full
chance to take a visit of the oceans yet
so while there are assets down there you
can expect improvements in coming
patches
the next big improvement to rivers is
going to be fizz areas so you can throw
things into the river and watch them
flow down
as well as work on the foliage shader
which is going to create more varied and
seasonal foliage
across our planets as well as just the
rivers
in the future what i want is for an
artist to be creating a planet and say
okay i'm happy with the elevation let's
create a river system and for it to be
done and we're not quite at that stage
yet each river is maybe one or two
clicks but it needs to be hundreds of
rivers per planet without even thinking
about it
the river in 317 doesn't have any
missions or qut markers to find it with
so you will have to go exploring to find
it although hopefully this video has
been a help
rivertech is more than just adding
running water to the surface of our
planets and moons it's the collective
gathering of mesh and shader erosion and
foliage traversal over under and through
the surface and it's the harbinger of
things like lava fields and roads and so
much more and up next on this week's
show a look at upcoming efforts to
improve our reputation and hostility
systems in alpha 317 and beyond
we just got done running ninetails
zenna threat
and jump town
you seem to be really enjoying these
dynamic events
you're running bounty missions you're
running assassinations all these things
and we're really excited about that
as a designer it's pretty difficult to
look at these and not see all the little
things that we can do to make this
better to make these notches good but
great and in order to do that in the
near future we're going to be
implementing some new features into the
reputation and hostility systems
with the current reputation system all
of your relationships to npcs are static
that means that essentially you can't
become friends with the the criminals
and you can't become enemies with uh the
law enforcement in addition if you shoot
someone just a single bullet can make it
so that everyone around you suddenly
starts raining hell down upon you and
that can be a pretty awful experience
we're going to be looking to address
that in a multitude of ways
we're going to be looking to have
reputation start driving and hostility
so essentially how npcs react to you and
how you see them
as you become
more and more friendly build up that
affinity with npcs of a certain
organization they will begin to shift
their opinion of you you can actually do
missions or content for nine tails and
if you get to a certain point in their
bar they will stop shooting at you and
start just letting you go by and then
eventually even start protecting you by
the same measure if you start attacking
law enforcement or committing too many
crimes after a certain point uh crusader
security is going to start hunting you
down and attacking you
on site instead of waiting for you to
commit a crime
on the side of making it so that people
don't attack you when you just fire a
single bullet we're looking at in the
slightly more distant future where if
you are in the green zone with a
organization if they really really like
you then they actually have a larger
threshold that you have to break over in
order to cause them to want to attack
you um we want we don't want it to be
global so that players can't abuse it
but we do want it to be something that
is a bit of a benefit if you go and make
friends with these
people in 317 these changes are going to
be largely invisible to players it's
really more about at this point giving
the feature and the tools to our
developers that we can continue building
the content that our players and our
developers really want in 318 and onward
[Music]
this content will enable us to for
instance in xena threat make it so that
you can actually be on the side of the
xena threat instead of just trolling
other players
in addition for jump town this will help
us to sort of patch some of the holes
where players can exploit the system by
grabbing a quick crime stat after
they've already pulled out their
packages and not have to actually fight
people in order to get their drugs
this also enables us to take a lot of
our existing content for the lawful side
and make criminal missions so that there
is actually content in the game for
criminals to do in the long term not
just with these events
[Music]
and of course with additional dynamic
events rolling out in the future we can
start building with this into in mind
from the start this feature will allow
us to say that this event is going to
have this faction versus this faction
and players will be able to be on those
sides in a much more permanent and uh
invested fashion
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that microtech's first river is
the next step forward in the systemic
tools that will allow developers to
bring more texture hazard and
opportunity to star citizen's planets
and moons that the reputation system and
its continuing development remain at the
heart of enabling developers to create
more meaningful and effective mission
content
and that upcoming hostility changes
means maybe i won't get punished so
quickly when i turn a friendly hello
into
accidental unintended friendly fire
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
you
