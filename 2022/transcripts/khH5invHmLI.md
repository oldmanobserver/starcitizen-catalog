## Transcript

and then uh
wait where's this and we're live hi
everybody
uh welcome to star citizen live game dev
making vfx i'm your
host uh uh uh
creative
i forgot my title uh jared huckaby
welcome to the show uh if you've never
seen star citizen live before it's where
we take about an hour out of the end of
our week and we hang out with some of
our developers uh usually the poor uh
unfortunate people that i convince uh to
to stay late on their fridays when
they're trying to go home and do this
with me uh so the this week's victims
are two esteemed members from our uh
manchester vfx team uh we we have we
have mike snowden the the the
the vfx director
say hi mike
hi
and we have leo or what what's your tile
like principal vfx engine programs i
don't remember
yeah principal vfx programmer oh see i
was i was close i was close yeah
close enough
i i literally have anomic of asia i got
diagnosed last year it's like i cannot
hold names so i got an excuse i try not
to use it all right so uh
star citizen live game dev if you've
never seen a game dev before it's where
uh instead of the usual hour-long q a iq
q a we are going to make something uh
with a feedback from the community
we do this to demonstrate process
and show a show a bit about how we work
if you're watching live on twitch right
now you should see a poll at the top of
the chat right now using the twitch's uh
in-house uh poll thing uh if you're
watching on youtube uh later uh sorry
uh our four choices this on this week's
show are terraformer beam uh vehicle
thruster
uh dome shield
and the ever popular explosions
um mike you provided these four choices
and you will be doing the work how did
you narrow it down to these four choices
they just felt like fairly
kind of sim relatively simple things to
be able to recreate in a shortish space
of time and to be able to and kind of
receive
direction from from the people watching
uh yes and it as the uh
the standard disclaimer that we give out
every game dev episode uh very little
can effectively be made in less than an
hour
so remember you are going to see a
truncated uh abbreviated experience here
uh but you know it's still part part and
parcel of open development in the star
citizen process to show how our
developers work and as much of their
process as we can
right now uh it is neck and neck between
terraformer beam and dome shield uh it
was an early lead for terraformer beam
and then dome shield is is coming back i
really thought explosions would have
been uh would have would have been
stronger but i guess you know
everybody's seen explosions
um
leo well we're gonna let this go for
another minute so what does a
graphic what does a vfx graphics
programmer do what which what's your
day like
um we support the vfx team and
yeah just features tools um anything
that
we want to kind of achieve the nice
visuals that artists vfx artists
want to implement
there is quite a bit of bug fixing in
there but also feature developments um
features range from
fire hazard to currently we're also
working on damage maps which is a big
project for the salvage feature um but
yeah there are
are quite a lot of features in the
pipeline that are being planned out as
well
um and then in terms of kind of tools
it's it's like the the particle editor
that mike will be showing
it yeah we we have quite an
extensive particle system and if there's
anything new in there that needs to be
yeah
that kind of the artists want to achieve
then we
kind of talk to them and and try and
implement their
requests i guess yeah
um and mike uh
is there anything in star citizen that
doesn't get touched by vfx at some point
but uh are you
we we talked with the ui guys and you i
guys touched just about everything audio
touches just about everything
okay certain anything you like they
never let us play
we never get to work on that
there's not much i mean i guess
i guess
characters in star citizen there's kind
of less character specific vfx work but
there's still there's still effects
requirements for characters
blurred and
um
eva thruster effects and things like
that so no not not much really there is
a lot of yeah pretty much everything has
vfx in it at some point
so we are going to call that uh it looks
like dome shield uh uh one with 48 of
the vote
so
yeah
where do we start with a dome shield
well because of time constraints yeah
did take the liberty well what i'm going
to do i'm going to i'm going to
depending on what the what people
request and what the feedback is
i'm going to use the particle system to
create the dome
um
so i've said i've started myself and
give myself a bit of a head start but
i'll just quickly talk through what i've
got here
so
um yeah this is this is a previously
placed particle effect which is
uh
i'll just kind of use one of the things
that leo gave us which takes me to the
database so by clicking on this option
here in the particle menu that's taking
me to the to the database which shows
the
that's the library
where the particle lives and
uh yeah i've got i'll switch it off i'll
just kind of pretend
i've started from scratch so
when i drop a particle in from scratch
there's literally nothing there it's
literally just it's just an empty
particle effect
so the first thing i need to do is give
it a positive count so here you can see
i've got a count of 2000
uh if i didn't
uh i'll need to make sure it's enabled
so i'll enable it
i'm also going to set it to continuous
by setting it to continuous it means
it's going to actually constantly spawn
rather than being a burst effect
um so
the reason that this particle effect
itself has actually got this kind of
dome dome shape
uh is because i've got some speed on it
and i've got a gravity scale so if i
switch off the gravity scale
uh the speed is kind of pushing it out
like a disc
and the reason it's pushing it out like
a disc is because i'm using the velocity
direction from the shape
so on its own this effect let me just
switch the speed up as well so first
thing i'm going to see when i make an
effect is it's just going to look like
this it's just going to be like a blob
on the screen
so um
i gave it some speed that's obviously
going up in the wire
which axis is it i always get confused
yeah up in the y axis
um
uh because i've given it an emission
size so emission size is basically
defining like the bounds
of
the effects if i increase that to one by
one
you can kind of see
uh and actually there's a
there's an emission debug draw which
will show what that bounce is
uh
bring that back down was it point one
coming would i even have it set doesn't
really matter
so certainly point one and what i did
was to get that to get it forming that
disc i was using this setting here which
is velocity direction for shape and
that's that's literally just gonna use
the the shape
i guess normals of the of the shape to
to fire it in that direction because i
don't have any
value in in this middle
uh axis
it's it's keeping it basically 2d so
it's like a it's a disc if i give that
point one as well it's just firing
everything out radially
so
um full disclosure there's there's tons
of ways that i could make a dome based
effect i could just use
like you focus on using the mesh
entirely but i wouldn't really get to
use as many of the settings if it did
that it might be a bit more a bit more
kind of boring to to view
um
okay so the other thing that i sorry
gotcha oh no i was gonna say i don't
think it's any surprise that there's no
one way to
build anything in video games that's one
of the reasons we call it development
and not construction it's not it's not
enough to just make a thing you have to
figure out the most effective way to
make a thing you have to figure out the
the most cost efficient way to make a
thing and you have to figure out a way
to make a thing where it works with all
the other things that you've already
made and all the things you ever will
make
lots of considerations
yeah yeah and also playing to the
strengths like i see our particle system
as one of our
real strengths with our with our with
our engine so it's always fun to to use
the the particle system
all right so
it's obviously not a dome at the moment
that's because i got rid of the gravity
scale
gravity scales is is basically just a
multiplier of the actual gravity in the
level uh by default in a test level
there wouldn't be any gravity but i've
got a gravity box in here
i've also got a wind volume but we
probably won't really care about that
for this
so just quickly
get rid of all the debug stuff so
you have to you have to stop me if i'm
whizzing the camera around too quickly
as well because i
i'm aware that sometimes that's a little
bit jarring when people are showing
things
um
so yeah you kind of see the the the
broad shape of it there that that's kind
of working for me scale wise uh this is
kind of i'll jump into game mode in a a
little bit later on but yeah this is
kind of
the player is
it's it's quite kind of tight tightly
conforming to the to the player height
so it's like a player force field okay
so yeah you're thinking like a
deployable dome shield that the pla that
the player could put around themselves
to protect why not sure yeah
why not
um
so
that's yeah that's that's the main shape
that that's kind of me set up now to
really start to be able to to sculpt
this in a way that obviously you could
go in a million different directions for
this from a stylistic point of view from
an artistic point of view
uh
do you want do you want to give me some
feedback should i just freestyle it what
would you like to do jared what do you
need to know
what should it look like
oh you want you want it to
what are options you want colors you
want texture what are you what are you
looking for yeah uh just whatever
whatever people want like what what what
is the thing what what what's the reason
it exists is it is it plasma is it
is it is it kind of is it something more
kind of um
like more like digital
there's so many things that we can do
i'll just give you a quick example okay
so at the moment there's no texture on
each particle it's just a black it's
just a black square if i just drop
my old faithful um
glow particle set it to additive
uh this is in the appearance
settings so i'm using a texture now
whereas before there was no texture
assigned to the quad each particle's got
got that got that square
uh i'm gonna whack on some emissive
lighting
and i'm gonna i'll just crank it up
actually
so this is this is this emissive
lighting isn't it is measured in knits
so it's kind of technical
physically based within within reason
but if you see that
kind of glow that we get now um i'll do
even crack it up even more
just done another one but i don't know
sorry why not
so now we've got something that's
looking much more like there's energy
coming from that now it's looking a lot
more like it's some kind of
like a missive energy source
although it's obviously looking a little
bit a little bit blobby because it's
just these
these dots and for those who are
watching live at home uh what you're
seeing is the zoom delay uh more more
data information going through zoom and
zoom tends to
tends to crap out a little bit so
yeah that's a good part i mean
anytime you see
particle effects fast moving effects
uh compression and streaming can kind of
struggle a little bit um so i'll drop
that emissive down because that's that's
obviously affecting the exposure so one
of the things that i mentioned you'll
see that the brighter the the the
um the effects that that exposure is
kicking in so it's darkening and
everything around it so
i could actually use the lighting
toolbar to clamp that
do you remember that the dome shields
from
from phantom menace the ones that the
the gungans used
i do i do um because we
we recreated them
uh in a game that i made a former
company
you think we could pull off something
approximating
that
before i volunteer you for
something we could we could try it but
the thing with that is it's more like
that would that's almost like a kind of
like almost like a
i think of it like sort of per lesson
it's more like i think that would be a
mesh based approach so that would
probably work that's right that's fair
that's right we could we can we can
maybe try it later on if i get time
because i do have an actual
uh sphere mesh that there's a kind of
backup that i was going to use
um okay i feel like i'm kind of rambling
and i'm not really making much progress
here so would you what do you want to do
joe do you want to just start kind of
noodling away freestyling let's go to
digital
digital okay you you said that earlier
what what make what makes a shield look
digital
so typically for me it's more like you
sort of emphasize the pixels and and
that that kind of thing so i'm just
going to go straight to uh
just go straight to a square texture
what can i use
just stay in the flow folder
uh as for people who in the chat are
asking are you actually going to do dome
shields for the game that's a question
for designers
uh who who make gameplay decisions and
then send them over to
vfx people and saying now you need to
make this
so uh yeah
the answer is we don't know
not the folks here on this show
if someone want if if a designer decides
they need it for the game then we'll be
ready to make one for them no problem
okay so dead simple thing i mean i'm
just using like a square texture so for
me that's instantly like my mind is
reading that like sort of pixel pixely
kind of thing so
it's a very very simple change i've
obviously changed the color as well uh i
feel like that's already reading a bit
more digital than it than it was before
yeah
um linear two says alternatively the
gameplay designers watch the stream and
go we need this let's go that has
happened more than once
that has happened more than once
yeah not necessarily that the thing we
made on stream is what gets me in the
game but the thing that we make on
stream that inspires an idea that that
then turns into something else so let's
just let's just say i i i i keep a
little list
uh in the back of my mind of all the
things that are in the game because of
some dumb idea that started with some
dumb thing i did
and it's growing
i'm very pleased with that list
so
what i've just done is i've just set the
time scale to zero basically just frozen
the effect in time and i just wanted to
kind of show um
kind of cheating a little bit here
because i'm using a i should just
i am quite lazy i'm being honest
um you already said you're a dragon no i
am i mean no i i i
i'm always looking for like the easiest
way to to do a thing because then if i
can do it more easily then i can do it
more quickly and then i can do more
things so
the fastest route
to the to the point i'm trying to get to
is my favorite one um so what i've done
here is instead of just finding like a
much crisper square texture which we've
definitely got
although i kind of glaze over sometimes
when i'm when i'm when i'm trying to
find things
uh against the clock i'm like oh my god
i can't find it so uh
you can see here like it's the kind of
glow is built in yeah i mean that's
that's actually pretty i quite like that
you know that but if i was trying to if
i was thinking again staying on the kind
of the digital theme i i want it to be
crisper so what all i'm doing here is
i'm using the alpha erosion setting that
we've got
and that's essentially like eroding
the
uh leo d is there like a more or
technical description i'm just going to
say it's like eroding the alpha so it's
so it's clipping away that the the alpha
the index
of that alpha in the texture um yeah
which is that yeah it's basically
clipping curling
based on the alpha value of the texture
yeah
it's quite a cool technique actually
it's very very very common one as well
in
vfx
that was a happy accident i don't know
if you saw what i just did then that was
pretty cool
i said it i set the time skill to minus
one
and it reversed time
does that work
shouldn't do but it does look at that
we've been able to track view that happy
accidents
that's amazing cool all right um
chad is saying that you know at some
point we need to add a trail effect
a trail effect oh what a trail to each
each pixel yeah it's like so we we can
see where they where they were as
they're moving along
it's a great idea like little
here's what we're comets to do then
we're going to make a child particle
so the child particle i'm going to use
just going to drop this down
so i'm going to use another another kind
of
lazy lazy tricks not really lazy this is
just good a good good practice we've got
an inheritance option here which is
which is
by default is set to system
um
i'm going to use parent inheritance on
this child particle what that's done is
that that child particle is now
inheriting all the properties from the
parent
uh i can now override
if i make changes to the parent the
child will inherit all them changes just
just by default
which is great like if you
i still see it actually with with the
vfx i swear there'll be you'll have an
effect that's got kind of three four
maybe more
children hierarchy and they're all kind
of similar that this kind of needs to
sort of roughly match what the parents
doing
um but they're not using parent
inheritance so it's a bit more of a
manual process each time they make a
change to the to the parent they've got
to
do the changes manually to the child so
i'm
using parent inheritance what i'm going
to do is i'm going to override
the count of the child what i'm going to
now do is put this back up to 2000.
this child has got a count of 1
i'm then going to set it to uh
spawn i'm going to change the spawn
excuse me the spawn settings of the
child
to be from parent birth
so
so what's happening now is i need to
just zero out a few settings it's a
little bit ironic because i'm saying
about like i wanted to inherit all the
settings but i'm actually going to get
rid of a lot of them so i'm killing
uh
the speed and gravity scale this might
just might kind of in in zoom at the top
in the top of the page at the top of the
window mic there's an option to optimize
for video it takes the resolution down
but it gives us a little more speed
yeah i don't see you guys anymore
because it automatically gets rid of
doesn't it
uh
that definitely changed go go back to
scene let me see it there
how does that look it's smoother but
it's it's less detailed and that's also
that's always the trade-off with zoom
yeah yeah yeah well i'll stay i'll stay
with this if people want me to kind of i
don't know if you want to like do time
scale zero every now and then just kind
of see how it looks in a single frame
then i'm happy to do that um that's no
this looks bad and we can't read the
screen anymore let's go back
we can't read what you're clicking on
anymore
okay uh
you know when
once we've returned to office once we're
all there and all in the same place we
won't have this issue anymore
you'll just be sitting right next to me
on a computer that's right into the
stream computer and
it'll be awesome
someday indeed i think
uh one quick thing i just did then as i
said the texture shot and i've done it
on the child and the textures set the
texture sharpness to one which will just
re-emphasize it that'll just that
basically puts it to the it changes the
the mid map
uh the the lowest map it sets it at the
highest possible uh texture quality i
guess so that'll just keep it crisp and
sharp uh right okay so
making it what am i doing making a trail
owner so i'm gonna give it i'm gonna
give the child a count off let's just do
10 for now
for people in the chat asking when
questions
the answer to all when questions is
always the same
when it's ready
so this is doing some weird things i've
got to debug this slightly this looks
good too you guys know better
is it spawning
so i've got a lifetime
i've got a light so i need to just do a
little bit i need to just step back and
just think about what i've just done
so it's spawning
it's like it's like it's like well that
kind of looks cool
there are
there can be happy accidents quite
frequently when you're working with
effects because there's so many
different combinations you don't always
expect
excellent i think i know what's
happening it's is it the
so
it's spawning every
like every second after the particle
response and because every second is
always at the same distance from the
original point you get these rings where
the child particles spawn
i think i need to just tell you what i
need to just i'm going to change the i'm
going to change the color
right the actual vfx is screaming and
screaming at me another what are you
doing like it's so obvious what's gone
wrong um
it's not gone wrong it's just it's just
doing a thing
so uh we have a running gag on seo where
people forget their names like if if
if people can forget their names in the
heat of a live show where you've got the
pressure
you're allowed to forget what a
what what a variable
i almost use my one swear right there
i almost use my one
leo i'm gonna i'm gonna risk
that weird flickering issue i'm gonna
use
trail segments on the child to make it a
proper a proper trail
if this is gonna work living dangerous
mike
i don't think it likes it now it looks
like a lady gaga wig
let's just try
i'll do that do you know what i'll tell
you what i'm quickly gonna do
i'm gonna quickly
see you later red wolf one
it's not a train station you don't have
to announce your departure
that's cool
people are people are switching off
so
all right test i'm going to snap that
yeah
out the way
i'm going to give that
give that texture
okay see that was weird see what i had
to have to do then was it it wasn't
showing up and i was thinking why is it
not sure enough i had to reload the
entity for it to actually appear
um
so what i'm going to do now i'm just
going to i'm just going to prove that my
very simple parent child hierarchy is
actually
valid and correct and isn't isn't
isn't causing me more problems so the
more complex you go with the effect and
the more you try and change it when it
goes wrong that's when it becomes really
difficult so it's always good to kind of
sort of extract
um
like part of what you're trying to do
and just sort of just make that more
simple to to debug so this is my parent
i'm going to make a child for this
excuse my terrible naming conventions
um
set that's continuous
folks who might remember
yay old days i remember uh
atv in
2016 that
had a terrible naming convention seen on
screen
about 40 times
that
we learned to zoom in when we captured
gameplay footage after that
so your naming convention is fine
this guy needs to make shield noises
[Music]
of course
not too much
this yeah so it's working the trailer is
working
um
how strange
so the green particle
is the trail
if i just give it a much shorter life
yeah
give it a bit of i'll tell you what
negative speed
yeah bizarre
there you go it's like a little
little tiny kind of mutual can you just
turn this into the dome now
well
i'll just copy this
right scrap it we're not going to worry
about the trails for now because it's
just gonna i'm just gonna lose myself
uh i'll tell you what i'm gonna do i'm
gonna use
segments on the parent effect itself
and that will just
hopefully do what people are asking it
to do so that's kind of showing
hopefully that and again is this because
of the
compression but um
what i was trying to do before was use a
child to trail because that would have
given me more options more i could have
done some more cool things with the with
the trailing effect but what i've got
here
is um
go inside it for a bit
i'm using our
we've got ribbon and motion trails
trail segments this is sort of like a
an approximation of a motion trail
as it were
um and you can obviously change the the
the length of time the trailer last one
that looks kind of
i don't know we're back to another lady
gaga wig now
yeah there's a lot a lot of the more
lady gaga references and i was expecting
to be honest
i have multitudes man
uh can i just can i just do a thing can
i just
it's just
yeah okay
just gonna
um
oh sia would be more accurate skydancer
good call
that was much more ceo wig than a lady
gaga wig i stand crazy
right i'm gonna
i'm gonna use uh spawn at
parent death on this child
oh wait no no what's up sorry set that
back to one
set list of parent inheritance
uh
set this count
to two
get back
to 2000 on the parent
whoa
okay
oh yeah
like straw hats
what did you say like a straw hat
yeah
we just illustrated the difference
between you and i leo
if there was a straw hat in star citizen
i i know full well that you'd your
character would be wearing one leo
yes yeah yeah definitely
all right quick explanation of what i've
just done so i've i've used
uh i've used parent and title no sorry
wrong i've used the parent and child
hierarchy again what i've got in this
case is i've got
the child
spawning when the parent dies now as it
happens i've just got the parent
um
it's not car i don't know anything i've
just got it set so it kind of roughly
dies
i'll just drop it down a bit in fact
yeah oh yeah yeah see i've gone too low
so it's basically the parent is is dying
and when it dies there's a child
particle that's getting spawned from
that and then the child is it's because
i've used parent inheritances it's
inherited a lot of the settings from the
from the parent which is actually quite
again like a happy accident i wasn't
really
expecting that almost like doughnut uh
formation to come from them it's because
i've got velocity direction shape
take that go ahead and switch back to uh
optimizer video
okay
uh
yes
how's that
it's a reminder to folks watching at
home uh the
frame rate issues or with zoom not with
the editor or the engine or the
workspace or
microsoft oh yeah yeah don't
don't worry about that the the threat
the frame is absolutely fine you can
stay in this mode for a little while
okay
right okay we now know what everything
says
i'm gonna just tidy this up a little bit
i'm gonna reduce the size over the life
the riyadh will see the direction shape
what is this this is the new sombrero
shield that's coming in out the 318.
go make a write a thread
right
so now we're starting to what what i
really want to do i i feel like i have
gotten a little bit sidetracked i want
to kind of start layering this up i want
to start adding complexity to to the
effect and one thing i've just done
there is i've checked i've checked color
well z buffer option in in the collision
section which uh backers will be well
aware we've talked about this a lot of
times this means the the particle now
actually collides
with the with the floor in this case
it's colliding with the zebrafish
specifically but it's now kind of looks
more natural it's even though it's a
very unnatural looking effect
uh it's colliding with the flow
it's
about the sombrero
uh i'm gonna just set this to
thanks
um
would anyone mind if i drop the trail
time down
i feel like with the trail it's lost
that kind of digital yeah this looks
more digital yeah i just got the digital
look back
yeah just gonna quickly save um
so they're free facing now i've set them
to free facing before they were camera
facing
and with it being camera facing it the
the the quad is always twisting to to
face the direction of the camera when
you're making kind of a digital effect
that can look a little bit too random
you want you kind of want the
the squares to be
like aligned as it were
so i'm just going to leave them as
free-facing because i feel like that
that that works better for the digital
theme that we're working with um
right so back to the
sorry no somebody put moo bot in the
chat
robots trying to shield for the game get
out of here mobot
i don't know what that is
um probably left over from the battle of
the bricks go away nobody likes you
right something i just quickly did was i
i used i've set the parent
to
be colliding with the zeb buffer as well
now so that means if i increase the life
of the
parent
it's
it's now physically colliding
but what's happening is it you can't
kind of see that child spawning
frantically like it was and what the
reason for that is
that
because i've got child collision
spawning when the parent dies
the parent is alive for longer so it's
colliding the parent is and it's just
hanging around which kind of looks quite
nice because it's created this this this
nice kind of shape and form um but
you're only kind of occasionally seeing
this little kickback of these these
particles the children kind of kind of
like that it's quite quite yeah yeah
yeah cool yeah
um but what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna
change the spawn options on the child to
spawn at parent collide so now
this just works kind of it's a bit more
kind of robust now
uh just go back into f11
so every time the parent collides it's
spawning the child and what you see if i
just drop down below
the this because it said before
collision there's no there's no mesh
there now there's no zed buffer kind of
information there so it's just going to
fall continually down
um
but that's kind of a side note really so
now i have a challenge for you mike
okay can the color change
along the way i can start out blue like
this in end
hot pink
great choice great choice of color
always hot pink if in doubt yes it can
that's that's that's the happy answer so
um
just gonna use
oh look i've just found leo i've just
found a bug
did you see that okay
coffee coffee color paste
color into key and it doesn't
doesn't like it i mean it's a nice color
but
it's not what i asked
yeah
put it on the back clock
oh okay so
let's go let's find a nice yes yes i
boot i i banned moobot nobody gets to
chill for star citizen in my stream
except me i'm the only chill here
um
so
so what's happening here is uh oh hot
pink we said helping
there you go jared
so the parent this is oh this is this is
the parent now starts blue
turns pink now what what i need to do
is i need to edit the child because it
doesn't make sense that the child is
following that exact same color
scheme on its age because it should be
the other way around really can i
i'm going to swap it come on let me do
it yeah
i'll just cheat the engine
um
i've done the reverse
in fact i'm just gonna keep hipping so
yeah yeah
that that's a better match now because
obviously what's happening is the child
is spawning when the parent collides you
kind of want that to be
roughly equivalent
depending on what you've what you're
going for visually but yeah that's got a
bit of a kind of uh
like synthwave neon thing going on now
isn't it good good choice good direction
like that
um
okay
i'm just gonna i'm just gonna
just slightly noodle away at the z
buffer options if you want to give me
any more kind of
feedback or any other requests feel free
to but i'm just going to play around
with some of the
elasticity options
on these children
uh how can i get them
i guess one of the cool thing with the
collisions is that if you were to put
like a different
object underneath like the line would
kind of follow the objects
we have to see this yeah
right in that case it's going to drop
oh there let's just go knobs let's just
let's just
why are they so big
okay right now that's pretty cool
um
i'll just re-introduce the chaos
of the
velocity direction shape
pop that speed back up
okay
i'm going to save i press f11 for full
screen mode i'm going to
go into game mode and it's not going to
crash
all right so
here we go
oh see that
that coming through okay yep
gives a little more profile there you go
slowly walk through there we go
like the t-1000 through jail bars
i suppose it was psychiatric ward bars
so this guy's just got digital rain
coming right at him
so yeah that's that's what we get from
the zebra for collision again i
appreciate we've shown this this before
but um
it it's it's kind of yeah i think we've
gained like 300 000 new citizens since
the last time
so
it's always new
yeah good that's good
um
so i'm cranking up the count this does
obviously make the effect more expensive
just a quick quick note on
for anyone who's noticed the the color
of the icons changing to red what that
means is
by default
this might be where i let you talk talk
the science leo but by default our
effects are deterministic
and
in very very simple terms that just
means they're they're kind of more
optimal
cheaper to to have in the game
certain things i will do to certain
settings i will add to an effect will
cause it to become non-deterministic
and
that
can be more expensive
there's more
there's more kind of uh
information that the engine needs to
know about
um
so yeah it can become quite expensive on
the pfx update cost in particular on its
own just just doing one thing like i've
done here isn't going to kind of break
the game at all
from the point of view of efficiency but
this red color change indicates that
it's now become non-deterministic it's
not always obvious why it is it's not
it's sometimes you'll make a change and
it's like oh yeah yeah i forgot that
that makes it non-deterministic
um leo is there anything you want to add
to
that
yeah it's it's kind of various reasons
but like the main difference is that
like deterministic particles is a at any
given time during the lifetime you will
know the exact states of a particle so
position and all those kind of things so
if you say
at five seconds you know like the
particle will be at
an exact position while for the
non-thermic to non-deterministic
particles we kind of
the state changes from frame to frame
but because it's more random or there is
some yeah some thing affecting it over
frames like the the state and the
position will not always be the same uh
at five seconds so it's
non-deterministic in the sense like we
can't determine like the exact states
over the lifetime of particle
do
yeah
i know so much in
game dev is bound by draw calls and
stuff do do vfx
have the same
uh restrictions in that regard
yes
um it's a little bit out of my knowledge
sphere
but yeah in essence they they kind of do
it's a it's a little bit out of point as
well being completely honest that's
where we're going to go to the graphics
stuff and
yeah and and hopefully you know gen 12
and
after that vulcan
can free us up from these draw call
limits we've currently got
just i was just while leo was was very
eloquently talking i just thought maybe
i could just try and
tidy up that that very obvious kind of
central point where where this is all
spraying out from uh
i don't know if i want to kind of noodle
around with it too much but
there's various things i could do to
tidy that up only one d shot says
where's the emitter that's on the props
team
oh we'll see what see what he means yeah
because when you say admit i mean in the
engine terms that that's the metaphor
the physical thing in terms of the law
yeah um
that'll be a little bit out of that's
another team
yeah
yeah um all right what should what shall
i do next
[Music]
you've only got 15 minutes
um
oh my goodness yeah yeah uh uh uh what
what what do you think you can turn this
into instead of starting over brand new
uh i feel like i wanna
do i wanna kind of have it powering up
could i do
would that would that be easy to do in a
short space of time
like if i just weren't
oh yeah i know what to do
could this be used to make hair maybe
for a hologram character sure
we already accidentally made some
hairstyles earlier
uh
yeah so here's here's a kind of that's
not let me just do that keep that also
quite like
quite like what that does what if he had
what if he had a thruster effect coming
in from the side and how would the
thruster effect
interact with the
oh don't you well
well
uh
do you mean because it's like like with
the wind affecting the
or particle colliding with particle
well let's just try
see this will work uh allie brown if we
i'm sorry marco if we crash the engine
it was my idea it wasn't mike's
mark who is um have you ever played
football with marco no
he's so good
let's just make that square
this might not work so the full
disclaimer is that this this definitely
uh
definitely might not work
it's really because
d-shot that's a question for game design
and not bfx vfx are visuals as far as
what their purpose and intention and how
they would
what they would and when it deflected
all that stuff that's that's
stuff determined by other teams
i like how i'm kind of getting here it's
probably not coming through because of
the resolution but i like how i'm
getting occasional glint see that leo
something yeah
and that's again that's just yeah it's
kind of it's kind of not intentional
that's just because it's free facing and
also because of the temporary
anti-aliasing uh one thing that i
normally do when i'm making uh like
really small particles is enable
responsive a which which does that see
the difference there
that's quite significant um
yeah when we when we when we changed
over to the temporal anti-aliasing it
actually caused quite a few problems
with the particles but the graphics guys
and engine guys gave us this responsive
aa option we can also use them in pixels
as well
i said that's a two
so what that'll do
uh
yeah yeah so
i mean pixels can actually just keep the
keep the particle a minimum pixel size
on the screen regardless of how far you
away from it you are so if i just did
something really silly like that
it's forcing each particle to be a
minimum of um
what did i put it 100 100 pixels now i
can't i can't count how many pixels are
on this viewport
uh
maybe you can do that leo it's got a
ratio of
1894 to 1351
um
yeah let's uh ask someone in the chat
maybe with the calculator
oh some folks are saying that actually
look cooler that way
well i mean exactly so there's so
there's ways that
there's ways that we can kind of exploit
it you know it's kind of oh gosh that's
ruined
okay ruined
saved it's all right just i just think i
incurred a huge overdraw cost then
because i set the pixel size so the pit
the particles basically like full on the
screen but because there's what
there's four thousand well there's more
than four thousand there's there's
there's four thousand plus
uh two spawning every time those four
thousand particles collide so all of a
sudden then i was absolutely killing the
the overdraw
um
i was gonna do a windfalling wasn't that
yeah
let's kick the
window
uh okay
let us find it where did i put that with
diary so that is
what are you trying to do with the wind
volume
oh you're gonna tell me i can't do it i
was i was going to see if it would push
the particles if i use wing scale
uh
it will
if
well it will only work if if um for the
whole emitter writes rights
it won't work for only like a part of
the particles yeah yeah yeah it's not
gonna yeah i appreciate that it's not
gonna like punch a hole in it per se
um
i think it's because i've got another
one volume in the scene that's
yeah you can kind of see that there it's
kind of
a skew
yeah right
yeah and that's because
why is that one
uh where is my switch that off
i think i need to reload the entity
yeah
that was it okay so
uh
debug options where where can i
should i be able to
see the
yeah you need to reload the wind volume
as well i was just uh before this
stream
i was playing around with it's well it's
not the most intuitive
okay
okay so i don't think this is going to
like be as cool as i i had hoped it
would be but it yeah so if i increased
it so do i have to do that every time
that
yeah
i think so
set it to if i set the speed to 200 i've
got a reload
and then i've got to reload
what am i going wrong earlier what's the
is my direction wrong
physics guys will be
shouting now
not entirely sure to be honest here
yeah if you want to code for it's
uh that was leo not me okay
let's do it you got eight minutes left
oh god so stressed
out
come on
just open there are names in here
uh
rollo says that used gen 12 uh if you
follow along with the monthly reports uh
that are released every month uh on the
broader space industries.com website
rollo uh you'll know that uh
gen 12 is not like a one thing it's like
it just goes in and then it's suddenly
in it's parts and parts and parts and
parts that have been added and
implemented into various areas over the
last uh most of the last year
so
that's a much more complicated question
to answer than
just yes or no
the answer is both
whoa
whoa what did you do so that's that's
not the that's not part of the effect
that's that's the vector field that i've
dropped in um what i'm gonna have to
quickly do
can't believe you
you asked me to do this leo
outrageous
i know
but look
look how cool it starts to look already
i mean
all right so
quick quick uh quick explanation there
so what i've done is i've dropped a
particle field entity into the into the
scene we've got two
two options with particle fields with
some right we've got sign distance
fields we've got vector fields i'm using
the vector field it's a pre-created one
um the the texture format is it a 3d
texture i have a question of its 3d
texture yes yeah exactly yeah so this is
uh occupying if i bring the bounds back
on so within this bounding box the
vector field exists draw advanced
is
how does it come through does it come
through it's basically
the direction so it's it's so it's a bit
like uh how would you describe it leo
well i'll let you
let you describe it
a 3d grid with like each cell in the
grid having its own direction
does that make sense
it's a storm sounds good
yeah
um
and so the directions for each each cell
can affect the
particles which are inside the same cell
so there is a link between the the grid
and the particle system so the particle
system can react to the
directions it's it's less digital now i
have to say it's
when i wake up
yeah i mean i don't know what i don't
know how would you even describe what
we're what we're drawing now
stranger things something take take
mike take the volume
and the the the the scf and move it half
in and half out like
so so we can see it affect half of the
oh yeah see you see it do all kinds of
weird stuff now
slide a little more
it's good so now we can see what the
volume is doing
you see the volume so on this side
yeah it's like
absolute chaos on this side and the
reason i'll just bring it down again i
increase the strength multiply of the
actual vector field itself
um
one actually one quite nicely means like
what we could what we weren't able to do
with the wind volume which i think is
what we were hoping to do
was um
like pass the wind through
but we can do that with a vector field
so now that the
now that the bounds are
kind of smaller than the the thing
smaller than the effect itself it's kind
of you can see it influencing as it
passes through
especially if i increase it again
strength multiplier
just kind of slicing through and
disrupting the
disrupting the particle flow as it goes
through it
uh
vector fields and sine distance fields
kind of there's a lot of
a lot of things that we can do it kind
of it helps us to kind of be more
creative with the shapes and the motion
of the effects that we make
yeah actually it's interesting if you
look at the the floor there like you can
really see when i'm sliding it across
kind of see it was dragging through
that's interesting
oh because the child particles al also
gets affected i guess
yeah because i've got parent inheritance
yeah yeah
oh wait the core one isn't yeah but the
chart yeah the child is is affected by
the vector field
um
shall i i'll just jump into how we're
doing for time oh two minutes
okay
so let's get the
camera out a bit
so leo uh can you think of some creative
ways we're using vector fields in in the
game at the moment
yes uh the
atmospheric entry effects um are a very
nice example um
it's it's it's one of the it's kind of
an interesting
or that's not the vector fields actually
it's it's that's the sdf um
yes sign distance field um in
i think in one of the engine rooms which
one was it was it the reclaimer
we got it we got a few actually the the
vector field i'm using and this is is
one of the engine room uh vector fields
yeah
yeah and so
it's
basically the particles will follow the
shape of the room so the vector filters
has been created from the geometry in
the room and so
anything that's in the room will kind of
make give a little bit of a sense of
wind inside the room so that it doesn't
kind of just
drop on
everything it will kind of flow away a
little bit
which is yeah
good use for this
definitely
uh all right
so so so one one last thing mike
can you just like
put your face on the keyboard and roll
it
my face
on the keyboard
so it happens my actual face
i know what will happen
i'll look really silly
forever because it'll be immortalized
in a video i tried everybody all right
thank you mike and leo for taking your
time uh at the end of the week and and
and showing us i think uh uh besides
just how cool and
inventive vfx vfxr i think it was an
excellent demonstration of why we call
it
uh game development and not game
construction you don't go into a thing
with
blueprints
and engineering and all this stuff like
oh we're just following the instructions
and making the thing on on the paper
right it's game development is about
exploration and about uh testing things
and happy accidents so
many
happy accidents throughout all of game
development stuff
and this was a very good demonstration
of of principles that apply to
everything
a lot of it is you go in and you see
what happens
and uh you're going with a plan i mean
you always have a plan but mostly you
allow for discovery and stuff oh what
are you doing now with the with the
thing hold on
uh sorry i was just totally
you're pretty styling while you were
you're going crazy
all right so
that's it everybody thanks for thanks
for hanging out uh with us on this
week's star citizen live um
if you haven't already uh check out uh
inside star citizen this week uh with a
look at uh two recent additions to
racing one that just went live in the
recent alpha 317 two uh the snake pit
which is a racetrack inspired by you the
community and uh the upcoming uh uh
orizon arena racetrack coming in uh
alpha three eight three eighteen that
was also inspired by a lot of really old
and long-standing requests from the
community and
and both of them are fantastic examples
of
just a single developer uh finding time
between tasks and going i i gotta wait
for a little bit for this person to get
ready for this and for this resource
we're ready i wanna keep busy and being
inspired by the community and making
some very fun things
very happy accidents uh that go into
star citizen so check that out and then
we will be back with isc next week
for an entire sprint report episode uh
i'm still i'm still writing it we're
still putting it together i don't know
what's going to be in it but it will be
a 100 percent all oops all sprint report
four uh they don't happen very often but
it's happening the next week so check
that out uh
destruction that's mike
that's leo i'm jared thanks for hanging
out with us uh a star citizen and uh
we'll see you next week everybody take
care
see you
see you
we love you santa claus santa claus me
i'm gonna have to
get a haircut and shave soon
you
