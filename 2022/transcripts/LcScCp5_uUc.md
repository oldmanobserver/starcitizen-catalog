[Music]
hello everybody welcome to star citizen
live game dev colonialism outposts i'm
your host jared huckabee and we are once
again uh in my home welcome to my home
uh here in
manchester united kingdom
uh on if you've never seen star citizen
live uh before it's where we take about
an hour out of the end of our week
and
we do stuff uh sometimes we we do q and
a's where we answer questions and put
our developers on the spot like last
week's uh show with the graphics and
engine guys
and other times we take us through take
you through our process uh show you a
bit about how we work uh and uh usually
make fun of somebody while they do it uh
that's what we're doing today
uh with members of our esteemed uh
modular content team let's bring them on
here we've got uh joel say hi joel hi we
got cairo
hey everybody
and eddie
hello
eddie why are you in like four threes
penance again
i do not know
it's like watching an old vhs i'm pretty
sure my webcam is 780p so i'm not sure
why i'm uh yeah four by three it's
reminiscing yeah yeah yeah better times
the nostalgia thing it's like we rented
you from the blockbuster we're just
watching you on an old school vhs yeah i
need some scan lines and stuff so
uh
the modular con is that still the
modular content because i know there's
been some reorganization we sort of dub
ourselves the sandbox one team these
days um yeah because we have multiple
sandbox teams so yes but we are
responsible for these slightly
smaller more modular
um and things that get scattered all
over the place kind of content rather
than the sort of more bespoke landing
zone content yeah
and uh your job on the team what what
what's your title and what do you do
eddie
uh i am senior lead on the team so um
yeah i um organize things and make sure
everyone's happy and try my best to get
things out for
when uh when we need them out
essentially
uh cairo this is your first video for
star citizen either pre-recorded or live
welcome to the show who are you
what do you do for
uh yeah i'm cairo i'm an environment
artist too i just joined the team in
january and i'm all the way here from
south africa so yeah it's been a good
time enjoying it and i will say cairo
has been killing it since pretty much
day one so
you started in january you said
yeah i think i got your new year's day
started on the 10th something like that
we
we actually legitimately have a
six-month moratorium period we usually
don't have people on the show in the
first six months we don't we try not to
scare them away basically it's it's it's
not official it's a deal that i have
made with all the leads and directors
that i won't scare their new hires away
in the first six months uh by going that
but uh so we're skirting that just a
little bit but i appreciate you being
here um and then uh joel uh no stranger
to star citizen uh uh videos uh
citizencon isc seos before but it's it's
somebody's first show so who are you
what do you do for star citizen
yeah i'm joel i'm a senior environment
artist too on the sandbox one team
and i just do the art and i do level
setup
and i just do the art
yeah just do it
that's simple
i mean yeah slightly down playing joel's
role yeah i would say but you know
he's a modest guy what can i say
all right so this is our this is a game
dev uh show this week uh where we're
going to showcase some some process uh
eddie why don't you want you want to
tease up what are we doing today
um so we're gonna have a look at
something we've been sort of working on
in parallel with the colonial outposts
which is ruined versions of the colonial
outposts
the colonial outposts have been
around in law for a long time um in
terms of like the
the age of a lot of the systems that
we're looking at because these are sort
of ideally the sort of first
explorers into the sort of systems it's
like when we say colonialism you know um
it's the sort of first intrepid
explorers the frontiersmen who've come
in so obviously we wanted to have a look
at some
sort of smaller ruined versions of these
at the same time i was looking at the
more complete ones that we've also
thought everyone sort of saw in sitcom
citizencon last year
um so joel and cairo have been so
informing a little strike team to look
at these
and we're going to go through today and
build
uh what we'd call a module so a lot of
these most of these are sort of built as
sort of individual module that can
modules that men can come there that
then
uh sort of combined into sort of
locations by sort of using them in
different combinations of things
each module has a basically a foundation
which is what you're looking at now and
that foundation is quite bare bones
and then we add an overlay to that
module
which gives that module its theme and
today we're going to look at what we're
calling an occupied module
so the first version of these there'll
be two there'll be sort of just a ruined
which is kind of the default
overlay theme and then we've also got
some a bit more occupied as if um
the idea is as if there's some bad guys
or whatever who's sort of just using
this area
this ruin as sort of a temporary sort of
forward operating base or maybe there's
been a heist and they've come back here
to sort of just
re uh regroup before the next one a
little hideouty kind of vibe yeah right
well uh joel we've got your screen up on
the show now so uh you can go ahead if
you want to take it away uh we do have
the first question from the chat already
um just looking at your toolbar at the
top uh what the hell is wrong with you
uh so this is just to carry over from
too many viruses on internet explorer
you know the ask g's toolbar and stuff
uh no i'm a glutton for punishment uh
these are just
some handy little tools um that you can
use you know debug um
albedo mode and whatnot um
i can certainly talk through the
toolbars if you want to get started i'm
actually building some job
um but yeah so so basically
you know this is the that base module
that eddie was talking about um
you know it's bare bones
um and you know that's for a reason
because we build on top of that and then
the stuff that we build on top of that
can be swapped out for different things
built on top of it so
um
they vary in kind of levels of
complexity like how much is
is you know hard placed in these and
can't be changed
um
and mainly they're there for that reason
like we don't want that element to
change to be changed but um
because yeah these are simple kind of
locations or elements that make up a
larger location
um we're quite happy for a lot of it to
be changed up so
we generally just keep like the
footprint of what was once a building um
in the main main pass and then we do
everything on top of it so
it just like we we get some wild
variations between the modules um
yeah so that's what we're looking at now
um
i basically i've got like a little kit
library here um
pre ready to go and this is generally
the stuff that we've been using to
kind of start dressing and building up
these uh these modules uh
so my first step is gonna be
i need to sell
uh
some of the destruction of
this uh module i it has been a very long
time so there is gonna be elements that
have just
gone to time but you know
uh
when things are destroyed they often
leave stuff behind and so i'm gonna just
start placing some of these pieces from
over here um
to kind of hint at that that damage
that's fallen off
these walls
um
so yeah you know
just start getting some of these rubble
piles
um i'm just gonna grab all these
because i know i'm gonna use all of them
move it to the proper layer
yes i mean so what joel was saying about
the the how much is in the sort of base
module versus how much becomes in the
overlay the ratio obviously with these
is
very strongly towards what's in the
overlay versus what's in the base module
but if you take our other the more
intact outposts you'll find there's a
lot more basically the architecture of
the thing is in the base module those
are the sort of basic walls floors and
ceilings that don't change between each
overlay and the overlay brings in the
theme so the overlay brings in the
the dressing the lighting the vfx the
the sort of um all the props all the
furniture all that stuff all the stuff
that brings the sort of
the life to the bare walls essentially
and it just it's a quick way that we use
to sort of get another get multiple
themes within the same space so that we
don't have to like create a different
variation of the same thing every time
we keep the things that should stay the
same the same between each we don't have
to like touch them after we've made the
base version we just create more and
more overlays with different variations
to get a quick variety of things
so i'm gonna i'm gonna step in and i'm
gonna interrupt here real quick uh
whichever one of you has your discord
open we're hearing your your
notifications
no
i don't know
just checking i don't think i have
discord
i think it's just good
you're right it was discord it wasn't me
but it was definitely the discord nice
continue
uh yeah so
a little bit about um
[Music]
you know
you know why i'm deciding to place one
place and where um
generally just kind of want to hit uh
you know the hierarchy of like big
shapes medium shapes and small shapes
and kind of like feather them out so
you know you got these big rubble piles
um
and then i'm just supplementing them
with you know some of the these smaller
piles
um just so like that the transition um
with the terrain is a lot a lot nicer
um and we just don't just like
have just large details like right at
you
um and these these brushes are using the
organic shader which has some um
weld aligned uh texture and tiling
behavior so
uh we could scale these quite liberally
um as you see me i'm going to show you
that do you want to show that skill like
massive gel
because like so you maintain basically
the texture detail no matter how big you
scale these up and down obviously at
some point this thing's going to get too
big to be in any way believable but um
yeah it's pretty cool
so yeah i could i could take what would
be like a large shape and then bring it
down to like a medium shape as well um
it's just super handy um
and these uh
you know they're quite dark at the
moment that's just our um
terrain color pickup uh
text for on the shader um
obviously there's no planet in this
level so it's just defaulting to to a
black value but once we drop this down
onto a planet we'll start seeing it pick
up some of the
planets colors
uh
i think you know that that's pretty good
for now i'm definitely going to add more
like once i start adding like some of
the
uh some of the hard surface elements
definitely want to add some some rubble
there as well um you know like the
wind's kind of like blown it and it's
kind of pulled and collected near these
these elements um maybe something in
this corner as well
that should be good uh for now
um
and
uh
the next part i want to look at is
getting some interest and
um break up on the
structure itself uh like little bits and
pieces uh fallen off but some have maybe
stuck together and start hinting at you
know some of the construction properties
that were used um
to to build the structure uh
from like a law perspective um
[Music]
um that's definitely you know a part of
our art direction you know the
the elements that have made up the walls
um
you'll you'll see some of that hinted at
in
the main uh outposts
um
and uh you know we're trying to
we're trying to show you like what that
um what those elements like on down to
uh kind of thing
um
so i'm just gonna
do that real quick so
you know we got some rebar pieces
um
some concrete uh slabs
some more rebar so i'm gonna grab all
these
um
i like these floors as well i mean
but they're for the age of them like it
doesn't quite make sense that some of
these tiles are as intact and um you
know are still there
um
but i think it's the term used the other
day uh eddie like the rule of call like
of course it just looks cool um it adds
some visual interest to the ground um
not just walking on like the fresh
terrain with the wall jutting out of it
we always play this game with the
environment a lot of the time it's like
yes we want to make everything realistic
we want to make everything feel
believable and the player kind of needs
those familiar
like landmarks to be able to say oh i
recognize what this thing once was
but
um you can push that thing too far into
the realism side oh this you know
physically wouldn't be able to happen
this technically wouldn't be able to
happen because this thing but ultimately
like you've got to sort of find those
compromises a lot of the time with stuff
you see all the time like well that's
fine maybe it wouldn't happen in reality
but is it fun does it look cool then
yeah then maybe we'll sort of make that
you know you know i mean there is the
rule of call as we call it quite a lot
ian likes to use it a lot um
when we're talking about the art
direction sort of things like at some
point you just have to do well that's
paul so we're going to keep it in
because you know it makes sense there's
the rule of cool and then there's also
the
uh
how you balance between this is supposed
to be 930 years in the future
versus things that are going to be
recognizable
to players today it's like like like
somebody somebody can go to spectrum and
make an argument about how whatever
floor tiling like this you know
should be indestructible 900 you know
almost a millennium in the future
like this but you have to
you have to
make things that
connect to the people today
yeah and a whole sort of vibe with all
of the um sort of more rustic stuff that
we've been doing for a little while now
on our team is
is like there would be there is always
that kind of like
sci-fi element to everything there is
always that kind of like oh yeah i don't
recognize this it's a lot but then if
you don't like interspersa family with
all that it just ends up feeling like a
fantasy game and that's not what we're
making we want to make something that is
feel grounded it does feel real real to
the player you know um the player today
so yeah and it's a it's a con yeah
exactly it needs to be sort of at least
somewhat recognized there needs to be
these little landmarks everywhere like
oh well i mean and ultimately like
a bathtub still going to be a bathtub
but a lamppost is still going to be that
a door is still going to be a door
because humans are
built in certain ways and they like
certain things and even in like however
many thousands of years that that
stuff's not going to change too much you
know
one of my one of my favorites is always
trying to figure out how
language changes in a thousand years i
think that would be yeah that would be
insanely different wouldn't it i mean
heck just you know just like english a
thousand years ago with like the old you
know canterbury tales and the
middle english you know
with the show
you know like what is that like that's
english
i agree
yeah i had a major in college
oh i had a creative writing uh yeah
thing in
university it didn't really help me in
real life either
it was fun though
i expect pay attention
[Laughter]
he does at every opportunity
now i can't do piglet
actually i don't know why i've got a
i've tried i've you know you went for
the sophisticated middle english instead
i don't know why i just it's just though
it's
it just doesn't work in my brain
so it's this kind of stuff this kind of
bedding in and this kind of like
attention to detail that separates the
sort of
you know it's it's really important i
game it it pushes everything
that stage further it's just about
attention to detail after you've got the
big shape sorted out it makes a huge
difference to things
so glad we're still using rebar
a thousand years ago yeah it's a plastic
or composite something
well i think the idea is a lot of this
stuff i think when when the first
colonists would arrive they would they
would come down in their ships and
whatever but they'd also just like use
whatever's available on the land to
actually make their yeah i'm sorry
germinator is correct it's space rebar
space repair exactly
they're very different
yeah
they would stuff
yeah exactly they would use the cheapest
methods like maybe these things were
extruded originally maybe like there was
some kind of like weird 3d printing
machine but they'd still be built out of
like whatever the cheapest materials
were available on the planet that they
landed on i like the idea that there
could be something that was like
creating this to form or like you know
there'd be ships that could sort of
process local or into sort of usable
materials and things like that um you
know but i don't think like
these are not supposed to be rich or
affluent or particularly like these are
like hard scrabble
kind of colonists frontiers people so
they just use whatever's available
so i'm going to use these uh these big
pieces are well as well because some of
the these um
some of these like scatter assets they
can go out get quite like high frequency
um and it's good to have like some
visual rest now and then um so i like to
use these these pieces just to sit on
top of them to to knock down the
frequency
a bit and i'm also going to use
some of the small bits to supplement
some of these like rebar like
you know it's in the process of falling
down and
it just hasn't quite detached from the
the rebar yet
um
it will start breaking up some of these
these surfaces
and it's a super good example of
well the whole scene is coming together
but like
primary secondary tertiary reads is
something else we also talk about a lot
in environment are you've got to get
those big forms in first and make sure
that those look good and are right
before you really concentrate on the
sort of secondary and tertiary but of
like they're all equally important to
that final read it's just about how
they're distributed and the ratios of
each so ira you could you can't cover
surfaces in just
visual noise it looks terrible you need
those spaces of irs do you need those
moments of rest and usually what you'll
you'll split things up into sort of
sensible sort of almost like 70 30
ratios of things to to sort of
just ultimately like lead to a pleasing
a pleasing
final read on things
yeah it's not so much about like it's
not just the geometry as well like
because these are old locations like
there's a lot of um
there's a lot of wear and and
on the material side of things as well
so
you know it's a combination of you know
the geometry frequency but it's also the
frequency of the textures and the
environment it's going to be sitting on
so
uh we'll see in a bit like
popping this down on planet um
it's good to work in these construct
levels but like as soon as you can you
need to start seeing it in situation
yeah um
so you can really validate like the
experience with like all the other
disciplines kind of involved
um because that's just one piece of the
puzzle at the end of the day yeah
we can show you some of the sort of
little
physics stuff we've been looking at as
well and just it's not even really i
wouldn't even call it like puzzles in
the traditional sense it's just more
like things we can add to the
environment to make it feel and behave a
little more dynamically as well because
things like
movement and
thing and stuff like that are also
really important to to bringing an
environment to life and obviously like
joel said we're building out of context
with where the final actual placement on
the planet is going to be right now so
that's something you also have to have
in the back of your mind while you're
building something like this is like
you know
you know i'm also going to be
introducing like a whole bunch of trees
and rocks and landscape into the reed of
the scene as a whole at some point as
well
joel there's some
conversation in the chat about uh where
your accent originates do you want to
reveal that
i do uh i'm from australia
melbourne australia
australia australia okay
and honestly gradually joel's been
introducing all of the australian slang
to the team to the point where
we now we now use it regularly and
people look at it strangely when we use
it
uh yeah
who
we've got a good good quota of
australian guys on the team actually
do gradually taking over
yeah you know we've got studios in
in
five studios in four countries around
the world but
you know the uh the international nature
of our development team cannot be
understated that you you go to those
studios then you find people from all
over
oh yeah no absolutely a place we've been
brought in like we we will we'll take
the talent from wherever we can get it
angel
um
[Music]
yeah i think
obviously you know it's not done but i
think you know we're starting to get a
decent picture of
of like the footprint and um
what was once
a
a building uh kind of thing
so we could probably
just get rid of these so we don't
accidentally export them out with the
oc
but what i want to do now
is i just want to get this
little
cover mesh block i have
1.25 crouch cover um i just kind of want
to start thinking about uh because this
is going to be uh occupied overlay
um
where some some areas uh that i could
potentially
tweak to to get the cover height um so
you're not just a sitting duck explorer
in this area or
you know if someone's here
um
and you want what they got you can
approach
uh tactically and not just be deleted as
you uh approach
um so some of these areas are good um
and i just want to figure out you know
do i want to just
add some more of this uh
structural stuff to up to cover high or
maybe do i want to leave it for some of
the
the man-made stuff and
i think
uh i mean obviously i think here
is quite cover height
uh just need to think about
uh that peaking angle
can i
peak this angle and engage whoever's
behind it um
fairly maybe this area
this this this little uh
um
nook in the in the structure that that
could be like a little
nice
uh shooting gully kind of thing so i
might just move some of this rock out
the way
we like as artists we like pushing rocks
and things up against
the
bottoms of walls quite a lot
just because that beds everything into
the environment right and you don't see
those polygons clipping straight through
like floor like floor wall like straight
polygons but that also means that
designers showers there's quite a lot
because
obviously you want as a designer to
stack up clean against that wall and be
able to peek over it and know that
that's all along that wall is going to
be like a good crouch cover height so
it's one of those things we have
conversations with can you just move
this rock that you put in the way of my
nice cover please and that's exactly why
we do this kind of pass as well like
obviously environments are not built
just as art we work very closely with
the designers as we're putting one
together to make sure they work from
both so we both kind of are growing grow
to understand one another's requirements
for an environment as well
i'm going to take this moment here real
quick you guys keep working i'm going to
take this moment here oh that's too
close
uh i want to shout out uh not boof in
the chat right now uh not boof knows
better he knows that
environment artists don't work on login
servers but he knows that ai programmers
and physics programmers don't work on
login servers too but he's acting like
he doesn't in the chat you know and it's
making for a lively conversation uh you
can keep doing that or you can enjoy the
show i'd recommend enjoying the show
get back to the show
what is a login server
we only speak in terms of rocks and
poly counts
um
yeah while i'm doing this just uh to
make you know some conversation um
so you know obviously dressing
uh
building up the location and dressing
it's like
kind of one of the last hurdles of the
location but um
you know as as we're starting uh you
know a location like this
um
they obviously do the the usual you know
white box gray box pipeline and stuff
like that
um
but when it comes to like producing the
content um
you know a little bit about that
process uh
[Music]
we kind of stop and we we think uh you
know how do we want to break this up
like who do we want on
on what um
you know that could be down to
people's preference what they want to
work on their strengths etc
um
and then we break it down from there and
then
so like in this case uh
you know cairo uh handled all the
the structural elements which you know
he's going to show
hopefully later on a bit about that
process as well
[Music]
and
i focus mainly on materials and some of
the structure kit over here
but you know as we're working uh
you know it's it's constant
communication like oh hey
uh could i get this this kind of asset
because at the end of the day you know
we're trying to make a content kit
uh that a lot of different disciplines
and people can can get in and
and start building these locations maybe
maybe this part might be a bit too meta
um but definitely like placing down the
locations and stuff like that so
um
it's important that the content is
robust and you know it works well for
everyone so
you know that constant communication is
is great
um an entire skill in itself yeah
absolutely just uh did you like
it's like
it's like building with lego but you've
also got to decide what shape and form
all the bricks take as well uh you know
from the get-go as well so it's about
constant particularly at the start when
you're white boxing you're basically
just throwing in loads of shapes in
quite a broad kind of sense and then
it's about breaking those shapes down
into sensible things that can be
combined and recombined in different
ways and then it's about figuring out
like the final look of all those things
and making them all sit together as a
kit at the same time it's then been
building the actual locations themselves
so yeah it's a it's quite a long process
actually especially when you're starting
with nothing you might just be starting
with some concept art and sometimes
that's quite loose concept art to then
break that whole thing down into like
usable kits and stuff is is quite a long
job
yeah i think we had uh
you had fred on last time he was going
over some of the concept art for this
maybe last time all the time before that
oh gosh
and it's hard to remember
you do too many of these i won't
complain we do a lot of these i've also
done also too many a lot well don't have
too many of these the the fever that
started during last week's show
turned into like one of the worst colds
of my life last week i'm just coming out
of it now
uh two days ago we were thinking we were
gonna have to cancel the show because my
voice sounded like deckard kane
diablo
should take a lot of relationships but a
fever broke yesterday which was nice
folks who watched yesterday's isc
uh
i was that was that was a lot of cough
drops and a lot of uh
syrup
going to get that show recorded
it's not as bad as a
citizencon
uh 2019
we had to do that you know the whole 10
hours on the stage and
sent out
sent out a volunteer for for for cough
medication he came back with a bottle of
stuff and i took a couple of sips i'm
like oh yeah this will work go get me
more and it comes back with a bunch of
bottles and it's about halfway through
the show
we're about five hours into the show at
this point uh during during during the
cosplay contest and i'm starting to get
a little wobbly and i'm like
am i lit
and i look at the bottle and it's it's
yeah it's got alcohol in it and i'm like
oh
i've been i've been pre-gaming the
entire show haven't i
but then i got like the last hour of
citizencon in 2019 i was like super
paranoid that consummate professional
that that i was just like does everybody
know does everybody know i'm i'm just
borderline drunk at this point
uh because of the coffee maybe i'm not
supposed to would be admitting those
things but
so important bit here like validation
from a first person point of view like
super important we have like scale
references as well that we use quite a
lot for human scale
super important
otherwise you'd end up making things far
too big or far too small so getting in
and actually dropping down and and
playing the game um
it's really just that constant iteration
i swear to god if it has my face i'm
shutting this show down
no unfortunately they are generic grey
people
one team of professionals in this
company
glad we're here with him today
like that come on
yeah just uh finding any clipping issues
as well like
jumping into into game
making sure you know i got the scale
because it's one thing
you know
zooming up here
like a demigod um but it's a
completely different story at human
height so just want to make sure you
know the ratio
like the size of these these rubble
piles are not too big
uh
they're believable because i you know if
they're any bigger they'd be actual
pieces of the wall kind of thing
um
and i think uh you know this is a good
base uh so if you know this was an
unoccupied you know this would probably
be where it's at uh
you know we'd work with design to add
some loot crates um
uh
potentially uh you know other
interactable spots etc uh but it you
know it would be fairly unoccupied
it's been gone for a long time and
you're probably the first to stumble
across it in quite some time
uh
but as we said we're going to make an
occupied overlay um so you know the
premise of that is
uh
you know a certain
type of uh npcs has come along um
and they're kind of hunkering down here
maybe they're hiding from their law
and they kind of want to
you know set up shop somewhere uh that's
you know defensible uh with with kind of
minimum requirements of materials um
[Music]
uh or you know
explorers who have you know kind of
making camp here um you know so that
occupied is is kind of like a broad
spectrum uh it doesn't always have to be
you know a hostile encounter
it could yeah as i said like an explorer
it's just i know i've been trekking you
know i'm gonna pop a sleeping bag down
here and
have a little kip under the stars
um
but i think i think we'll go with
er maybe a combat
encounter for this one
um
[Music]
just cause
it'll be cool
um
and
i think you know that makes a lot more
use of uh this kit where
they've kind of salvaged uh some
scrap parts from
you know around the planet of
you know some some of the metal elements
that were once in the outpost they've
kind of retrofitted into like some
sheets and to use this cover or
makeshift structures kind of thing
um so i'm just going to grab a couple of
these
and i think i'm going to start blocking
out um some of those these cover areas
i was talking about before okay and even
with the like the just the pure ruined
ones you'd still see some of this stuff
we want to build up layers of history
it's not like a single thing happened to
this outpost that caused it to collapse
and that's how it's been left maybe like
50 years ago someone came in for a while
and then left again so it's about
building up some layers to the to the
sort of story of the location as well
and not just being a bit like one note
about it
yeah
uh you've also got uh about 20 minutes
left
20 minutes yeah i know mate
i was just looking at the clock
i'm going to start spray bottles
yeah and to answer uh there's some chat
there's some chat going on about the uh
the frame rate you're seeing uh this is
because we're all in four distinct
locations and we're screen sharing over
zoom
zoom has basically two screen sharing
modes one where it's high frame rate but
it's low picture quality and one where
it's a slightly lower frame rate but it
gives you a higher picture quality and
in the testing we were doing before the
show we opted to maintain the higher
picture quality at the lower frame rate
so yeah that's what you see you can see
that it only really suffers when it's
actually moving the camera around yeah
it's moving fine for joel on his end
yeah this is just
when you're scaling stuff and rotating
stuff you're like you're fine really i'm
soon
that was not benny hill music
who knows what that music was from
i'm in the chat somebody in the chat had
to recognize that
somebody very old
so i think what i might do is uh i'll do
like one area here
um
and then i think we'll give kyrie some
time to to show
yeah uh what he was on and then in the
background i'll continue and then maybe
if there's some time at the end we can
kind of jump back to it and
show you where where i got up to kind of
thing
we kind of want to
put this on a planet as a sort of
final thing anyway just so you can see
it all in context but yeah we won't have
time to probably build
what we normally might call a full a
full one today yeah maybe if it's not
too far along i i guess we will we could
use one of the existing ones uh we're
just very weary about you know spoiling
too much of it but i'll just give joel a
task to finish this off
next week we'll get in
hey i gotta do these shows every week
you wanna come
back parked it
you just needed jiren for it
otherwise my producer shouts at me
maybe we need the pressure of a twitch
audience for everything we do i think we
might maybe we'd get
stuff done a bit quicker
that has not been my experience
besides we need all those
uh we need all those devs dedicated to
uh bed sheet deformation
you know i think
you know for this little area this might
be enough
have we got terrain modifiers in this
already joel oh we do
oh we do oh that's nice i did a pass
before beforehand
good
because obviously we're building on a
we're building on a flat surface right
now but when we get onto the planet no
planets a flat surface so we have the
terrain modification volumes which will
give us a nice flat
uh it'll deform the verts of the terrain
event essentially to give us a nice flat
place to put this on
and also we've got exclusion volumes
because um
you could also put this in the middle of
a bunch of rocks and trees and the
exclusion volumes will cut out the
scattered assets of the of the planet
um we kind of need to make a lot of
these a little bit far
fire and forget because we
have a lot of them we want to use them
over and over and over in different
combinations
uh becomes very hard to manually manage
each individual location as you can
probably imagine so like the more
automated we can the more safe we can
make these to place anywhere on a planet
the better for us um
yeah fewer bugs and all that stuff
just thinking about adding some side
cover here
you guys aren't hearing me cough right
i'm rocking the mute button
okay maybe caught the tail end of that
last one
that that seems uh
about right
uh
you know so that would be
you know it doesn't need to be much more
than that um
at the moment
um
so yeah i guess if we want to uh
switch over and kyra can go over some of
the asset creation
side of stuff
um
i'll continue working this up in the
background
you won't you're maybe um maybe get it
on planet yes you want to tag out and uh
cairo you started your screen share
yeah can do that
yeah it was uh
i don't remember who it was but uh it
was it was the match game
cool
uh
yeah
all right cool and we'll switch to
cairo's uh the screen change
so
joel was talking a little bit about
earlier at the beginning of when he was
building a scene of those sort of
bare-bones strip-backed
structures that we're making that we
then
you know build our kits on top of and
sort of supplement and add secondary and
tertiary details to
so i'm just going to demonstrate with
our houdini tool how we would go about
making one of those structures and also
introducing some damage for that and how
about and how we do that in a procedural
way so that we can knock out quite a few
of these and get them done in a
relatively short time frame
so
what's cool about houdini is it's very
much a node based software and it's very
much non-destructive so basically
anything we do here can be replicated so
that i don't have to go into max and
make another broken wall
so
you can either
for this tool you can give it a
mesh input and then that's going to be
what's going to be damaged and deformed
or you can give it a profile input which
is what we're going to do in this case
so i think
this is the one so this is the
pretty recognizable profile of the
buildings that we have for the
colonialism outposts probably would have
been seen in
citizencon on pyro so now we're going to
take this wall and we're going to just
mess it up a little bit
so what i can do is
i can make
a curve
which we're then going to extrude that
profile along
and then what we can do pretty freely in
houdini without too much extra fuss is
we can also
define extra points for it
so i can just add
another point over there and it's going
to instantly give me
a wall that's been curved for us
um
we do have quite a bit of extra
functionality within this so if i wanted
to i could just snap stuff to the grid
and move it across over here
if we wanted another section of wall
probably wouldn't do in this destroyed
situation
but we can do that as well
then if i go into some of the sub
functions that we have over here we can
also play around with what areas are
going to be curved what are going to be
straight
so we do have a lot of freedom with this
technique to
really get quite a lot of content going
for it
but
i think at the moment we'll we'll deal
with quite a simple wall just so that we
can get this done fairly quickly so what
i'm going to do is i'm just going to go
back to my curve
delete these and we'll just have a
straight wall about
yeah i think about 20 meters long
and then we can also supplement this geo
that we've created with additional geo
whether that's procedural or not so i've
just added
some boxes to this over here which are
going to make up the interior walls of
the structure
now for the the interesting part of the
tool is
we can run the damage simulation and
then it gives us something like this
so it can really
very quickly give us an idea of what the
what the damage looks like and
we can very quickly iterate on that
so this has been done
just by
placing some booleans around the
structure and then we apply a noise
modifier and then that sub function
looks something like this
so you can see it's just a it's a lot of
noise and a lot of spheres but what's
what's really nice about it is that we
have quite a lot of control over the
look and feel of the damage
so this is quite a large structure so if
i wanted to i could increase the height
of this noise and then that would
sort of increase
the the sort of jagged edges and the
look of that
or we can go back to something that's
been a bit more worn down by time
and because this is a boolean operation
i have control over each of the
individual spheres that make up the
damage so
if i just want to move some of the
damage over a bit you can also do that
so it makes it very quick for us to art
direct the kind of damage and the style
that we would want
and but perhaps most amazingly is that
it's all non-destructive so you're
you're not ever
you can go back and change any aspect of
it at any point in the process so if i
don't decide i didn't like the damage i
can go right back up my node tree and
we've got a whole wall intact and we can
just go back down again
and it generates
variations it's super quick as well like
a b c d e that easy
yeah so once we end up with something
like this that we like the look of we
think it provides a nice silhouette for
the play on the horizon if this reaches
high enough to see that that is
obviously this is a little bit more
built up and less
run down than the one that joel was
demonstrating but we have quite a nice
variety of those
so once we've got to that point
we're going to run chamfer modifier on
our edges because we would ideally like
to get a very distinct difference
between the the stucco walls and then
the concrete and the sort of interiors
of the walls
so we just do that so we can
generate edge decals for sid walls so
all i'm doing over here is
i'm duplicating
the boolean operation
and
getting geometry that we can use for age
decals and we can apply
various materials to that just to break
up the material read of that wall
and then another great thing about
houdini is
the um the ability to
automatically generate uvs for this at
certain
texture ratio that we require
so it might not get you all the way but
it gets you definitely i'd say about 90
percent of the way and this is basically
ready for us to
throw into 3ds max and get into engine
and see how it feels in place
yeah houdini's got
quite a lot of functions that are really
useful for us so we can design different
material types we can split since
various different fbxs or 3d files
and yeah it's very useful and as we said
so now
we've now generated this wall with one
input but i've now decided i would like
to go back to this mesh generated in max
all i have to do is i have to plug this
into the boolean operation and then it's
going to inherit
that damage
now it's not as bespoke as the the other
wall because it's not been tailored to
the specific mesh but all we have to do
is then
go in and just have a bit of play around
move these spheres around
and you can really end up with anything
that you want
so this was a pretty much the process
that we used to generate all of the base
structures for the derelict outpost and
that's
part of the kit that we built up and
that troll started to use with
and it just meant we could essentially
take a load of the meshes we'd already
made for the outposts and just run them
through houdini to create destroyed
variants of them that quick
yeah yep
and then with new tech with new tools
like mighty bridge that you don't even
uh yeah
it comes online yeah we're not using it
here in this example but eventually you
won't even have to go between the two
programs at some point yeah hopefully
this could all be an editor yeah
how much time do we have left jared well
i got about nine minutes
do you wanna do you wanna schedule up
sort of yeah as much as they can be here
i'm just gonna remember how again
you may have to stop your share kyra
cool
sometimes zoom lets you take over sharon
sometimes it doesn't it's pretty
weirdly inconsistent
can i give a shout out because
um
jared is all right yeah
my boys my sons are watching downstairs
on the twitch stream so i said i'd give
them a shout out so dexter felix shout
out there you go
uh and to a freak sheep as we discussed
earlier today uh the frame rate is
because we're screen sharing over zoom
at high picture quality and low frame
rate uh in order to maintain high
pressure quality because we're not all
in the same place so what you're see
what you're seeing is frame rate is not
the program as it's being used uh by
joel or cairo what you're seeing is zoom
brushing it down
i'll leave the uh fps counter up here if
you like just so you know where it's
like 60.
um
yeah so here i am on
stanton2b damar
i've gone ahead and i've placed you know
that base module down i only got like a
little bit more
more work done on on the structure stuff
um so it won't look terribly too
different uh but a couple of things you
know i wanted to highlight um
you know one of the the first things is
the the
the terrain um
entity that's you know gonna get rid of
some of these unwanted large structures
um
as well as uh
there's the smoothing uh volume so
we don't always have to find you know
ideal flat spots anymore you know we
could have you know a structure up here
silhouetting
um on the sky etc um
and those two systems yeah just
basically mean that
you know we
when scouting for locations we just find
somewhere that looks cool now um
and obviously you know
we don't want to go too overboard with
the the smoothing volume because you
know
we're going to start ruining
the behavior of the planet and it's it's
going to look a bit unnatural but they
still don't work well on like cliff
hedges or like super steep slopes but
so hopefully if i
bring back the oc
that i placed
you can see i got rid of that big rock
we've got all those elements placed down
on planet
um
see all the rock assets are blending
much much more much better now yeah so
all those ones that are black in the
construction level are now picking up
the tint of the biome that they're on
essentially
to blend blend really nicely
oh sorry i'm moving too quick i i keep
forgetting about the
so i'll move
um
yeah so i guess at this point it would
be about finding
errors uh
you know brushes that aren't meant to be
there i think i forgot completely forgot
to
put one of the brushes on the correct
layer so
[Music]
i can quickly fix that
if i release that oc
well
to be overwritten
and then i'm just gonna
update it real quick
i did that in a in a separate editor um
so yeah now it's back
um
it's just a i had to
delete the oc because it
it
um locks it for for writing if it's been
referenced in a in a different level
just so you can't
mess anything up um we use we use
multiple editors all the time because we
have our construction levels we have the
levels with the context in we often we
maybe even have three or four editors
open at once because we deal with like
these hierarchies of locations
yeah
so i guess uh from from here what i
would do is
i kind of identify areas that i i kind
of want to work up up a bit more i think
you know areas here could use a bit more
feathering
um into into the terrain like this area
works well uh just trying to see if i
could get
more of this around here
um
i think the rubble piles are good
maybe
i'd introduce some more to kind of
insinuate a wall that was there but it's
no longer there so kind of tracing out
like um the outline of a building with
some of these rubble piles
um
and then implementing
uh start implementing some of the
um
you know traversal mechanics uh vaulting
um
ledge grabs and stuff so you could get
up here
um get some ai in as well yeah mike
might send us over to design say hey if
you got any ideas of maybe where we
could hide some loot um
that kind of thing uh
and then it would just be like working
it up um
a bit like slowly but surely over time
like you don't have to commit to
anything like i could put this in here
and like now i've got it in here it just
feels kind of awkward
on the silhouette but you know
i could either remedy that by um
filling it out like i think maybe what
would be good is if i added another
platform over here
um let me get some verticals there as
well
and then maybe you've got to jump over
here or something like that or use a
tractor beam to to kind of makeshift the
bridge using some of the
the metal sheets that are lying around
um
just that kind of thing and then
you know once once all that those
foundations are there like other
elements that are currently there are
they
do they feel good are they fun kind of
thing and then you'd kind of go in and
start polishing things like
cleaning up clipping and um
putting like the bells and whistles on
everything really
get some movement in as well i think
you start adding some soft decks we've
got some physicalized cloth and stuff
that uses the wind from the planet so
adding that is always a win because it
just adds that sort of life and movement
to the scene
uh there's a question in the chat uh is
this considered one entity or are
multiple entities within the objective
system i guess this is made up of two
object containers right now you've got
your base object container and then the
overlay object container that sits on
top of that so at the moment this is two
entities but those object containers
will also contain entities themselves so
the object containers you know lighter
entities cover markup as entities fog
volumes are entities
soft dx's and like everything's lots of
stuff are entities within the in the us
vfx yeah all of that yeah anything
anything that's basically dynamic and
isn't just a static brush there's an
entity of some kind
we've we've basically made all of this
out of just static geometry right now so
that's just static i mean even that's a
type of entity if you want to get
technical about it
but it's like there's a difference
basically anything that's generally
dynamic or interactable is is what we'd
call an entity the ocs are entities
themselves but the nfcs are really just
entities that contain
other entities like we deal a lot with
hierarchies
oh oh you died is that where we ended
and that's the end of the show good job
oh it's night time uh yeah the planet
spanners rounds
but like
just
like we've built something within the
space of an hour that's actually a
pretty cool little thing that you could
easily come across just on your travels
and maybe it's populated with
a bit of ai maybe you find a little bit
of loot this is the kind of thing maybe
there's a combination of five or six of
these types of modules in one area so
that you have a little sort of just
encounter that you can easily come
across
um yeah
yeah
you spun the planet so fast to knock
himself over
i mean once
once we have like
the kits and the sort of assets and
stuff because that is usually the thing
that takes the most amount of time is
the asset work actually sort of world
building and set dressing like joel's
been doing here is actually that it's
really fun and and doesn't take as much
time as actually putting the sort of
kits together in the first place what is
that oh is that is that it's not a guy
though
what is that
i don't know
and with that my my mic the vfx uh
principal's going to showers now for
zooming in nope nope there that'll be
that'll be that'll be a mystery that'll
be a mystery we won't reveal that today
uh that's it everybody you did it
congratulations
cairo you've done your first you've done
your first video for star citizen how
did it feel
yeah good i enjoyed it thanks for having
us again it's not so bad it
always feels more anxiety-inducing than
it ever actually is
um
joel cairo eddie thank you for taking
the time out of the end of your week to
hang out with us uh if you haven't
checked it out already check out uh
inside star citizen from yesterday it's
a full sprint report episode with
updates from
development teams all across the world
uh remember that invictus launch week
starts next week uh
you can go to the
robertsspaceindustries.com website and
find out more details about that it's
one of the biggest events of the year uh
yes it is it is coming to the planet
crusader this year uh for the first time
so who knows
what else
that
enables and leads to we'll have to find
out uh and then uh the next two weeks of
isc are all invictus launch week related
uh we'll be exploring we'll be exploring
uh um uh some of the new uh uh ships and
vehicles that are coming to the star
citizen universe uh throughout the event
some that you're familiar with
some that
you're probably not supposed to be
familiar with but you are because you
read certain subreddits and maybe one or
two that it's a complete surprise who
knows i don't know what you do with your
time
maybe the whole thing's gonna be a
surprise
so uh so yeah so tune in for that and
then we'll be right back here uh next
friday with the ai team uh we got
members of the ai content feature in
tech teams on we've been talking about
their work uh quite a bit lately in
inside star citizen and they'll be here
to answer your questions uh look out for
the question gathering thread that goes
up uh usually on mondays for that if you
want to uh uh
submit your questions jared can you
adopt me uh no uh i don't even have like
like super formal residency here in the
uk right now i'm just here on a visa so
that would that would be a lot of
paperwork
um
just
not gonna happen
all right everybody take care see you
next week
thanks jared bye everybody thanks
everyone bye bye all right
what was that thing
all right i'm gonna go no idea
i'm gonna suss it out now
i think it was just some weird vfx in
the
weird planetary like wind the effects
yeah it's like a little
serpent in the sky
i don't know i don't want it didn't
didn't look super glitchy at least it
sort of looked like it was supposed to
be but now now now we've like
i've left the stream
the stream's still on but they can't see
it so they're just being tortured right
now with our discussion of it
they can't see what is it oh but they
can hear us right now they can hear us
but they can't see it i mean oh god
wow
