hey all greetings from sunny united
kingdom it's a time of change at the
moment as i relocate from los angeles
and our wimslow and frankfurt offices
prepare their move into the new digs
over the next coming months
that means that this quarter of isc may
be a little different a little more run
and gun than usual recording from
wherever we can week to week whether
that's our old wimslow office you're
already familiar with sticking our heads
into the currently under construction
new offices here in manchester or even
my new flat that's currently filled with
half constructed ikea furniture
yes it's an exciting time for isc and
for cloud and parent games as a whole as
we continue to grow so please uh pardon
our desk this quarter as we continue our
look inside of star citizen's continuing
development and we're going to start
things off this new quarter and this new
year of the show with a brief look at a
presentation given recently by our own
forest stefan to directors detailing an
evolution of our wear and biome systems
we want to put forward into development
later this year
greetings all forrest here some of you
may know this
i love playing star citizen i play it on
fridays
and i was running around microtech when
i realized there was a bit of a problem
there were some major inconsistencies
between the characters the weapons and
the environment in regards to the biome
accumulation
so i try to come up with a solution and
then i put together a presentation
because before we decide to work on a
feature of any kind it is important to
make certain we're all on the same page
so today i'm going to share with you
some of those ideas from the
presentation i recently gave to cr and
other directors before any of the work
it started
now disclaimer jared said you'd find it
interesting so if it's not
blame him
so for those of you who don't know biome
is weather and accumulation is the
effect that that weather has on the
materials
so if a character walks into a biome
that character's shader will reflect the
weather
[Music]
simply put if you walk out in the rain
you're gonna get wet
[Music]
right now when you play the game there's
only a single texture handling all
accumulation effects per asset
so my pitch to chris was let's make it
procedural
how we did this was we used substance
designer to automate any textures needed
for any biome required
this alleviated all labor off the
artists
so look when you have a bunch of people
creating the same thing you're going to
have different results because we all
see things differently
doing this procedurally solves the
visual inconsistencies of biome
accumulation
and of course with graphic support it's
going to be even better
all in all the reason this is so
important to me is it gives us that
immersive planetside experience while
playing the game
on my friday nights
wear and biome accumulation are
essential elements in creating a
universe that feels simultaneously alive
and lived in with its expected and
anticipated effects on players buildings
and vehicles alike and up next the teams
have been busy while we were away so
let's check in with the ai and eu
sandbox teams in this week's sprint
report
to get things started this week let's
jump into the world of ai with some
sprint updates from a variety of tasks
the team is tackling for both star
citizen and squadron 42. up first is the
collision resolver now currently in the
claustrophobic corridors of a ship or
station npcs will often have no
collision so that they can get to where
they're going relatively unimpeded but
nobody wants characters just walking
through other characters so the
collision resolver is a new system
currently in development that will
temporarily shrink the physics bubble of
ai and change to the relevant animations
allowing them to pass through many
situations they currently cannot
in addition missions that require ai to
come down from orbit and either deliver
or pick up the player or goods often
follow the terrain just a little too
precisely bouncing needlessly up and
down over obstacles far far below it
making it look well just janky as heck
so the ai flight path system is getting
new features that allow for both local
and look ahead searches to determine not
just safe altitudes that they can reach
their destinations with but also fly a
more smooth and natural motion than ever
before
this system can also potentially be used
to allow npcs to determine their own
landing spots using many of the same
size and shape and availability
judgments the players themselves have to
use
and that's pretty cool
the team is also working to improve down
state reactions as you can see here
where a group of actors discovers a
fallen body
in this case they might just rush over
investigate and then fan out as seen
here
or perhaps they'll slowly approach with
one person investigating while another
stays behind to provide cover
and for anyone that's ever done the
underground facility mission
improved response times for when their
investigation of a fallen comrade is
interrupted by an uncautious player
the ai content folks have also recently
completed a sprint on a variety of
usables such as these vending machines
where ai will ponder their selections
use their moby glass to complete the
purchase
and even get frustrated when it doesn't
work out
and then you can see here the entire
carbonated refreshment flow behavior
where we get our drink
return to our table
consume our drink
and then dispose of it in the receptacle
where it can be properly despawned to
preserve server performance
[Music]
and before we move on let's go back to
that failed reaction from before and see
if we can really get inside the head of
our ai in this exact moment
all right let's see
think i'll go for a peach flavor today
make my payment
boy
what gives
hello mr machine man
oy bruv give me my peaches and prawn
delight
well that ain't right
hey
make you wakey
i ain't got time for this
well maybe just a few minutes more
hello
boy this thing is really uh
really fastened in there
doesn't move an inch
you know back in my day we used to move
these things all over the stand system
you're lucky you're not physicalized
bruv
all right moving along let's check in
with the eu sandbox team and their
continuing work fleshing out the
derelict outposts to be found on the
surface of pyro's planets and moons what
you're seeing here is a white box
traversal test the kind of work often
done by level designers to flesh out
aspects of the intended gameplay
experience before artists come in and
finish it out visually
and as you can see here these derelict
outposts are intended to be canvases to
a variety of mission types and emergent
opportunities storytelling possibilities
and given that it's pyro maybe even some
unavoidable pvp firefight eventualities
and in addition to working on the
colonialism outposts the eu sandbox 01
team are also exploring new gameplay
opportunities out in the farthest
reaches of the upcoming pyro system what
you're seeing here is some early
pre-production work on larger scale
points of interest to be explored
throughout the system utilizing debris
from capital ships or in this case
defunct damaged or destroyed space
stations from days gone past
the upcoming pyro system is intended to
be rich with a history more violent and
conflicted than the stanton system
you're already familiar with and without
the efforts of mega corporations like
arccorp hurston microtech and crusader
keeping things relatively nice and tidy
that means a variety of husks relics and
otherwise aging locations to discover
from the nearly 500 years of space
travel and exploration that have
occurred in this lawless frontier
this also includes variations with
pre-existing pathing solutions intended
to guide players safely to their
destination through a damaging or
otherwise dangerous array of obstacles
not unlike the famous coil from squadron
42.
yeah they may be lawless out here but
nobody wants to die unnecessarily
speeding through an array of
microasteroids or by losing hull
integrity to corrosive agents and the
like when making their way from one
outpost to another
they're outlaws but nobody likes a bad
road trip
and beyond just being a cool place to
explore visually it's important these
points of interest provide gameplay
opportunities to players within
as the mission system spawns its myriad
of mission types to explore collect
attack rescue salvage repair and more we
also want to create environments that
provide compelling reasons to leave your
larger ships at the outskirts safe from
the dangers within where a smaller craft
would be perhaps a more tactically sound
solution
and if you're asking yourself
what the heck is this place we're gonna
talk more about what you're seeing here
later in the year
so what we learned this week well we got
a glimpse at the earliest stages of
feature iteration with a look at the
exact same kinds of presentations given
internally to directors to scope out
work for the months ahead
that the ai team continues to push the
everyday behaviors of npcs and
naturalistic ways in their continuing
efforts to create an immersive
experience for all players and that
traveling through space looks to get
just a little more involved and
potentially a lot more dangerous as we
continue along with our path to pyro
that does it for us this week for inside
star citizen i'm jared huckaby we'll see
you all next week
you
