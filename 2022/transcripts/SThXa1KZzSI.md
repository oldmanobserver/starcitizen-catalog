## Transcript

hello everybody welcome to another
episode of star citizen live the eu pu
game play feature team i'm your host
jared huckabee and if you've never seen
a star citizen live before it's where we
take about an hour out of the end of our
week and we hang out with our developers
we sometimes we
follow their process see how they work
sometimes we
throw them to the wolves and answer your
questions live
on the show this week we have members
from our eu pu gameplay feature team hi
everybody
[Music]
uh we've got uh uh we we we've got eric
this way
uh jacob and torsten um
torsten and jacob you've been on the
show uh before but every show is
somebody's first show so let's take a
few minutes and introduce yourselves and
and and tell everybody who you are and
what you do for star citizen uh we'll
start with you thorson
i'm thorsten and i am the senior systems
designer for the eupu feature team
and what does the senior systems
designer do
it's
the the every system that runs through
us like uh
mining
and
now salvage life support engineering
everything that needs to have a proper
paper design and
some proper functionality associated
with it and basically my job is
to create or envision those
functionalities with
still fitting into the vision from from
the entire game
and when does the venue mergement come
out
that is not a question that i can answer
all right um jacob uh who are you and
what do you do for star citizen
hey i'm jacob i'm a gameplay programmer
and so
i mainly am responsible for the
programming of the loot generation
system uh and i also maintain the room
system as well
and how many planets or moons will the
next system have
that's not a question for me
i i'm okay i'm sorry i didn't realize i
woke up and i'm gonna i'm gonna
i'm i chose violence today uh joining us
to the show the first time this his
first show and he must think this is
crazy and like what did i get myself
into uh yarrick who are you and uh what
what do you do for star citizen
uh hello i'm jarek i'm a game programmer
like jacob so also programming
i do well now i'm doing live support
before i've done some that the laser
treatment for example and some of the
mining gadget work
and yeah that's it basically
and west hem united in last one the
english football cup in what year
um
i don't know let's say 2003
no yeah i i honestly have no idea i
don't even know if that's a real
football team or not i just
it's something i've heard
so uh
on the show this week we are talking
about eupu gameplay features um
these are things like uh refueling
loot uh mining uh life support uh uh
power management stuff like this um
there are there are multiple gameplay
feature teams in the company um there
there's
there's this team there's one in the us
there's a couple working with for
squadron 42 stuff
this is all my way of saying that there
will be topics that this team can
discuss and and and and answer questions
on and then there will be topics that
seem like it's theirs but it's actually
another team with a very similar title
in another country or whatever so uh
just keep that in mind uh as we answer
questions you may get you we made it get
a couple that's not my area or something
like that um it's part and parcel of the
game so we still got a lot to talk about
this uh uh this week uh this show was
originally scheduled to air exactly a
month ago on february 25th uh we delayed
it because of the world situation at the
time but we are back to that end we are
still using the questions from a month
ago so if any of these questions that we
come up with have been answered
subsequently uh we'll buy todd pappy on
last week's show or something we'll
mention that um additionally the time
has actually given us the the chance to
get some answers to questions we didn't
have answers to before so uh we'll see
we'll see how this one goes let's start
uh
let's start with refueling now a lot of
the questions that came in from the chat
all dealt with uh uh uh refueling in one
way or another probably our our biggest
uh source of questions
because it's been
two or three months now since we
discussed refueling on isc
let's go ahead and start with a a a
primer and talk again about how what
refueling
looks like in 317 how it works uh we
don't need every detail just just just
remind us of the flow here a little bit
so first off you need a staff error to
review and uh because this is right now
our only refueling ship we have
we at least have two variances we have
the normal starfarer and the starfire
gemini
and what you do there is
you start spawning your ship at any
harbor that you are at
then you need to open the vehicle
maintenance services that you already
know how to refuel
but now it looks a bit different so we
improved that
a bit to tailor to the demands of the
refueling mechanic and the staff era
so now you have two buttons which one is
the auto button and the other one is the
manual button and the auto button just
refills your internal fuel tanks while
if you click on the manual button it
will open a list of all the available
fuel tanks and fuel pots so fuel pods
are the ones at the outside of the staff
era there were the fuel
tanks basically you use for for the
refueling
so you fill them dedicated with whatever
you want to pick so you can fill all six
of them with hydrogen fuel if you like
but you can also fill
three with hydrogen fuel and three with
quantum fuel
and the next step that you need to do is
lift off and then basically you are up
for the market and
there sadly we don't have the beacon
system yet so you are reliant on chat
communication or
if you are in an organization you either
have discord or teamspeak to talk to
them to ask for for refueling
or offer their refu or for your
refueling services
and once you've found someone that is in
need
you basically extend your boom arm then
a docking procedure takes place uh you
need to set a price for the fuel you can
even give it out for free if you
if you feel like it
and uh then the dock chip
goes through the very same process
like you did on the station so the ship
in need opens again
the mobi glass goes into the vehicle
maintenance service purchases the amount
of fuel that the player needs and you as
the staff era owner then get the
request
and what you do next is open the
corresponding fuel tank to allow the
flow for let's say hydrogen to go
through the nozzle
and then you open the nozzle and you
can control the flow speed there so you
have an impact on the time it takes to
fill the other ship
and once the other ship is filled you
are done and both can park their way
how do you do euro and jacob did he get
it all
i saw you guys just like nodding as he
was going
like checking his work did you did you
do all that from from memory or do you
have cheat sheet on your on your uh
on your monitor
i i did it for memory i i played it a
lot and
so so yeah yahoo and jacob did also play
it a lot yeah we played played like the
recent internal play test sessions
all the time uh how has it how has it
changed in over over this quarter i mean
it was like i said we we showed it very
early we showed it in january uh which
is earlier than we usually have any of
this stuff because you know it was
originally targeting for 316 so so we
had a little bit earlier but uh
so with this extra time how how is
refueling
uh changed or evolved over this quarter
from the system itself not too much
so we did only some minor tricks so we
uh have now a variable flow speed and
that we didn't have back then so now
it's a bit you really have to pay
attention to the flow speed to not
damage your nozzle because there is
this mechanic of the safe flow speed to
the nozzle where if you are above it you
will start damaging it and we wanted to
emphasize this so we added a mechanic
that
basically the more pots you have open
the more fluctuation you have in your
system and that can
cause the flow speed to rise so that you
damage the ship
but the main difference is for
definitely the ui so we got a lot of ui
work done in the last couple of
months
and and it shows i'm really satisfied
with that and something that we did get
which we wouldn't have gotten if we
would have aimed for the earlier release
is the
direct interaction in the backside of
the of the staff era so right now you
have the
direct control screens directly at the
pots
and
yeah i'm really happy that we got that
so now
yeah
it opens possibilities let's phrase it
that way
possibilities for
like if someone accidentally jumps on
your catwalk and then closes the
the field steps
uh no i'm glad you mentioned the the the
ui uh um
in some respects i'm a corporate shill
so i don't know if i get to have
personal opinions about things but the
ui for refueling and the and the ui for
the new selling mechanic you know both
coming on 317 are some of the better uh
more informative and intuitive uis that
i think we've put out in time i don't
think it's any secret that
i mean ui is one of the toughest parts
of any game and and star citizen because
we're running a live environment in the
middle of our development with gameplay
systems that are not finished or
complete and
ui has always been a struggle and it
will continue to be a struggle while
we're still in development stuff like
this but uh the uis for
refueling and and selling both coming in
317 are two of my favorites that we've
put out there so
if i get to have an opinion i don't know
uh let's look for some more refueling
questions here how long
uh how long will it take in your mind
the fi or how long
how long will in your mind the final
refueling process take of course it
depends on the size of the tanks but are
we talking about minutes or hours
it's depending on the tank size so
for example we balanced it that
the gladius right now is with the
standard nozzle and the standard fuel
plots roughly 40 seconds so
that is
like
the the ship that we expect to use this
mechanic the most
and uh
yeah well if you want to refuel an 890
jump
it will take its time because it has
giant tanks and it
yeah it's it's not such something that
that we can magically increase the
number because we
we want to stick to like
a certain reality there in the sense of
a pipe has a certain diameter and it can
only withstand a certain pressure and
therefore we have this this
flow rate there as a mechanic and yeah
bigger ships will take longer to refuel
okay
um
still very much uh in the minutes not
hours
if everything works the way it's
supposed to lens
yeah
um
will uh uh
so jacob you've been working on uh
refueling uh
will the ship hanger or the sub attached
uh be able to refuel from their parent
vehicle i think it's probably like the
the merlin or the archimedes
uh when attached to the constellation
will it be able to refuel in that
situation
so to be clear i have not personally
been working on refueling but uh i
wouldn't answer this question before
passing it on anyway not good just just
not uh i tried yeah um i forgot yeah so
uh
not right now
uh and yeah may
probably something that we'll be aiming
for in future toast and you can
elaborate on that
that is correct
when i did when i did the promo for the
show this morning i i said it was an
hour earlier than it actually was i
clearly am having some like brain flow
problems today
um
all right
when a ship such as the starfarer is
full of fuel
and attacked and destroyed how will the
fuel be dropped will it be in little
tiny boxes or will it just vanish
so because the fuel is part of the fuel
pots
it right now will
in the current state it will explode
with the staff error and
if you
so we
i already mentioned the screen on the
back side of the of the staff era where
you control the
fuel pots and there's a little button
that says detach and the detach means
that you can drop those fuel pots
and this already gives you a hint of
what what our aim here is so if they
somehow survive the explosion
that means that
other ships are able to pick them up
again so if
you own a starfarer and you just
destroyed another sapphire and you wear
out of fuel pots that are filled you
might be lucky and can pick them up and
attach them to your stuff here but this
is
not for now this is for the future
now imagining starfire gemini is hunting
regular starfarers
um
let's move in uh let's look at some
mining questions here
uh
big rocks
or big clusters of rocks in our big are
big rocks or big clusters of rocks
incoming anytime soon for mining in a
group or are there any plans to force
multi-crew organized runs in the same
spot with multiple travels to clean the
location of valuable
minerals yeah so
about the bigger rocks so that could be
a short-term solution to the momentarily
like very
or
more or less
unattractive multi-crew mining
but we have bigger plans for that so we
have some ideas of how we can improve uh
multi-crew mining in the future
so some of the visions that we have is
that
we have some weak points that need to be
hit at the same time and even players
need to make them
explode at the same time so imagine a
situation where you are with your with
several prospectors targeting the same
storm everyone hits the same weak point
of the stone and then
yeah you have to time it so that you
don't damage other pieces of the rock
and then the the rock
splits and then you can proceed your
mining
same goes for for the argo mall then so
yeah it's it's also and what we also
envision there is that we even expand on
the functionality of the the mining
gadget so for example if you have a rock
where where the the weak points are
opposite you could use the mining gadget
to actually move the weak spot so that
you are able to use the argo mode but
this is
very
far off in the future right
right because uh
yeah we talked about it a little bit
with todd
last week because the the team's focus
is going to be mostly on resource
management and live support and stuff
for a little bit before you can circle
back
to some of these other
right now our focus is getting all the
features done once so you can we can
start iterating over them
um
when new menu gadgets come in like this
will be in the farther away in the
future i guess how do you expect the
community to use them if we can't scan
the majority of rocks now and i know
some of those
after some of the anastasia scanning is
being it was bug fixes that
utah talked about being fixed last week
yeah i think todd mentioned that already
last week when when he
we had some fixes in so there are some
fixes that that are
targeted for 317
and we hope that it fixed the majority
of the problems uh but it's it's a very
complicated manner so
we we hope that it fixed it but we have
to see and yeah
okay
um
this one may or may not be outside your
wheelhouse if i feel like it's probably
not but how do you intend to make and
balance mining to be a lucrative
profession that drives economy is that
an euphu gameplay feature team desktop
look this person is
between ships escorts modules
consumables timers etc that seems to be
an expensive and dangerous endeavor at
the moment
yeah that's definitely not on us to
decide it's it's on the economy side but
yeah i i fully agree so i i'm not a fan
huge fan of of quantanium being the only
profitable resource uh i have the
feeling that it it is something that
will change once we have crafting there
and player demands and maybe even ai
demands there so that that the the
values of each item shift
but yeah this is not enough to decide
yeah i saw you nodding there in
agreement you got something i'm thinking
like in general with those systemic
things it's just kind of it's
automatically almost gonna grow with
time and i feel like those vibes yeah
will change naturally over the
development you know
so uh yeah i can see it only yeah
getting better basically
but yeah again not up to us
i think the
the takeaway is that from a from a
design perspective uh correct me if i'm
wrong on this tourism we
we don't want there to be just the one
uh thing that's valuable to mine we want
it to be valuable for you
to mine different things at different
times in different places based on
market conditions nearby shops
etc and rarity so if a material is more
rare than another it should also be
worth more
uh i i think i think
viewers will find if they watch enough
of these
shows that uh
game designers often share many of the
same feelings and frustrations as the
players of of of the game when something
is limited or something is not as
fleshed out as as you may wish
it is not because people here didn't
think to do it it's just time management
and resource management and and like i
thought like like thorson said right now
the idea is to hit everything once and
kind of go around the wheel and and make
sure there's that there's there's an
introductory version of all these
features and then
go back and and fill these in so it's uh
uh i think todd actually said it
yesterday uh last week too
patience is one of the hard part for the
developers because we just want to
put it all out right now and do it all
out but we can't
we just can't work on everything at once
um
let's do one more mining question before
we move on
the this this one's a bit farther out uh
torsten uh in regards to mining is the
plan still to eventually have subsurface
deposits and veins that we can tap into
with our miners as stated in both the
prospector and land claim q a's
yes this is still the plan so once we
have the the land claims
yes you as the landowner should have
possibilities to
dig a hole and mine stuff or
and that opens the possibility for for
other
cases there as well
let's jump into life support uh we
haven't we haven't really talked about
life support since
i don't know when though i think it was
our our our la our last count disco
episode maybe in 2021
or 2020 i can't remember time is an
illusion um
start off simply how is life support a
few years ago it was mentioned that the
room system is finished and it could be
easily implemented what's the hold up at
the moment
how is that support yeah i think it's
it's good it's progressing definitely
i'm enjoying working on it
uh but yeah i feel like
the easily part is probably a bit
misleading it's it's more than just like
room system there needs to be you know
graphic user interface for all the
panels there needs to be controls for
the rooms there needs to be integration
to research systems so there's like a
lot of additional work that we're doing
right now
and then then also we have the setup for
the ships and yeah that's
but it is definitely progressing and i'm
happy with that
with it so far
um we do have uh a lot of ships to uh
yeah process to to get that
in a releasable state so
that definitely is a contributing factor
uh and
the
the question saying the room system is
finished
is not quite accurate either it's
constantly
um you know it in in development being
upgraded um
to support more new features and things
like that
uh
yeah
it
it's try to think of something i could
add to that but no that's pretty much it
it's it's a big feature
and every time we every time we add more
ships it just makes your work just a
little bit
like like like like like one part the
project keeps moving the goal post out
for you like it's only there's many
ships then we keep adding more ships
um
but yeah i i i i think it's a it's a
major component uh not just to uh
not just for the present day gameplay
but it's obviously an essential
component
to real like multi-crew um you know one
of the things
i mean there's not a whole lot of
multi-crew in star citizen right now
there's basically you're a pilot and
you're a tur you're a turd you're a
turret gunner it's like that but uh
things like power man resource
management and life support and it's
like those those are all how we be how
we build out uh the idea of true
multi-crew here and for me that was
always my draw to the to the game like
that's what the classic engineer role
yeah
would be a lot to make that
exciting uh in the not too distant
future when we have
life support i'm also thinking about the
fire system uh
in development that gives you another
thing for other people on on the ship to
do other than the pilots is oh we've got
a fire on deck three send someone to go
deal with that right that interacts with
life support uh
resource management all of that
yeah
so all comes together
the ship yeah
and and each time one of these systems
comes online that's another place to
send damage so you know
when ships are being attacked we can
send damage to life support and send
damage to power resource managements
like that so so the the time to live on
these ships will you know last longer
and stuff and it just it's
it's exciting it's one of those
the stuff the star citizen multi-crew
game play of today will not be what the
game plays of tomorrow and it's it's i'm
excited to see some
true progress towards that
um
is life support still planned to be
limited to people to prove is life
support still planned to be limited to
prevent people using ships as a clown
car
uh yeah yeah of course because like the
way the way it's supposed to work you
like like on iss you have the scrubber
it removes the co2 and it has only a
certain rate that it can process yeah so
if you suddenly
get like 20 people inside of a small
small ship that's designed for like two
people then your life support is gonna
start not managing it and you know that
the rate of flow of the air for the
system will be too slow the co2 will
build up and you'll probably die
but obviously it's all gonna yeah it
needs to be balanced well for the bigger
shapes and then
the different rooms in the shapes so
there's yeah
we don't want to put a hard limit on it
that is something so we want to have it
systemic driven so that means that
so if you have an aurora and you want to
claim it with five people
then sure it will
work but what you have to do as the
person running the aurora you have to
replace the skimmer constantly because
the skimmer just depletes very very fast
because the the because of the co2
production in the room
and then
yeah sure if you want to decide to yeah
every 10 minutes i have to replace the
skimmer yeah
sure yeah and also
also like you have you know life support
it's not only doing the co2 it's also
like temperature and the pressure and
those things will be also
hit by too many people breeding in the
room because then it's you know the less
time for hitting or cooling the room
so
it's gonna be interesting gameplay there
to balance what you want
in your rooms to the atmosphere to be
like
several people in the chat are listening
to your answers and all saying how does
any of that work with something like the
valkyrie
where you're supposed to having a big
open
side doors and and so how did it how
does that work with with some of these
drop ships that are designed to have big
open spaces to the
so one of the things
that will have to come along with life
support
is
dynamic atmosphere propagations
uh fancy name for just
air actually moving between things so if
you have the doors open you're gonna be
getting
whatever atmosphere is on the other side
of those doors
if you open the doors in space you're
gonna have a bad time for the
anyone on there who wants to breathe but
yeah you'll be able to fly around and
in in a way catch some atmosphere from
from the planet that you're in
and uh yeah
i think that'll have some interesting
implications
uh in in future for planets with
not human breathable atmospheres it'll
make your life support system have to
work a bit harder once you close those
doors to try and clean that up for you
and we've seen some ships like
the idris or the javelin they have like
the the star wars or star trek you know
um
force field
walls and doors that helps keep
atmosphere and not so it remains to be
seen you know what ships will have you
know stuff like that and what what may
not uh b quartermast says is this live
no
now last week we did all the thing where
i put it on the screen and said it
wasn't live but this week
i just i thought i'd let people wonder
uh
do we have any more life support
questions let's see
what do you guys have against clown cars
um will t0 of life support allow
atmosphere management on a per room
basis or will it be one atmosphere
setting throughout the entire ship
uh it's going to be peru we want to go
like as recently
granularis
yeah it makes sense for this year
obviously
so yeah you'll be able to set like the
pressure in the rooms you'll be able to
set the temperature in the rooms it can
be different insurance and like
also like that the rate for the scrub
being so like it's gonna be like a
balance for each room what what do you
want this room to behave like and
yeah there's gonna be
a decent amount of
uh like a choice there for a player to
do
one of our big considerations for this
is that
while you are going to be able to do
everything on a program basis we're
going to be making sure to have a good
focus on usability uh and again
the quality of ui will will help with
that so that it doesn't feel
tedious yeah yeah that's a good point
that like
there's gonna be like obviously process
for like oh just maintain this room in
like a normal state for life let's say
but then maybe
you want it to be like warmer than ever
so you're gonna focus the life support
on the temperature to keep the
temperature higher and like maybe that
you don't care about the co2 levels in
this room so it's
like i think the idea is for the
baseline to be very simple you don't
really need to do much but if you want
to go into these details for some
specific
purpose you can that's yeah
uh
zulu foxtrack
foxtrot keeps trying to uh backwards
engineer questions about night vision by
attaching it to questions about stuff
that you guys actually work on uh zulu
night uh uh was a zulu uh uh foxtrot uh
night vision is actually a graphics
engineering thing we discussed it uh
most recently with uh director of
graphics engineering ali brown so i
encourage you to check that out uh
there's no easy answer but the truthful
answer is in that show so check that out
it's like i have watched enough 80s
sitcoms to know when you're trying to
backdoor
a different topic into some which we're
actually supposed to be talking about
i wasn't born yesterday i was born a
long long time ago
a long time ago well life support
systems require consumables that must be
restocked
i think we already mentioned that so
yeah obviously you have the filters for
the
air
so
for the scrubbing of the
from the co2 so you need a special
material for that that will take care of
it
and
so that that's one we'll also have some
for like heating up the rooms we also
yeah
yeah probably a bunch it's gonna be
it's gonna be like a a real system
inside of the ship that you can you know
put things in and yeah make it work
there's a follow-up from chat that says
will depressure scrolling by will
depressurizing uh rooms during combat
provide any advantages
to stuff can you
drawing the air out of a room with if
you're if your attackers aren't helmeted
i mean possibly you'd get more power
life support obviously uses power so i
guess if you kind of turn it off
completely then you'd get more power
uh
i'm yeah
i like the engineering gameplay of
cut power to life support all power to
engines yeah exactly if you've got a
really huge ship where the life supports
taking up a lot of power then that that
could be a thing
but i think that question was more aimed
on
offensive uses of life support and yeah
you'll definitely be able to turn off
the air if you've got borders
yeah
of course of course you can like heat it
up cool it down but
we'll be right limited on how much the
life support system can actually
suck out of that room in a given time
well i mean yeah obviously rate limited
and also
well once you suck out the atmosphere
and you don't put it in the tanks it's
gonna be gone you you can bend it
outside yeah and then it's lost so you
can also have to think about that
so that's you know if you have a room in
your tanks then it's fine but
what about replacing
the oxygen with something toxic
uh so in tzia we won't have support for
like composition of the atmosphere
that's not
yet a thing but you're open to it later
on
um
yeah
so
something similar with fire i guess that
fire creating excess carbon dioxide and
carbon monoxide
does make the room it's intoxic but you
won't be able to do that on demand in
into zero
that seems to be a good bridge into uh a
resource management i i don't think you
can talk i mean any discussion of life
support has to go right into resource
management they're they're they're
inextricably tied um
we haven't we haven't talked about uh
resource management since we had that
wonderful uh demo with uh dan truffin uh
way back when um
what can you give us about it before we
get into the specific questions here
what can you give us a a as a general
kind of update where how is it going is
it going is it moved since we've we
showed it so long ago um
yeah there are improvements i mean some
things are necessary for life supports
to use it yeah
so
that that's what i'm working on actually
so we have like
i guess support for it to interact with
the room system you have to exchange the
gases from the tank with the with the
rooms yeah and that's that's all coming
together
you got anything to add torsion
and in addition to the work that the
arrow does for the live support we also
started working on the proper
engineering screens because they they
are the same so basically
the the live supports ui interface will
be just an
overlay or
a layer inside the engineering screen so
every engineering screen is also
directly a live support
user interface right
okay
just because uh it was that halloween
episode way back when nobody's seen or
heard from count discus sense
uh we've gained a lot of star citizen
backers since then can you just uh can
you give us a kind of a general overview
i'm obviously don't i'm not gonna ask
you you can clearly do it as we
demonstrated with the refueling so
not the entire loop but uh
what what are our goals what are the
goals what are the what's the intention
that's just the top level of resource
management power management however you
want to refer to it what are we trying
to do here
so our goal there is to give the end
the all resources distribution of any
ship in player samps so
we have fuel we have
fuel that is consumed by
the power plant and by the engines
and you are in control of how much fuel
those engines and the power plant gets
and depending on how much fuel the power
plant gets
it will create energy and you can
distribute that energy so for example
you could even say okay i don't need any
light in my ship so
none of the energy energy goes to the
the light
or the doors so all the doors stay open
for the for the full time but all the
energy goes to the weapons for example
or the shears
so this is something that that you will
be able to to manage on the fly
so
dynamically any time any day
on any ship
you will be able to
to have full control over the
resource distribution of your ship
yeah and this follow-up question is
probably very similar to the life
support one uh regarding resource
management will content teams need to
rework existing ships before this can be
implemented in the pu
yes
quite significantly actually yes
because we have some legacy systems that
work
but are not the ideal way that we
intended to have it work
so there are some optimizations that we
have to do so that it runs performant
and that we don't put too much stress on
on everything which is already
quite stressed so
yeah there's a lot to do for on our side
so every ship needs to be touched and
every item that is existing also needs
to be touched the good thing is that
it's kind of going to be a bit combined
i think with the live support so they're
because they both use obviously resource
system so
just like
at least it won't have to be done twice
hopefully maybe that's that's the big
benefit of this system so
because we now have the opportunity to
start or to to work on life support in
parallel with the engineering they all
tie together and
our aim is also to have them release at
the the same time
because it's sharing the same ui it's
sharing the same systems so it is the
same system it just yeah but there's a
bit more complicated stuff with with
connecting it to the room systems and
and so forth
so yeah
and it's not just uh
your team it's it's the ui team it's the
vfx team it's the sound effects team
it's it's it's it's it's this is a this
is a major major component of of
fulfilling that vision of ship life in
the star citizen universe and so uh so
yeah you guys are here at the vanguard
but eventually you know it's going to
open up and it'll be an all hands on
deck kind of thing
it's every team is involved there every
team has to do some
update stuff on on their systems to
utilize the new resource networks
so it's
yeah like you said every team
has to be involved here
uh we haven't talked to looting let's
let's switch to some looting stuff
we know that there are changes to a lewd
generation coming in 317.
it would be extremely useful if portable
loot boxes would snap to the cargo grid
of a ship or onto each other is yeah
yeah it would is this planned for the
future
so
short answer is yes but
slightly longer answer is that the
portable loot boxes in general are under
a bit of a review
um
there's um
there's there's a variety of
implications of them from both the
balance and the performance perspective
so
they are they are under review but we do
hope that in in the future you will be
able to stack them on your cargo grid
and do anything else you want with them
um that is obviously also
awaiting the cargo refactor
uh why is there still no scu cargo to
loot around derelicts what is needed to
put them in
so
the why they're not there uh is a
question for the level designers um but
as to what's needed to put them in
we
i'm fairly confident that we have uh
everything needed for that on the tech
side so
yeah
it's it's down to level design
uh to
put them there if they want them decide
you know what goes where
i'll add a little context to that just
so
jacob doesn't have a sniper dot from the
level design team on his uh on his chest
uh tomorrow afternoon uh that is part of
the the work that uh montreal is doing
with their new with the new you know
complete revamp of derelicts from the
ground up uh part of what you saw in isc
yesterday and stuff is them building out
the interiors and all that stuff and and
as part of that there will be loot
generation spots and stuff like that so
that's all part of the new uh the new
derelict 2.0 if you will uh for lack of
a better term
yes i i should add that we have been in
constant contact uh with with the level
designers including the montreal team uh
so yes they they are aware that
this is a thing uh that we could do they
they are
considering it
etc we're all working together on this
yeah
uh
will there ever be
uh
items or weapons found exclusively
through looting i.e you can't buy them
in stores
so that is uh absolutely a yes um i
think it was on uh one of the recent uh
iscs with samuel molina um who mentioned
that yes for 317 we're
introducing for the first time different
rarity levels
of
items and
loot boxes so yes
some of those rare items will not be
found in stores
and they will be
uh
yeah hard to get proportional to their
value
and
i don't wanna this is where i'm gonna go
ahead and say that there are nine of
those pico balls that spawn in the
persistent universe and only nine that
spawn on each server as they start and
i'm i've been hounding ben dorsey to
make them the most valuable item
in the p we'll see if we'll we'll see if
my peer pressure uh uh wins that or not
i actually i don't know if it will
probably not
people usually just shine me on
anybody's ever met me anyway um will
hydrogen fuel ever be a lootable item
that you can then go back to your ship
and use it to refuel yourself
that's a bit of a hybrid question
between revealing and uh and can you use
night vision when you do it
come on
[Laughter]
i'm not answering that um
but uh as for
the the the loot side of it
we've
we've been considering um all sorts of
features and how they can tie into loot
generation
um upcoming features existing features
we're
thinking about
what
related to this feature could you find
in a loot box and where would it make
sense to find it and stuff so it's not
out of the question that fuel could be
one of those things
but it does also depend on
how refueling continues to develop um
particularly with in hangar refueling
refueling of ground vehicles
those are things that are not fully
fleshed out
yet so
there are not plans right now to have
lootable fuel but we are considering
lootable
anything
uh
let's jump just some general stuff here
um historically decompression was a
thing with character force reactions and
life support atmospheric room containers
what's stopping the delivery of
decompression and people getting sucked
out of airlock mechanics
we actually we actually showed an early
prototype of that back in
2015 at gamescom yeah
yeah um
right so we've definitely
been uh thinking about that but it's
mainly a prioritization and an order of
order of business thing um that the
people that would be implementing that
um
mainly myself and yarrow are currently
doing
live support and
yeah other other things so
that's definitely on the cards but later
down the line um reliant on
life support being finished before we
start doing that
yeah
thank you
um and
yeah again definitely um
uh
the the what stopping part
there's
still a lot of um other
teams uh downstream requirements as well
but to get
that sort of explosive oh yeah the
effects the sounds that everything of
course
yeah that's again it seems like such a
simple thing but then you kind of have
to add everything there and you can
so yeah
i think it's it's
yeah
back on the
the discussion of loot and rarity from
the live chat here um do you
try anything how to reword this how do
many games have like predefined levels
of rarity there's like common uncommon
rare epic legendary to use the wow model
do we have those levels set are are you
are you at a place where you can share
with us what are the rarity levels
referred to as
and do they have colors
they definitely don't have colors we're
we're we're not we're not doing that
it would not fit with the
sort of level of realism that we're
going for
um
we do have
some fixed rarity tears of loot boxes um
and
at the moment uh off the top of my head
i think we've got common uncommon rare
but
um
what that means
is
not a a global setting uh so
what uh how how likely you are to find a
rare loot box is not going to be the
same in every location and its contents
are not going to be the same in every
location um
it's
something that the designers are
thinking a lot about of how to balance
uh what crates and what contents you get
where
yeah and it's also something that we are
having ongoing discussions with the
economy team about
how we balance the amount of value you
can get out of containers
also rare for stanton doesn't mean that
it's rare in pyro for example so items
that you are
more likely to find in stanton are
probably less likely to find in pyro
gadgets yeah that's a very good point
so when we talk about rarity
we are not talking about stats we are
not talking about uh uh
this thing is
not using it in the traditional wow the
model where you know every time you
fight this thing it drops a a an epic
thing it's we are talking about
rarity in the truest sense of its word
and how difficult it is to find how
difficult it is to acquire and what
you're saying is that
items will be rare in pyro but not
necessarily rare in stanton and then
vice versa yeah you know it's it's we're
taking it from a holistic
uh story-based kind of you know what
would likely be found in these areas
what would less likely be found in these
areas for a
quite literal interpretation of the word
rarity
yes we have
uh
different
sort of levels of of system working
together for that when a designer sets
up a location
they decide specifically to that
location
how likely different containers should
be
and they can decide how likely
certain types of loot should be
but then we do have a broad
sort of grouping of which items on the
whole are more
valuable uncommon rare whatever
or more
so
it helps the designers to
approach things bit by bit they can do
broad strokes and they can get
right down to specifics for individual
locations
yeah so i i just i i want to shout this
i want to make sure that this gets
really clear out there because i'm
looking at what's happening in chat
right now
it is not a
rarity is not a
measure of of the quality of the item
and it's like that it is not gear score
it is not it is not a purple item it's
better than a blue item kind of thing it
is
on microtech you're more likely to find
a pico
on
on crusader you're more likely to find
in finley
on hurston you're less likely to find
either one of them because hurston hates
those guys you know stuff like that
not using that specific example but as a
as as literally just an analogy it is
about just trying to make loot seem
diegetic and
real and
for lack of a better term just makes
sense what would you expect to find in
this kind of thing not to say that there
can't be surprises that's what the
rarity is now that there can't be
surprises there will always be surprises
in the world everybody loves a surprise
but
it's about
storytelling as most things are at the
heart
of star citizen
uh
[Music]
is engineering a profession
like mining and refueling
uh yes but also no
so yes on the side
yeah
the the main difference here is that um
for for mining and for refueling you
have a resource or you gather a resource
and then you sell it either to a player
or you sell it to a trader for
engineering it's yeah you you
stand around in a ship and you press
buttons
right so it's it's it's a profession in
the in the sense of yeah someone better
pay you to do your job else you will
mess up their ship and
it might
not work
but uh
that's that's it so it is a profession
yes yes but there is
there's nothing to trade with
yeah it it it's another distinction from
like the typical classes in an mmo
it's it's it's your character can act
like a rogue can act like a fighter can
act like a cleric can act like a
palanova there is no
hey suddenly i've chosen a thing i have
a label i am this
kind of stuff like that so i i think i
think that's probably the better way to
look at
uh professions as a human being who had
36
jobs before i came here um
you know it's tr and it's had six titles
here even though my job hasn't changed
uh trying to trying to label what you
are and how you do in life is not always
the easiest thing and i think we
we take that same approach in star
citizen we give you the tools to
be a minor on tuesday and be a salvager
on wednesday and be a refueler on
thursday and stuff like this and it's
not one of those is meant to like define
you
top to bottom kind of thing is that this
is my profession
it is they're all opportunities for you
to live your life in the verse and for
you to
swim through as
you see fit
hmm that's some jean-paul sartier
answers today does that he say his name
i don't know i shouldn't have even tried
to pronounce it i'm not the pronouncer
person that's right
did i do it
well if i did it was it was on accident
um
let's touch some refueling ones before
we got to go again uh since it's one of
the big ticket items for 317. um
will every ship in 317 have a physical
fuel port on the top and how will it and
how will the second fuel part port be
used
so no not all ships will have the
physical port
to the top so that is part of the gold
standard so
some ships
or ships that are coming
are supposed to have it already
so it should be already planned for them
but the older ships they they need to
some of them needed to be added so right
now the gladius already has it
and on the second part of the question
yeah the second port is mainly there for
hangar refueling so the top one is just
there for for in-flight
refueling with the with the staff error
and the the bottom one is yeah if you're
stationary someone with a hose comes in
and
refuels your ship this way
okay
uh how will the development of
ship-to-ship refueling change the
station and pad refueling we've had
going until now
well we did
not change the refueling
itself but we at least updated the ui
that you are
which i already mentioned
so that is the only impact we have there
um will there be an easy way to share
your location for for refueling
yes
once we get the beacon system sorted
then yes yes there will be
but that's not 317
certainly not certainly not
okay
um
and uh
well i think we just added an answer to
this one already where does refueling go
after 317 service beacons but also
server speakers
there are some gameplays that didn't
make it that we envisioned for the
reviewing so
one thing
so
i think most of you are aware that there
is this mechanic of this hidden stash
fuel if you are stranded in
in space
and you completely ran out of fuel so
you cannot
theoretically dock to the boom arm
anymore so you have this reserve fuel
that allows you to use this dedicated
only with docking to be able to talk to
the staff here again this is just in
something
there because we didn't
get the the
um
tractor beam right so there there's
supposed to be a tractor beam
functionality that can pull you in as
well as we envisioned a more direct
nozzle control because right now the
nozzle is very static so it's a stiff
nozzle but we we also wanted to have
some direct control over that
and tying to that we also wanted to make
it more interesting in flight for the
player attached to the staff era so that
there's a tension gameplay so if the
forces to one side or the other are too
high you as the attached have to
maneuver against them so
this is something that we we also wanted
to have there but it didn't make it 400.
um
all right and last question
did you enjoy putting together your lego
discovery and uh can you implement night
vision in order to make it easier
uh
i don't get how night mission would make
it easier but it's it's it's a fun lego
piece it's a fun little piece
it's just what it said
all right uh that's it everybody uh
thank you for uh being here uh for for
for coming back uh after we had to
reschedule your show last time um
that's been star citizen live the eu pu
game play feature team um
keep an eye out on the
robertsspaceindustries.com
uh website uh for information on when
317 uh is heading your way i know it's
in uh evocati right now um my
understanding at least
at this time this is just me being here
for as long as i have is that uh wave
one ptu is kind of a day by day kind of
thing um we absolutely want to get it
out in your hands anything but again it
has to reach certain thresholds it has
to be worth it has to be useful uh to
get it out into those tests and stuff so
if it's if it's already
at a certain point where we don't need
people to tell us it's broken because we
already know it's broken there's no
reason to push it out so
check check back on that for updates on
when that happens um
uh next week is our uh
last episode of isc for the quarter
before we go on our hiatus
we'll be doing our patch report we'll go
through all the stuff that's coming in
alpha 317 and uh something that i just
realized that i actually can't tell you
about because it's a surprise so you'll
have to tune in on thursday
to find out what that is
and then friday
back here
uh april 1st
it's jeremiah and i
it's gonna be dumb
you know it's gonna be dumb i don't know
what it is yet but jeremiah and i on
april 1st it's going to be dumb and uh
it may or may not be the last show we do
here uh in la depending on uh visa
processing time so who knows um we might
be here for a couple more weeks that
might be the last one i don't know we're
all just kind of waiting
so four uh jacob um and and uh eric and
uh torsten uh i'm jared thank you for
uh being here with us this week and uh
we'll see you soon bye
bye
thanks
i honestly have no idea what we're doing
on april 1st i just realized it was
april 1st when i said that
it was just going to be us goofing
around but now i got to come up with
something don't i
yes i know you can still hear me we do
this every week people like we can still
hear you i know
i do this on purpose
because i like chaos
