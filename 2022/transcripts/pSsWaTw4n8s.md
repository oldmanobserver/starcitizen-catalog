[Music]
in 318 the future is bright for cargo
for moving away from the simplistic
implementation that we had before into
something that's more of a real
simulation
with the new physicalized cargo it opens
doors for us to give some new gameplay
[Music]
cargo today is pretty basic you go to a
kiosk you use an interface you load your
ship it automatically loads getting that
ship you drive that ship to a port and
then you sell what you bought but
there's not a lot of interesting choices
there
with the current implementation whenever
we designed it we did not have the
tractor beans that we have now what that
meant is that you're not able to pick up
and manipulate the larger 1su boxes at
the time all that you could do was pick
up the smaller 1 8 Su boxes but this
gave us a problem for piracy and looting
in general in that the really valuable
things are sold and bought in these 1su
boxes and higher volumes but the only
thing the player can actually pick up
are the smaller ones so what we had to
do is a kind of hack and the cargo
system such that when a vehicle explodes
instead of generating the larger 1su
boxes on destruction it actually
generates the smaller ones in this kind
of gamey magical way so that the player
can actually go pick up some of the
boxes from the destruction
all right let me give you an example
the C2 has 696 SCU which equates to
5568 1 8 SCU boxes that you have to loot
but the ship exploding should damage
some of those boxes and we want to have
about 40 to 50 percent survive that
explosion so that's still about 2 000 1
8 Su boxes but then there's server
performance issues to consider so what
we've actually been doing is tapping
that at 10 boxes being generated however
on top of that it's an incredibly
tedious experience because now that's if
you were to do the math about 400 boxes
that you have to go pick up and
collecting all of those by hand without
a tractor beam
with the new system we've gotten rid of
the 1 8 SCU cargo containers everything
is one SCU cargo containers so in the
case of uh the C2 with the six uh 696 Su
that would be 696 one SCU boxes rather
than 5000 plus every single one of those
boxes is a real entity in the game like
any other entity in the game it is
tracked in the database as a persistent
entity now that we have the new
persistent entity streaming architecture
and it means that now that there are
entities that are persistent they can be
interactable so now you can do things
like use the tractor beams to pull them
out of the cargo hold or put them into a
cargo hold it also means that whenever
we do shift destruction with the new
system we don't have to generate
anything instead all that we do is we
take the entities that were already
created and we just simply detach them
from the cargo hold and let them float
in space now we still want to have some
of that explosive destruction so there's
a certain amount of variable amount of
that cargo that is destroyed on ship
destruction actually giving you back
somewhere it's actually zero to ninety
percent uh but that's calculated every
time your ship explodes so what happens
then is now we're still now we're
actually hitting that 40 to 50 number on
average this means that both four
players that want to reclaim the cargo
that they lost on ship destruction or
for pirates that want to scoop up their
their ill-gotten gains then they'll have
an easier time to get at it and they'll
be more value there when they try to do
so there's also the new commodity kiosk
flow which is a step in the right
direction for helping you understand
what you're buying and what you're
selling and what's available at the
places where you buy and sell
Commodities there's a new UI it's the
new building block UI so it should be a
lot easier to understand and gives you a
graphical representation as you're
buying and selling of how much space
that you have on the ship that you're
buying and selling into
318 is not the uh the end of the cargo
refactor there's lots of stuff that
we're you know in the design process for
right now including manual loading and
unloading as well as automatic loading
and unloading
um we're also looking at some big box
cargo missions that separate the the
cargo from the hauling professions so
that's something to look forward to we
have a lot more content coming that use
these new features we hope you enjoy it
in 318.
and as a coded to all of that Chris
Roberts actually came by my desk the
other day and we talked a bit how it was
unfortunate that we even have to allow
players to lose 40 to 50 percent of the
cargo and we talked and decided that we
would try to come up with an interim
Solution on our path to physicalize
damage that would allow us to leave the
husks of ships behind on vehicle
destruction instead of just exploding
them and erasing all the contents this
would allow players to explore the ships
and find the cargo and physically move
it off the husks of the ships rather
than just generating a percentage of the
boxes on destruction
like every other aspect of star citizens
continuing development the cargo
refactor isn't a one drop and it's done
kind of feature and the first
implementation much like persistent
entity streaming alongside it in the
upcoming Alpha 318 is about rebuilding
existing functionality within an
entirely New Foundation that will now
set the stage for the persistent
Universe to reach its fullest potential
and subsequent patches to come and while
we're here talking about new
technologies designed to be built upon
from one patch to the next let's chat us
up some rastar the internal tool that
we've been developing now that's
currently in use placing outposts
throughout both the Stanton and Pyro
systems
foreign
is to make the thing easier for the devs
to place location at the surface of a
planet and in the end they will be used
as the system for player to build their
phases
we have Rasta because the previous
system based on prefab was quite uh hard
to use and not up to scale for the for
the scale and the scope we want for our
planet density any changes to the
planetary generation like for example
you just change a canyon you add a
canyon to the planet you'll have to
adopt every modules at the surface of a
planet to be sure they are well aligned
with the new terrain and the new
modifications of the terrain rasa makes
that better by allowing first of all the
ability to directly follow the
modification of terrain topology so we
don't have to refresh anything plus it
gives us more granularity and modularity
on the locations
[Music]
because she'd be caring about the rasta
and all this improvements because that's
the way we will be able to give you the
players
the most dense area we can imagine to
keep in line and have all the planets
all the moons filled with POI and things
to do on the surface and maybe later in
orbit of this planet and moons
citizencon
2951 it changed not much in terms of
visual mostly UI rework but features are
all there just a lot of internal work to
allowed the new build location to fits
more and be more productive so now we
can have modules and elements that are
nested and indented so we better
understand what depends on what and we
also added the ability to collapse parts
parts of the tool so
to have a better understanding and more
focused work on some parts of the tool
we also worked on better tools
Integrations so now we are able to use
the base tools of the editors such as
gizmos or roller bar to modify some
elements of raster which was not
possible previously due to some breaking
while doing so and to keep consistency
with the with the raster flow but with
that changes now most of the
in edited tools are usable with Rasta
without any risk we also moved the
object containers used for raster to
streaming object containers to keep in
line with the whole streaming process of
the network system so now we gave the
ability for the server to load and spawn
and despawn some locations and elements
at will to avoid crowding the whole
server memory
and we also now converted the whole
connector system that was presented
during the last citizen con to item
ports
so now again to keep in line with the
in-house way we do things and to better
integrate some elements such as the
Resource Network that will later be
available on their locations
I'm quite happy with the result of rasta
there is quite some work to do on it
but the result is surmising and I'm
pretty sure you're gonna love the
location where you will roll out with
Rasta
[Music]
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that the cargo Factor will
physicalize the manner in which we
transport Goods in such a way that makes
retrieval after disaster or collection
after piracy easier and more rewarding
than ever before that it's the new
foundation for an entirely new trade
experience that will continue to develop
over subsequent patches that it may yet
have some fortunate side effects on
vehicle destruction ship husks and
Salvage in the not too distant future
and that the rastar tool first
introduced a last year's citizen gun is
already being used to populate the
planets of pyro in next year's 4.0 and
Stanton in this December's upcoming
Alpha 318. now don't forget that this
year's Intergalactic Aerospace Expo is
right around the corner you can go to
