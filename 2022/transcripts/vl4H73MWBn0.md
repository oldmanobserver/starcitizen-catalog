star citizen live graphics engineering q
a starring ellie brown
hi everybody
welcome to star citizen live uh graphics
engineering q a i'm your host jared
huckabee and if you've never seen star
citizen live before it's where we take
about an hour out of our friday and
spend time with our developers explore a
bit of their process sometimes put them
on the hot seat and make them face the
questions that come from you our star
citizen uh backer uh this week we have
mr ali brown let me find your there we
go mr ali brown director of graphics
engineering aly how you doing man hello
i'm doing good thank you
uh welcome back to the show it's been a
while
thanks for having me and and and i want
to point out i i want to do this to to
to celebrate ali not to throw everybody
else out but ali actually came to me and
asked to do this show he uh he he saw a
bunch of the ques he saw a bunch of the
questions that folks had uh after uh
citizencon uh about the graphics
presentation and stuff like this and
he's like hey i'd like to do a q a and
talk more to the backers about the stuff
and like i i did that thing where my
eyes turned into like cartoon like what
like the developer came to me and asked
me to do a show so so i want to a pre uh
all of us to put our appreciation out
there and thank ally brown ahead of time
for for coming to us
and asking you the show
now
as we usually do we put up a thread in
uh spectrum uh where we collect
questions from the backers and let
backers vote up the questions that they
want to see answered most
we collected those and
went through them and if i were a
professional i would have had them up on
my screen before i started the show give
me just a second
ally tell us about your childhood
i'm kidding here we go all right so so
right off the bat
uh
ellie the number one question by a wide
margin i mean it wasn't even close uh
had to do with vulcan uh so uh in
general why don't you
start if you can give us a general
status update uh
on vulcan where we're at where we're
going how's it going what can you tell
us
okay so um yeah vulcan is obviously
going to be the back end of our new
renderer which we've called gen12 um and
the vulcan side of it is going pretty
well um but ultimately it's limited by
our progress on the gen12 renderer until
that's complete vulcan can't be complete
so at the moment we've uh as we've been
developed on the gen 12 when we're very
vulkan's always been playing catch up
basically just as soon as something
works the new renderer we look at vulcan
make sure it works and then bring it
back up to speed so it's just lags ever
so slightly behind so
in terms of like features for the vulcan
render we're probably about 75 something
like that um of that being completed but
probably slightly less when you start
factoring in performance because vulcan
will perform slightly differently to
direct text we were using in the past um
probably a naive type of first
version we run internally might not be
quite as fast but obviously we don't
want to ship that to you we want the
ship the faster version so probably you
know somewhere between 60 and 75
depending on how much performance work
there is
but uh a lot of that has been done
like i said it's playing catch up to gen
12 and gen 12 is progressing very well
now and once we type of which you know
it's not far off and once we finish the
gen 12 aspect we'll throw a bunch of
bodies on the vulcan side and that will
i think very quickly
come up so we're not expecting a big
difference between
gen 12 uh release and then the vulcan
release very soon after
now if i uh correct me if i'm wrong here
uh parts of the gen 12 rendering render
have gone out in previous patches and
even upcoming patches with 317. um
this isn't going to be like a light
switch kind of thing where where one day
there's a patch and suddenly everything
looks differently
no and we would be lovely if we do that
but the type of continuous live release
means to do that we would have to keep
both sets of code in parallel for like a
whole year and it's too painful for to
maintain both when we have constant
features we're working on so as we
finish something uh we live in type of a
experimental stage for a while where we
internally turn it on for the graphics
programmers and then once we're
confident we turn it on for the rest of
studio and then the next patch that
happens to come out will benefit from
that so we've already i think as
citizencom you already mentioned that
all the post effects already converted
we've been focused on getting the
geometry done which is the biggest part
of the game um at the stage we are today
in the in our live uh in our stream
internal uh we have all of the opaque
geometry is kind of done which is the
vast majority of the game uh and then
the shadows are coming straight after
that they're basically done just
awaiting some testing
so um the really the big bits are left
actually is just to deal with the
transparent geometry and then a few
miscellaneous effects like i don't know
the blackout effect and and things like
that type of the the final piece of
polish um
but yeah the hard parts have been
largely tackled i mean transparency is
still a problem there's plenty of issues
there but
the bulk of it is type of making very
good progress and won't be too much
longer
so i just wanted to be clear that uh we
want to reiterate again before we move
on that this is already
coming out and releasing in parts and
sections of it are turning on and stuff
like this so they so so backers are
already seeing the work and results of
some aspects of it they'll see more
aspects of it in 317 they'll see more
aspects of it in 318. and then there
will be a release we'll have more this
year yeah it's faster and faster
so there will just be
a time when it's like okay that
everything has now been converted over
but it but it again it won't be like a
big
boom like you logged in on one on
thursday and the game ran one way you
logged in on friday friday now the game
runs a different way it's it's already
in progress it's already happening it's
already releasing it's a little bit
after a little bit after a little bit
kind of thing yeah the minister and
parts of it there will be bigger
differences than other but the problem
is a pc market like pc game everyone's
machine is different so some people will
be bound by that maybe they've got a
really old gpu maybe they've got a
single four core system versus an eight
core system so everyone's gonna have
different performance characteristics so
there will be some unlucky person
somewhere where gen 12 makes no
difference to them and there'll be
someone else who sees their framework
triple it's it's hard to
give a general rule but the each stage
we expect to see benefits um probably
the biggest ones might come towards the
end because the focus initially is going
to be getting things working getting
things so they don't regress and get
worse in terms of a performance time as
far as the backer seats but in terms of
actual performance improvements maybe
i'll have once it's all working it'll be
like right pylon let's see what's
actually not working as it should in
terms of performance and then the final
uh switch to vulcan is probably the
biggest change and that one is gonna be
a bit of a binary you either use a block
but using vulcan or you're not um
everything else is gonna be more gradual
all right um
next step let's talk about uh uh
let's see if we can hit some like
some general gen 12 vulcan and
performance related stuff all at once
here uh
cpu parallelization and scene rendering
so uh i'm just going to read this
directly here am i correct this is the
person asking am i correct to say that
when scene rendering is turned on for
gen 12 and phase one that we will get
some level of cpu render parallelization
other than the parallelization we
already have for visual visual visible
objects across batch workers and cpu
cores or is the parallelization only
coming between phase two and three the
latter being the optimization of the
multi-core scene rendering and bye-bye
render thread completely i'm mainly
asking for the sake of high core count
low single clock speed cpu users
so that's quite a technical question um
yeah so
yeah each stage will get improvements in
that regard for the people that have
high core core counts low low clock
speed um
the parts many parts of the render are
outwardly multi-threaded um and
basically the gen 12 work is moving more
and more to them multi-threaded stages
and less and less work ends up having to
be done on the single core what what
this person's correctly called our
render for head which is which will
always remain on a single core but in
the final final version of vulcan it
will do almost no work so everything
else will be paralyzed but yeah it will
be every every single milestone will
give benefits so every release we expect
from now until the job's 100 finished
you'll get an improvement
uh while we're hitting you with the big
ones let's just get some of the big ones
out of the way here uh will the game
always be so cpu intensive or will it
move to a gpu intensive uh uh scenario
at some point
so
the goal of gen12 is to remove a large
chunk of the cmp cpu work so that will
naturally mean it's more gpu bound um
but even if there was no cpu cost from
from the graphics team from my
department the rest of the game is still
big and complicated you know it's a very
ambitious game so
uh there's lots of work by all the other
teams uh to reduce the cpu load and
yeah i mean the engine team in the game
team it's an ongoing thing that it's
constant work to improve the performance
uh massive strides have been made but at
the same time the game's growing so you
see you know what might be minor
improvements but actually
if we hadn't been adding features you
would be probably getting a much faster
frame it but you know the game has to be
completed so
yeah um i'd imagine do all these
relatively intense cpu work on this game
compared to a much more simple platform
or something but
yeah we we want to move into position
where we're gpu bound from our team
that's what we want and then we're type
of limiting factor and then we can
you know we can push the gpu effects
harder then for the people that have
gpus that can handle it and then we can
scale it back and give people a good
frame rate that they don't have uh such
powerful gpus
so yeah i think so i think we will move
to be more gpu intensive but
we have to be realistic that it's a
complicated game they'll always have a
decent amount of cpu load yeah
it's it's it's interesting because
there's an interesting challenge because
we are running a live environment in the
middle of
our attempt to make the game so it's
it's you you you you you build the
universe out as it is and then you do
something that makes it less cpu
intensive and and puts more in the gpu
and it's great but we don't just stay
there we then add more to the game more
features to the game more places the
game more things that end up being cpu
intensive and then you have to work to
bring that that new stuff over to the
cpu and then somebody comes in and adds
more stuff to the game which adds more
cpu stuff and it's like okay let's move
to let's see what we can do to move that
you know on there so it's this it's this
constant uh uh neverending challenge of
development here uh because even after
the day when we go live and we say 1.0
and stuff development of star citizen
doesn't stop you know we we keep moving
we keep adding more planets we keep
adding more systems i mean this train
doesn't stop so so it's it is going to
be a forever challenge
uh for your team and all the teams all
the performance teams to just constant
to constantly not just optimize for
what is there today but to continuously
you know improve on everything else that
comes tomorrow
eventually it becomes
slightly easier um the initial you know
we've done a lot of building a lot of
core technology um as we get further
along we'd hope there wouldn't be so
much
core type of foundation like building
the structures that allow us to build
the universe it'll be more hopefully
game features you know iterating on the
phone adding more like mechanics um
which should hopefully not be as
intensive you know you're either mining
or you're hacking you're either shooting
or you're you know
whatever the mechanics are
they hopefully won't pile up forever um
that's maybe different to the gpu side
we'll constantly add visual effects you
know for whatever
machines can handle we'll add it but uh
yeah hopefully on the game side which is
where we've struggled with cpu uh speed
that was e slightly but we'll yeah the
game's gonna always be growing and
if the cpus can handle it there will be
no reason not to
add more complexity
yeah i i i think it's i think it's safe
to say it's in our dna we're going to
push this stuff as far as it goes we're
going to keep pushing it so there's
there's not likely to ever be just open
overhead we're going to keep pushing
that that's in our dna here
uh let's see next question here when
vulcan support does get implemented are
you expected to look further into mesh
shader pipeline and the benefits within
um my shaders are something that
certainly interests me greatly uh that
we would really love to look at um
one thing we maybe have to temper that
with is that the adoption rate currently
isn't huge among the market um for this
new technology i think
rough numbers i mean maybe 30 or
something of our player base um but
that's obviously going to grow over time
and
we also have to take in by the time you
actually make the technology that the
adoption rate would increase by the time
you release it but still we have to be
careful in what we use it for like if we
made the use of these new mesh shaders
which is a new way of
building and rendering geometry if that
was our core only
method of rendering geometry we would
lose half our player base and that would
be a huge
storm so we have to be wary that that's
not a possibility now you can use it for
optimizations which is one of the main
benefits but also then you're benefiting
an optimization to the highest power
gpus that may not actually
need it that much um so it's a difficult
question the ideal use is something that
can type of improve the visuals but then
the people with the greater power gpus
with the more modern gpus get to see
these new visuals but somehow doesn't
impact the experience of the the
slightly less powerful gpus to still
play the game um we really want to cut
people off but there's not so much and i
don't know very interpreted as holding
back um it's more bang for buck you know
if we're not doing messages we're doing
something else we're doing some of the
benefits as many people as we can but at
some point the tide will turn and the
benefits will be clearer by using mesh
haters than they will by focusing
elsewhere so it's definitely something
that's very interesting for us and
there's a few areas we've been uh
discussing that we would like to use
them potentially but yeah gen 12 is the
focus so type of that's one light until
gen 12 shift
okay
um this may be a little outside your
wheelhouse but we'll
we'll try it we'll see what we get
has there been any internal testing of
linux using vulcan
this person is using vulcan the backdoor
question about linux basically so um
yeah well i'll pre-phase it with uh i
generally don't have much involvement
with linux that'll be more engine team
and other stuff but i do know aspen um
so in the graphics team internally i
don't want an extent i think most of our
guys don't win linux for the game
however
and gen 12 is our focus and windows
support um however
i know some of our employees have played
the game and frequently play it via i'm
told lucas and proton are the libraries
they use on the next um and that they
get reasonable performance already now
switching to vulcan will make that
existing method of running
uh linux much faster and should you know
theatrically give you uh comparable or
even better performance on linux so
i mean i'm not sure if that's the only
way we'll support this i'm not sure if
there's gonna be a native client that's
a question for somebody else for engine
team or cr but but i'm told there was
there was a way and that way it's going
to get faster with linux but we haven't
tested ourselves yet um linux type of
sorry the vulkan sport isn't a point
where you could directly compare a to b
like i said we're missing the
transparent geometry at the moment so
it'll be a bit unfair to compare like
it might even run faster you've been
missing parts of the game so
until the type of got vulcan finished is
only one point we'll be able to do a
fair comparison
um
uh and i'll probably just sit in there
just because people ask um i'm told and
again this is not my area but there
isn't uh an issue with vulcan at the
moment easy enter cheat which i believe
epic are looking into and there was sdks
being released uh in the coming months
and when they are released we'll be
integrating them to try and resolve that
issue um but again outside my sphere of
knowledge i'm just dumping information i
knew there would be linux questions so
yeah yeah it's it's
i saw it and i'm like this is like a
1980s sitcom backdoor question where
they're they're they're trying to use
the topic of one thing to back door a
subject or another but i figured you
know i can i could you know every once
in a while
uh let's move into some we got some
questions here that are mostly about uh
keeping visuals up to date uh uh one of
the um
ongoing concerns uh because our game has
been in development uh for a while and
because we've been running a live
environment during that development
since 2013 when the hangar module that
came out
lots of questions have to do with
how you're going to keep things up to
date so uh with the dev cycle being so
long for star citizen how do you deal
with the ever changing graphics tech and
rework and still keep moving forward
so
i think every aaa studio with its own
engine has this the same challenge
really keeping up to date um
they constantly have to make new post
effects as new technology or new ideas
come about
in the industry
so
that's not massively different to us to
any other type of
i don't want to name them but i'm sure
you'll know of the type of the ones that
aren't part of massive using big engines
or have multiple studio uh publishers um
but yeah i don't see that being
massively different uh we only have a
couple of differences internally and one
is we can't wipe the slate clean every
couple of years when we release the game
or however frequent a big studio might
so we can't say well that was good we we
did mostly good but we didn't like that
technology so we're gonna next time we
need a different one we have to build
that while we're while we're running we
have to build the next version of
whatever it is so that that doesn't
introduce some complexities uh but
overall it's not especially for the
graphics team it's not been a problem
for us um most things are straight
replacements you know you replace the
old bloom effect for a new bloom effect
you replace the old shader with a new
shader it's not a a major problem and
that's it
you know i've been in a very uh quick
dev cycle on a previous company and it's
not that much different i don't find a
major challenge the one point that i
would say is different though is the art
the art pipeline and the artwork we have
so
we have to maintain everything that's
been built we can't say oh we've done
this new technology but these five
spaceships don't work anymore that's
just not an option so
everything we make has to remain
backwards compatible and what we tend to
do is
save for the art pipe and make a new
shader that can do i don't know like the
tint system for the spaceship so we can
more easily roll out new skins
it may not work in an old spaceship but
we have to that system won't work an old
spaceship we'll ship two versions of the
shader the new one the old one and then
somebody when they get the chance we'll
go back to that ship assign the new
shader maybe fix up anything then he's
fixing up and then then we're good again
but
you know we can't demand that they work
at the same frequency so we'll do the
new technology and they will opt into it
when they get round to it which you know
might be the next week it might be a few
months but eventually these things
uh and once we get close to type of like
you know 80 adoption we'd have to poke
people with a stick to try and
get over the hurdle so we can delete the
old technology and that's constantly
happening we have lots of different
technologies that are type of
in-progressive type of being rolled out
across the assets so that's the biggest
issue but it's not really a technology
issue it's more of a data management
issue with the size of the content of
the game which is very huge i don't even
know how many spaceships we have now but
it's
yeah big numbers
it's a lot uh no it it it's a it's an
issue that that
people who have played other mmos uh at
least the mmos that have survived uh for
a while see it's just the the the the
world of warcraft or or star wars old
republic or star trek online just i'm
trying to think of the sci-fi ones that
are out there uh
you know they're they're all they're
they're constantly making updates
replacing shaders uh and stuff like this
that they don't they don't throw out
their engine and start with another
engine it is constantly you know adding
and upgrading and and and just you know
just you know swapping parts out
eventually you know you start getting
into the ship a thesis conversation
where have you replaced every every part
at some point is it still the original
one uh and that's a question for video
game philosophers not for
uh
dummies like me who just talk on the
video
let's move to another one
here's an interesting follow-up
will star citizen graphics get outdated
or surpassed by other engines like
unreal five lots of chat about unreal
five in the uh in the chat because
that's the current hotness
yeah i mean
similar questions the previous one in in
regard that
every developer that is not using unreal
or or any big engine is going to have
that same
question uh uh and
it's it's not really that different to
be honest than the last 10 15 years you
know maybe since you know say unreal
three came around you know when we
started to see these big engines and
also the publishers that have
been joining more devs together
so i don't think it's anything new this
obviously that always was going to be
the big new shiny thing and some company
not always the unreals but sometimes
it'll be the other devs will come up the
new shiny thing and everyone will learn
from that and they'll trial it and
that will look at the you know success
or failure of that engine that game and
see if that technology survives test of
time and if it does other studios will
naturally
you know make their own version of that
and absorb it into their pipeline um so
you have this i think that's just the
natural ebb and flow of the industry
somebody will push head in one area the
other people will eventually catch up
it's continuous i don't think it's
always one engine though i um
there is things that the large companies
can push
much harder on which like i say the
tooling um
because they are selling a product to
use their engine for people that maybe
are not even professional game devs
sometimes so they have to make the
tooling very powerful and easy to use
it's less of a focus when you have you
know professional devs
uh they're very used to the engine um so
yeah it's it's something i'm not gonna
pretend that we don't look at say uh the
latest ue5 technology and see that
that's pretty good you know there's some
really impressive stuff there uh the
mana in particular is very interesting
but
yeah i'm not particularly worried as
long as we continue to develop our
engine as long as we continue to
maintain and grow our graphics team and
keep up the latest technology yeah we
will be there just yeah it just doesn't
mean that the day after unreal
implement98 we're gonna implement
tonight
and there is sometimes obviously when
the latest thing comes down
there is always this and we're not
talking about nana here specifically
just in general but
the assumption that that solves all of
life's problems and then you wait six
months or a year and you find out that
it solves a subset of problems it's not
you know it's not the solution to
everything um there is many aspects
uh to a full package of full engine like
we've got all unreal
so as long as we continue to maintain
the engine and grow the graphics team
and everything we should have no issue
keeping up with the you know cutting
edge
i think so yeah i mean our visuals are
still cutting edge now those areas the
engine that we have we are extremely
proud of that will uh match or surpass
our vendors and those areas that are not
as good that we need to improve um
so i i don't see a major issue there um
and for example
they've picked unreal so i'll talk about
that but the nanite tech with it
improves the type of quality of geometry
that that's super powerful in some areas
it's it's a benefit everywhere but the
main thing is type of natural geometry
so for planets and things like this that
could be a great benefit but it doesn't
do
as much for some other types of geometry
internal spaces and i think our quality
on our type of interiors has been
extremely high for a number of years and
matches any other game i see so
you know
it's not that we don't want much better
you know natural geometry but
yeah we'll get there um
yeah but i'm not worried yeah as long as
we you know maintain the development
maintain the team as long as you're not
going to fire tomorrow we're all good
right
one more question on the topic kind of a
follow-up here uh i'm glad you said the
main the the the maintaining anything
because that's literally this question
uh
the game in his engine has already
allowed the graphics to evolve massively
compared to the original kickstarter
days but can this be maintained to keep
up with modern titles does the engine
have
a limit
it was there going to be a point where
we can't
improve
so
i don't think so it's almost the
opposite um first off like an engine
isn't a single thing obviously that has
a limit you hit it and then you stagnate
or you kind of replace it it's many many
different subsystems and subsystems of
the subsystems
and these like i mentioned before are
being constantly iterated or replaced uh
and that's not a problem that's not
wasted that's just the natural evolution
of software um
so in terms of where can we maintain it
i think it's the opposite i think we're
accelerating quite quickly i think
the initial years was finding out of say
for the graphics team is finding our
feet we obviously inherited a code base
and
learning that and then brought more
people on board to have a better
understand and start to develop that
code base and
more recently on the graphics side we'll
obviously replace the renderer so now it
is 100
hours uh i i understand our
understanding of every nook and cranny
of it
um and then once that's done
with type of uh our rate is going to be
much greater be able to keep up with new
technology um and that's the big
motivator for gen 12 and the performance
was one but the secondary one was to be
able to adapt uh to new technology and
create new pieces of uh new features
much more quickly so yeah i think
actually again as you know assuming the
team stays the same or grows in size
we've got plenty of
uh capacity now to
develop things much quicker than we have
done in the past and we need to
obviously because to keep up with the
big engines but yeah
uh i'm not considering that way i think
we're going to be
pushing a lot more visuals in the coming
years
uh chat is having a bit of a row about
the difference between gen 12 renderer
and dx12
uh are
are we doing dx12 are we not doing dx12
what what's this
no
immediate reason for the dx12 we picked
the gen 12 name
well we started planning this render
long before we'd necessarily settle 100
on vulcan and
it would we just depict something um so
you know dx12 was type of has a
numbering system um at the time vulcan
and the other apis didn't happen in wing
so it's like 12. everyone understood
what dx12 was in the industry so we went
with something that had the number 12 in
it um it helps pin down to this piece of
tech and then the next one if you call
it the new renderer then you have the
new new end or the better renderer so
it's called gen12 um but you know in the
end we decided the vulcan was the the
better choice for us because of the the
linux aspect and a few other
uh technology points of view made it
slightly better for us um but it wasn't
a big deal it wasn't you know we could
have gone dx 12 but at the moment
there's no pressing reason for us to
implement the x12 um we could it
wouldn't be a huge effort um
put a couple of guys on it for some
number of months and you would
eventually uh pop that out but unless we
have a reason to believe there was some
new technology on dx12 or
or some platform or something that
required that there is no reason for us
to really go there at the moment so for
now there's no plans for directx 12 but
the engine is set up in a way that we
very much could implement another api if
we needed to you know if the success of
the vulcan comes along or
the x-13 is is the thing that we need to
make the world better then we will do
that
fair enough
all right let's get let's let's move
more into like life in in the game and
how this stuff actually like manifests
and and stuff for players in the game uh
right off the bat
will we have more refined graphics
settings soon uh currently our options
are very limited and somewhat confusing
um yeah i have to admit we've not spent
a great deal of effort there as you'll
probably see from the comment but the
we've been holding off for a while
because of we were mostly cpu bound then
graphics options are generally to try to
squeeze out performance um generally you
know we generally want at the highest
quality most time and
and it's only to scale back and mostly
would not be gpu bound so there wasn't a
huge deal huge motivation for
scaling the engine back um all the folks
have been getting the cpu cost down
which is what the servers need it's what
the clients need
so that's been the focus and then
implementing gen 12 changes the way
the render works so it would change the
way we'd expose the options so if we're
going to get 1012 done and then we're
going to have a fresh look at these
options they will probably have quite a
radical change we're going to simplify
them a lot but then also
we'll have an advanced section they'll
be much more complicated than we have
now but um
yeah at the moment i think there's four
different quality settings but we're
gonna maybe change that up maybe reduce
that a bit but then um the memory
management is something we're probably
gonna push much further
yeah but yeah we're definitely gonna
have a whole bunch of new options and
make sure that the options we have give
you some meaningful change some of the
settings we have there you can change
things to high or low reduce draw
distance to increase them you'll find
that the frame rate doesn't really
change and it's a point they're saying
so why have it so we're going to set
them based on what it needs to change
the frame rate by a certain fraction so
you know high or might be 20 slower than
medium and low might be 20 faster
that would be the motivation and if it
doesn't change performance we won't
expose it
okay
um
so far up to that while we're in the
graphics settings options here uh would
it be possible to add a windowed
borderless mode to the graphics setting
vastly improves the quality of life for
multi-monitor users which is a fairly
substantial part of the player base
so
we already support a borderless window
mode but um i'm going to gather because
they've talked about multi-monitor
they're probably meaning that i think it
centers onto your main monitor at the
moment and it locks the resolution of
your center monitor so you can't drag
that out to spam two or three monitors
and customize the resolution if you
don't say if you've got three 4k
monitors maybe you don't want to run at
12k
uh unless you've got a monster gpu so
yeah um yes definitely it's a bit of an
embarrassment we haven't quite got to
that yet that's definitely something
that's very high on our priority list to
post that to fix his stream as soon as
gen12 was done um yeah so resolution
scaling and then picking you the size of
the monitor and let you uh the window
and let me move it around yeah
yeah definitely yeah it it
there is some version of it there but it
doesn't have the features that a lot of
people
expect it to have and internally we all
um
we already have the resolution scaling
which is one aspect of it that people
have been asking for as well but that
doesn't quite work why you are yet so
there's just a few bugs there and then
the changing of the size of it shouldn't
be a complicated issue so yeah i can't
can't give an exact time frame but it it
definitely will be we'll be looking at
that very
soon
i tend to play almost everything in
windowed borderless because i need to
switch over to teams or email or
something on another monitor very easily
uh you know because you know just in the
middle of the day cr will ping me or
something i just i just gotta i always
have to keep an eye on the left on the
left screen while i'm playing on the
middle so windows borderless makes that
makes that experience a lot easier for
me there can be some quite uh
technical differences between when you
run the the full screen uh borderless
and the exclusive full screen you get
it depends on lots and lots of factors
but there is changes in performance
potentially one depending on your system
either could be faster and is also
changing the latency as well uh
generally full screen exclusive is less
latency
but yeah
a pain when you're getting messaged by
someone and
you know discord or something and you
want to alt tab well i i i don't i don't
ever worry about latency i i suck at any
latency so it doesn't matter
it's
a couple fractions of a second aren't
gonna isn't the difference between me
being good enough or not i'm just bad
um uh
are there any plans to let us turn off
temporal aaa or and get rid of the
ghosting that it brings
ah that's a funny one
so
i got halfway through it i was like
yeah so temporal aaa anti-aliasing um is
one form of what we call a temporal
accumulation system it uses data from a
previous frame to basically just make
things cheaper it opens the door to a
whole host of new technologies now
anti-aliasing is one of them and the
most obvious but it actually is a major
way we can reduce noise in all of our
rendering um and also it can help you
introduce blending effects you can blend
between two things like for example uh
currently our planet uh terrain uses the
temporal blending to blend between all
the different ground textures
so
in terms of turning off temporal a if
you turn it off then you don't just turn
off anti-lacing you turn off all the
temporal blending system so you'll get
noisy shadows noisy occlusion
no blending on the terrain
so yeah it's not quite as simple as
turning it off and this is an
unfortunate reality of modern rendering
and you'll find that in many engines
like 78 of them is the case because it
gives you so much performance um
it lets you spend it on everything else
and usually it's only type of quite
bespoke quite uh
narrower focused games that can afford
to not use it and can blow the you know
bandwidth on a different form of a
that's usually more expensive like msa
so
unfortunately probably a hard off at the
moment is not possible um we can
potentially expose the option but it
would probably have to come out if we
did that for massive warning that what
you're about to do is going to break the
visuals you know what i don't want to
see is the graphics moment we're seeing
pictures of our game looking awful and
broken and people posted look how bad
this game looks so
um but maybe there's a halfway house
maybe we can maybe there's decrease the
strength of it but with a warning that
you know some effects will become more
noisy as a result of that so you'd think
that it's
you know just gonna make the image
crisper or type of sharper but actually
you'll be degrading it in other ways
um
yeah um so
maybe not a hard off but there might be
some some flexibility now we can have a
look at that when we look at the
graphics options to see if there's
something that makes sense um
yeah
it's a tricky one though it's an
unfortunate reality nobody likes temple
ia in the company like no especially ui
people hate it because of the potential
messengers um
uh yeah you'll find everyone from vfx
hates it because it kind of smudges out
their particle effects it's not a nice
thing
nobody appreciates alternative but it's
amazing what it can do it is vastly
superior to the alternative
so it's tricky
but maybe you know some people some
people just want the image sharp as
having like sharpening controls or
tweaking that is okay but the ghosting
the ghosting is specifically which this
person mentioned is tricky because that
is a product of using the data from the
previous frame in an area screen where
you don't have data from the previous
frame so if you turn the camera quickly
or somebody runs in front of you
you don't know what was there previously
so you have to make it up and basically
what you're seeing when there's the
ghosting is sometimes actually the lack
of temporal data so that's type of a
clue as to what you might get if you
didn't have temporary so yeah for any
issue
it's just going to move very slowly
yeah um we'll see what we can do see if
there's something that can happen when
we look at the graphics options you can
kind of help with that
this person enabled auto hdr on windows
11 and says it looks extremely good can
we expect native hdr in the future did i
say hdr the first time or did i say
something else
they enabled auto hdr in owner's eleven
it looks good can we expect native hdr
in the future
yes absolutely um so we already support
hdr through most of the pipeline you
know all the rendering is hdr um
unfortunately there was two things that
we left to do to complete that um one is
our color processing so
uh generally what happens is you you
produce your image in a high dynamic
range and then you crunch it down to a
low dynamic range which is the bit you
know hdr needs to modify um but then we
then color correct it just like you
would in a film you like adapt the
colors you try and produce a mood
and that process is
built in low dynamic range and as a
result of that it's
it's not and it's an art because an
artistic process we can't just turn it
into hdr it needs to go back to art we
need type of review how would they would
like to do this color equation in hdr
it's a reasonably known problem other
studios have tackled it
but that's just the piece we haven't got
to um
and then there is a minor bit of work
into like making sure that it works in
all the different types of hdr there is
so many different formats and so many
different blindness screens and monitors
of you have to do a bit of careful q a
to make sure that you actually get good
results um there's no point just testing
on my
fancy hdr screen and then having a
natural consumer one might actually look
good so
yeah there's two two little bits to
finish off and uh the
continuing theme here is
after gen 12 we really just want to get
gen 12 done but yeah that that's quite
high on the list um it initially was not
as important because hdr monitors were
relatively rare for the pc market
compared to consoles which you'd play on
a tv which tends to support hdr um but
it's definitely become a lot more
popular now
yeah
uh see uh while we're on graphics things
we got a nice little collection of
graphic settings questions here um
will you add an option to turn camera
based motion blur off but keep
object-based motion blur on
yes
and i'm slightly ashamed that we don't
i know that uh digital family friends uh
have pushed hard for that and yeah um
yeah clearly um the camera motion blur
is uh
contentious to say the least um object
motion blur has some
some public backing far more than the
camera motion blur which is
notoriously
hated by a lot of people
good for cinematics great cinematics
makes it amazing wonderful for
cinematics
yeah while you're in the fast-paced
action uh it's controversial yeah and i
think i think there is a
slider i don't i can't know what's
exposed we have type of ability to tone
it down but yeah most people were just
like off i don't want that part of it it
doesn't add anything
um but things like um character
animations and gun reloads and stuff can
look a lot better with some object
motion blur if it's
you know at the right level not too in
your face
we just optimized the game until it was
at 240 frames a second and then your eye
does it for you
the human eye can't see more than 60
frames a second
i'm just kidding right true i'm just
kidding
we don't have a frame rate
why do i poke the bear sometimes i don't
know
i have a pulse control problem
um
as players consider gpu purchases
should they expect vram usage to keep
increasing as the game is developed
that's a just one um so
we've had to be quite careful in the
past with the amount of video memory use
we have you know backers that are backed
early on that don't have quite so
powerful gpu so um they don't hold us
back we're just trying to make sure that
we type of don't rule them out of the
game so we've been quite smart in how
we've used the memory and we make sure
that they're still able to win the game
obviously the performance will be not as
good on their machines um
so yeah i think with three to four gigs
you can run the game quite comfortably
and get decent visuals um so and i think
type of the four gig region will stay
running the game quite nicely for quite
some time
um
i don't think there's a technology
reason why the minimum needs to increase
but what will happen is
we have all these different pools of
memory and how much use for textures how
much use for geometry and so on and the
type of the core amount remember you
need to run
everything without textures without
measures is increasing over time and
eventually
out of your four gigs if we end up with
three gigs to do the bare basics
then your one gig left won't give you a
lot of textures in a lot of geometry
you'll still be able to run the game but
eventually yeah you'll start getting
diminishing returns eventually um uh and
there's elements of that already like
when we added planets gas clouds these
things all took up memory so i think gas
clouds are budgets like 300 megs 400 x
or something so that has to come from
somewhere and if your machine doesn't
have it you're getting less of something
to pay for that
now one thing we are going to do is with
gen 12 um as a necessity of the way
vulkan works the memory management is
much more explicit basically rather than
uh directx or nvdon video intel managing
the memory for you it's left largely to
yourself as a developer but as a result
of that we're going to be or we are much
more strict with how we use the memory
and what we're going to do is what a few
other games have done this type of
expose that to you in the advanced
graphics options so you can see exactly
what memory using and type of balance
that as you see fit so if you want you
want your more textured memory and then
you will sacrifice something else then
that's your choice and you can dab of
see how this is
how we're adapting rather than being
hidden from you slightly at the moment
and the other thing that a lot of people
maybe don't realize is resolution you
run the game has a huge impact on the
map memory so when i'm saying like four
gigs is okay if you're trying to win the
game you know 8k or 4k widescreen or
something you are taking a huge amount
of memory for the bare bones just
getting the screen rendered without any
geometry or textures in there so you
leave very little room for them
so
if we expose it to you and show it to
you you'll be much more clear and people
with that don't have as much memory will
be able to make a smarter decision how
they want to use it if they're
interested obviously we'll have
automatic settings do our best job but
yeah should you want to delve into that
so to answer the question yes vram used
to will steadily increase but i don't
think i'm minimum will increase
for a while i think it will be quite
stable for quite some time um especially
the four gig region is gonna be okay
but yeah um we definitely want to be
able to push to the eight
you know
and more eventually as as you know
and we need to because like for example
the consoles have you know
more memory than four gigabytes
significantly so and we need to be
beating them so
yeah
we need to use it but we just need to
keep something in but in reserve for the
uh for the
for the four gig people
all right so let's uh uh
let's move out of the graphics options
and into the the the the graphics as
people experience them in the games here
uh what they actually see on the screens
uh
right off the bat here how are you
planning
on handling the graphical toll as
players enter a system when multiple
space stations millions of objects
thousands of players all in one location
uh current because currently
xenothreat
can sometimes cause a rather nifty uh
powerpoint presentation uh for people uh
sometimes even when they there's like
less than 30 hanging around
um
so
i think a lot of that will be cpu issues
usually i mean it would have to profile
each case but when we've looked at
things like zenfra it's nearly always a
cpu cost um
and generally if you know say in a space
battle like xenophob you know in terms
of polygon count it can't be that high i
mean you're in space like there was a
limit to what you can see on screen um
even if half the screen is filled with
space that gives you an enormous amount
of budget to spend
you know on the bizarre arm space um so
yeah we do have some things like gas
clouds which are more expensive in space
but otherwise it's not usually a gpu
concern in space it's a cpu now
uh to be the same drum again gen 12 is
one of the major parts of the solution
for cpu performance but it's not the
only part and when it comes to
xenothread that will be the game code
there will be a lot happening there
there'll be a lot of lasers firing a lot
of ai there'll be a lot of all sorts of
things happening and the optimization
there is largely going to come from the
game teams i think um obviously as we're
moving
as much as we can from the rendering
side of it from the graphics the cpu
cost of that will free up more time for
them uh but ultimately i think we'll get
to a point where we'll will get better
but then it'll be on to their teams type
of then take the mantle and push it
further
so um yeah
i think we can handle it for the graphic
side uh we will as we do gentiles we'll
definitely improve how easily we can
handle it but then the game team and the
engine team will have to
continue to optimize which they're doing
every day there's constant emails
work being done on that side
it's a it's a good uh chance to remind
uh folks
that i was reading the question from the
backer so
you know the though those when
the backers the one who said thousands
of players all in one location that is
not
your opportunity to run to reddit and
say disco said there'll be thousands of
people in one location
i was reading the question from the
backer
okay
that's the pact between you and me
you mean you no
no no no i'm talking to the people who
are watching that stuff
no reddit thread about how jared said
there were going to be 10 000 people in
one place that's not what i said i read
the question as the backer wrote it
hold on hold on i gotta give me a second
alley i gotta do this i gotta make sure
people to understand
[Music]
all right
and because you guys did so good because
because we have this pat
i'm gonna ask the question you guys have
been waiting for
will there ever
be practical night vision that players
can use
well
much in the same vein where you have
don't want to promise thousands of
players to the backers um i can't
promise game design
issues um
so
i think there's various game designs are
interested in it but i will not speak on
their behalf
but what i can do is talk about night
vision implementations and how it's done
and leave it to the designers as to what
that means in star citizen
so in terms of night vision almost every
game
up until the last couple of years has
done the same thing which is make the
screen go a bit green change the colors
a little bit
brighten it up a little bit and job done
there's your night vision um
you know so that's fine um it it you
know we can do that no problem um
but recently we started to see people
going a little bit further um
and i don't think has played the call of
duty modern warfare but they did a
significantly better implementation um
it's worth looking up but they they
really push the boat a little bit
further and try to emulate exactly what
night vision
does or particular model of night vision
they do the spectral stuff right yeah so
um
now
they type of better approximate what
each color looks like when looked at
under infrared uh the infrared color so
they type of convert the colors that you
would see well that we know an artist
says this is going to be a
red can
they do the maps and figure out what
that looks like under infrared camera
um and the other thing they do is for
things that have uh particularly
non-standard type of uh
unexpected type of brightness in
infrared like a reflector or you know
red light or or whatever either certain
materials that reflect very brightly
they would the artists have marked this
up so they have this data to give you
the much more convincing
uh visual so yeah that's definitely in
the vein and one we the one thing we
have to be careful of is the amount of
artwork we have means we can't just
go and ask the artist to go and flag up
every single material they've ever
looked at um but we do already have
various markup on materials so that we
know
the rough surfaces that the types of
things they're made of so we can
retrospectively type say oh all the ones
were made of metal this is how they
should respond all the ones that are
made of like you know reflective strips
they respond like this so
there should be scopes to do something
like that um and that's definitely what
aspire to
i can't promise because we're not doing
that right now and until
design say today is the day you make
the night vision mode um that's the day
i can talk more freely about it but yeah
it'd definitely be an interesting thing
i'd love to explore
all right so uh uh what i'll tell
backers right now is the is the next
time we have the opportunity to talk to
todd pappy oh well we'll squeeze that
question in there and and see what he
has to say
um
what are the technical limitations on
the cloud volumes introducing noise when
being viewed uh from a near horizontal
angle
uh so did read that right
there so yeah um
so the the cloud technology is something
our engine director has been pirating
for some time so i want to care for a
second i want to speak on his behalf um
many different things we talked about i
mean my remit but this is definitely his
baby um but i do know a bit about how
it's implemented so i can speak a little
bit on it um
so
the clouds are built from there's many
different stages that go into that
process to build the clouds um
and each of them say i can't remember
it's a five or six different stages each
of them
has been rnd and multiple different
alternative solutions for them and
we're constantly finding new ways and
prove ways to replace each section and
the noise in particular particular at
the um horizontal angle we mentioned
is because the way the clouds work in
our engine and most of us is you type of
you have like an imaginary way that's
fires through enter the distance and
type of you sample or you you take
samples along that point along that way
so say i take 50 samples between here
and the horizon and i ask i want some
calculation to decide how much cloud
cover there is each of these points then
add them all up and i eventually come up
with the final contribution of clouds
but if you imagine if you're looking
from orbit straight down or from the
ground straight up the amount of cloud
cover you see versus looking
horizontally is like hugely different
like you know you can look through like
100 kilometers of clouds versus one
kilometer if you look straight up
so when you're winning say 50 samples
over 100 kilometers there is like a huge
amount of error and that would show as
like type of a stepping blocky artifact
but
to so you don't see blockiness and
stepping we randomize the where we
sample that ray so it turns into noise
so
we have begin to r d solutions that will
vastly improve that there's already many
mechanisms to try and minimize that but
one thing that's showing very good
promise is we kind of do an initial
render basically of the clouds at low
resolution i think it's quarter or an
eighth resolution
try and identify where the cloud is like
where is the noisy parts where is the
most of the detail and then when it
comes to do the main tracing of the
clouds we put all the the
rays and the samples where we need them
so we have without saying oh this part
of the scene is like there's a fringe
here it's like a silver lining on the
cloud that looks really nice but it's
noisy so we'll fire you know many more
samples there and this next part of the
screen would be a big foggy
nothing's happening no point spending
all of our gpu on that so yeah we cut
back on that point so it kind of
optimizes it at the same time as
improving the quality on different areas
of the screen so
that's looking promising um i'd say but
because it's the engine team managing
that
when we're talking about releases and
stuff but it's it's there is definite
improvements coming on that side of
things um
and it's going to continue to be put on
for you know
some time
thank you
um
you see we've we've only got eight
minutes but i think we can squeeze uh
some more and maybe maybe we can go a
little bit over the time here uh
does the rtx does rtx get the team any
closer to figuring out a solution to the
lack of reflective surfaces or mirrors
in the game
uh had to come up didn't it um so yeah
so we have plenty of like
shiny surfaces in the game but i i
gather they mean like
mirror like full-on mirror reflection
like really really
clean um
so
yes i know um
for true mirror-like surfaces ray
tracing is the only sensible way to
solve that problem there's no real
alternative
um
you are however much simpler solutions
for bespoke cases like the many games
where you've seen like water reflection
or a single mirror uh like a typical
mirror and that's stuff they can be
handled just by rendering the scene
again from a different perspective
usually at lower quality of some type of
compromise to stop it being har the
performance
um and they're quite viable and we could
definitely would probably consider doing
that um especially because it's quite
simple and for the mirror case it's a
nice easy way to work um
it does require just a little bit
constraint from the artist not to do
like a hall of mirrors they'd have to
you know you put a mirror in a bathroom
and ideally but when we when we're told
aren't to test this in the past they'll
do it and then behind the bathroom
they'll be like a bengal or something
and you're like no please
put them in a location that's why you
can never give players a handheld mirror
it'll just become a nightmare
yeah i mean you kind of basically could
but you were just half the performance
literally of the game so um yeah
um and the engine although it would you
know you'd hope like a say a handheld
mirror would be smaller
some parts of the engine will
not be able to scale down so like the
number of pixels will be less so that's
great you'll save on something but
there'll be certain aspects the game
will not scale down so
if just one tenth of the screen size
doesn't mean it'll cost ten times less
it might still only cost like fifty
percent of us so you know who wants to
take a 50 frame rate hit to have a
handheld mirror
um so yeah i mean and if you played any
racing games which have rear view
mirrors you'll always see the lower
quality they get in the in the rearview
mirrors or they have such a bespoke
engine to manage that and that's like a
core feature um unfortunately we've got
an extremely complicated game before we
consider mirrors but yeah um so first
for small mirrors like you yeah you'd
probably just render the theme flipped
that is something we've been considering
um it hasn't been a really strong need
for it but there is
uh some news from some departments
asking for it um which is all i'll say
there but the um yeah but for
when you get to the fully general case
like you know seeing your reflection in
a spaceship for curved surface ray
tracing is the only real answer there
uh for some reason there's a person
named donkey aura in chat who just said
all game devs are lazy
uh i've only spent the better part of
eight years proving otherwise but you do
you
uh
will the game get realistic snow weather
that is not identical to dust storms uh
for instance the dust particles on
hurston appear to be the same as on
microtech with just a different color
um
so two parts the answer one is um
i don't know if the dust particles are
literally the same particles on it and
the two examples again there but they
might be the same they might be
different um there is the tech there
already for them to be different uh we
or have a system that type of quite
complicated ground effect system it's
not strict speaking weather it's the
wind kicking up whatever's on the ground
so if there's snow on the ground and
there's a lot of wind it will kick the
snow up and we already have the ability
to do different effects per
uh we call it surface type each type of
material on the ground um so that in
effect could be done now um it's more of
an asset vfx type question from the art
teams
however it's not
to get probably the real answer it's not
snow
it's snow being kicked up in a blizzard
basically um
to get actually uh
strong winds to get a full-on snow full
on weather that's something different um
and it is on our internal road map uh
and
i think a lot of people are quite
excited to get onto that um but it's i
don't have a timeline i can show on at
the moment but yeah it will clearly when
we implement full-on weather that will
be a bespoke effect you know
snow does not look like you know dust
you know it has a specific look and you
know you'd expect rain and all the other
types of weather hail or whatever so
yeah
it's on there it's it's it'll be coming
one day
not today
all right uh before we let you go we got
to get into the
the buzzwords here dlss and fsr
again i'm reading the reading the
question from the backer here
this is planned for later on but i
believe in a spectrum post it was stated
that we may be getting dlss before fsr
due to one manufacturer's popularity
over the other based on statistics my
question stems from one upscaling
technology benefiting everyone whereas
the other benefiting only one party
uh
there is actually no question i guess so
they just want an update on dlss and fsr
and whether one will be coming before
the other one and if it's based on
popularity or something i guess that's
the question they actually forgot to
include a question
that's okay i get that i get a picture
um so yeah i mean those two technologies
um they obviously aim to do a similar
goal but in the way they're implemented
they're completely different
um and they have quite different
performance different quality
uh and different suitability to have the
engine and the problem you're trying to
solve um
and also how easy they are to integrate
um is quite different um
it's they fit into different
type of areas of the pipeline and we
have both of these techniques introduce
a few complications to the engine
because
particularly for ui because
most games you know there's my game
world
uh upscale it slap my ui on my 2d ui and
that says you know how many bullets
you've got or whatever and you're going
and then job done last type of the frame
but our ui is largely in the world and
also we don't have one type ui we have
so many types ui we have you know the
options menu but then other than that we
have like mobile glass which is almost
like a traditional ui but it's not it's
still in the world you can still see
behind you people running up to you
while using it we have the holographic
ship ui we have the mfds we have
uh a type of uh icon of all different
names you haven't but like things that
are in the world type of inner fort they
call it you know when you're gonna talk
to someone and it comes up with the
options
there's so many different types of ui
and none of these play nicely with the
lss or fsr um so there's some work for
us to figure out there
um but yeah as they mentioned the market
share isn't equal one is currently
supporting every
gpu um if they can afford a performance
and the other is on a much smaller
percentage uh i think 30 percentage
might be type of the region you've been
looking at for dlss at the moment
um
so
yeah for me it's not really a question
of a versus b
um they're type of
gonna be considered independently on
their own merits you know can we
implement one how long will it take how
do we implement it um
but yeah i can't pretend that market
share it's definitely a factor though
like you know if we have something
that's going to benefit 99 people or 100
percent of people we want to implement
that over some of the benefits 10 of
people but
on the other side you know
say we implemented one of them and it
didn't give great results we under no
obligation to implement that and i don't
want to
pretend that we haven't or also any
other company hadn't implemented
technology that is only benefiting a
subset of the people you know if we
implement hdr we talked about earlier if
you don't have a hdr monitor tough luck
uh ray tracing don't have uh you know
rtx card or playstation d tough luck uh
in optimizations for one cpu brand or
the other or face over ip these are like
many examples where it benefits a subset
now
you know that's not
that's not great to be benefiting a
subset but you know we wouldn't have any
of them technologies or ever have any of
them if we only tried to satisfy 100 of
the people all the time
so it's more of a
independent decision bang for book i can
see both of them being implemented
um and probably the time tournament is
probably the largest factor to be honest
chat is currently
that's not the right scene what is this
i don't know i heard the wrong scene hi
everybody
uh
a chat is currently saying
it's the wrong button
that was the wrong button
uh chad is currently uh
arguing about whether dlss and uh uh fsr
is better and and and they're getting
pretty contentious there for saying dude
do you want to jump in on the you don't
want to do it i can't answer what is
better or worse um i will leave that i
mean that's technology owned by two
different companies who are integrating
it individually so you know up to them
um but what i will say is
um dlss has a distinct advantage in the
way that it's currently style in that it
is
using
more information that goes into it so it
has a better chance of giving a good
result uh fsr is intentionally
takes less information in so it there's
a limitation to what it can actually
achieve um so there was a fundamental
limitation there now either of them
could change tomorrow you know these are
two independent companies make their own
decisions on
how this technology works but yeah at
the moment it's
it's more the upper limit is higher for
the lss because of
the inputs they take in and that's a
decision you just you just make you know
yeah your technology can work different
ways you know people we talked earlier
about uh temple uh solutions if you use
data from the previous wayne you have a
much better chance of doing a good
result you introduce a whole bunch of
potential issues with ghosting
and you'll get one person that thinks
that's a fair trade-off and other people
that think that's not a good trade-off
so yeah it's not a subject of what is
better but the if you had a static
camera
then having
the more information theaters gives you
a chance of giving a better image
but i'll leave it to the public to
decide what's actually better
okay let's uh let's get some last ones
in that we're technically a little bit
over time but if you're game just a
handful more here um
will we see hud visibility improvements
this is always the
the perennial question current bodies
like ela crusader etcetera planets are
nearly impossible to fight against
during daylight because the terrain
blows out the targeting info
so
yes um obviously we have the the ui team
would have their their party on this as
well but we constantly hear from them
and actually spend a good time today
talking about this issue with the ui
team um
it's not a trivial problem uh we
we have things that are you know
insanely bright in the game where you're
looking straight at the sun and there's
always subjective nature as whether that
should be blinding you know it is
incredibly bright or um
you know and it is a factor in real life
like but yeah there is many times when
it's not as legible as you'd want um so
what we've done on our side we've done
quite a few different shaded changes
which are
mostly done that type of in the process
have been brought into the ui pipeline
to be used in the game but these are
things like adding uh drop shadows
underneath text um we have uh ways like
you probably noticed when you use the
mobile glass it darkens the scene and
changes the exposure to give a better
chance of standing out we have
a new bloom and
uh
type of drop shadow background blur
effect that we can apply behind the ui
to kind of smudge out some of the
details and today we just got a request
to also clip out extra bright details
behind something so say if somebody's
got a
torch or there's some particular bright
light just behind in front of you then
you bring up mobile glass we'll type of
clip that type of extreme bright
highlight out
um but this is the type of
and then type of getting it into the
engine and getting into the actual
assets on the ui team so we've done
quite a lot of work there and
they're looking to try and uh integrate
some of that into the ui pipeline and
they come in
weeks months yeah and it's definitely
something actively talking about and
improving
yeah and uh folks may want to check out
uh it was just
uh it was just november or october it
was relatively recently uh we did one of
these qas with simon bersie the director
of ui and stuff and he asked this the
same question went to him and you can
see his answers uh it's not the kind of
thing that moves particularly faster
changes
to too much in in in three or four
months so the so the answers he gave you
there will probably still be uh
applicable today so you can check out
that star citizen live uh from just a
couple months ago
um
what graphical improvements
uh coming are you personally most
excited about
this probably won't be the answer
everyone wants but i just want i just
want frame rate frame rates king for me
tell it solid 60.
that's no good um so yeah for me it's a
frame rate uh once we have solid 60 uh
my interest will pick elsewhere um there
is somewhere as the engine visually that
i certainly want to see improve vastly
um but not before frame rate um that's
number one for me um i've had to pick a
second though just to pick someone's
interest maybe
uh our global illumination i'll have a
lighting system is is lacking that's
probably the the area that we are
furthest behind over engines everything
else is
on a power better than your average
competitor but the global illumination
system is is not where we wanted to be
so uh that would help the visuals and
really help the art teams as well so
that's what i'd like to see
then we'll leave you with this last
question
how do we get to 60 frames a second
what's the
what what what what's the mat what's the
magic bullet is there a magic bullet or
is it is it
50 other smaller things that all have to
happen in succession
uh to get us there
um
well
different answers for every single
person obviously different machines you
know some people might always be getting
north of 60fs all the time some people
will never hit 60fps
so
for me it's three things it's gen 12
first um once we finish gen12 which is
our cpu optimizations we shift our focus
to
gpu optimizations and the graphics
settings to give people control over how
their gpu has been used and then after
that
um the one part that i have no control
over is just the rest of the engine in
the game code which will which we talked
about earlier when we talked about cnfl
the particularly challenge area is a
game where we get a ton of players or
you know city and whatever else on
screen
uh or things like expo halls sometimes
should be challenging like this is where
we uh where
the other rest of the company will have
to take their or they are taking their
type of part of the problem on but yeah
for for our side it's definitely just
gen 12 and then after that immediately
after that we'll look at the gpu side of
it um to give you some more flexibility
there
networking i really want to see 60fps
after this um especially there will be
situations like i said would be more
uh troubling but difficult that the
i'm hoping a lot of the game
for most people you know that's the
target
in addition to graphic stuff it's
there's networking stuff there's the
there's the meshing there there there's
there's streaming there's just uh
optimizations in in
the actual assets themselves there
there's there's you know further lod
development it's it's it's everything
it's it's there is
if you take
if there's one answer you take away from
for this question folks
there is not one thing that will get us
where we're going and and that's that's
the truth for any game and on any
platform especially true for one as big
and as ambitious as ours it takes the
work of almost every team in every
aspect of star citizen to get us where
we're going and that includes to our
performance goals so so it will not be i
just i just want to disabuse anybody of
the notion that there will be a magic
day where we throw out a patch and it
will just be
and everything better you will you will
see just like with vulcan when we talked
about at the beginning of the show it
will be it will be implementation after
implementation after implementation
after implementation that gets us uh
where we're going and then uh like a uh
like getting used to cold or hot water
it'll just it's
it'll just we'll just suddenly be there
and it'll be where we need it to be so
so one thing on that we're going to add
is the um
something i spoke about as citizencon
and i've talked about on some of the
spectrum is that i would like to improve
some of our type of um
debug stats type of get for the backers
so they can kind of understand their
performance a little bit better um
because you know some points for cpu
bound uh
and a better cpu or more cores or faster
calls would be the what you need and at
some point it's cpu and i want to more
clearly display that to the users or the
ones that are interested in that so they
can better understand why their
framerate is what it is and whether
there is anything they can do and
especially obviously if they're gpu
bound it does become fully under my
control well i guess art as well
obviously they're producing the content
we're putting on the screen but um
ultimately like the graphics and
rendering um is under our controls when
it when your gpu bound the graphics
options we provide you uh and how our
technology works will be
you know that's all we need to get to 60
but if you're cpu bound then it's more
complicated picture um
yeah but we're hoping to like inform
people because there is a lot of
misinformation and confusion sometimes
about the performance of the game um
because it has changed so much and it
has been difficult in stages and
yeah i just want to clarify it for back
a second no nonsense this is this is
where your framework is at um hopefully
that will help people understand and
help them improve their framework as
well and see the improvements like as
they come so they can see their gpu time
reducing
uh or the cpu you know the cost of the
rendering side of the gpu side rendering
side of the cpu decreasing as we release
gen 12
you know even if they happen to be in
the xeno at that moment and still not
getting maybe quite the framework they
want
all right so that about wraps it up uh
ali thank you so much for taking the
time to be on the show uh this week uh
uh specifically again like i did the
beginning uh for for coming to us and
then asking to to do a show and asking
to speak to the backers and and share
your information we uh uh
if i'm allowed to speak on their behalf
i know that we all appreciate it um some
housekeeping stuff uh remember uh stars
uh or inside star citizen uh came out
yesterday with looks at with a look at
refueling coming in the upcoming alpha
317 as well as the hover quad
i have no idea when the hover quad
comes out
keep your eye on the
robertsspaceindustries.com i'm not
involved in that stuff so i don't know i
just make the videos um i do want to i
do want to add i saw some comments about
the christmas tree in in in in in tom's
uh background uh he filmed that back in
december that's how long a lead time
some of this stuff has so don't give him
too much crap for he doesn't still have
his christmas tree up i asked that was
filmed back in december so
go easy on him uh heck the refueling
thing was filmed in november so it's
that's that's how far the lead and how
those things go uh then uh uh next week
we've got an oops all sprint report
edition of inside star citizen we'll be
checking out all kinds of aspects of
star citizen development in next week's
ise and uh then we'll be right back here
on friday with another star citizen live
and i can't remember what it is or who's
on it right now so
i'm bad at my job uh also remember
xenothreat is ongoing now i believe it's
moving into phase two uh if it hasn't
already it will uh
soon so so check that out as well as the
this month in star citizen post on the
robertsspaceindustries.com website where
there's all kinds of activities uh
happening in the month of february
including uh quoramore and and
more
more and more
uh and then finally uh last thing uh i
have not moved to the uk yet i see some
people like why did he build the same
background uh no i am in a completely
virtualized background none of this is
real uh i'm actually still on vacation
at disney world uh you were you were you
were witnessing a simulacrum of disco uh
but uh we uh we uh
uh
i relocate to the uk uh in april after
this
current season of isc is done well we
move in the hiatus so
uh so yeah so it'll all look different
uh
come april uh who knows what it'll be
it'll probably be me standing in the
lobby of the new office with a bunch of
paint buckets and
ladders while they're still working on
it we'll see
so for star citizen live uh that's ally
brown director of graphics engineering
uh i'm
jared huckaby i'm in charge of the sheep
dip and we'll see you next week
everybody take care
you
