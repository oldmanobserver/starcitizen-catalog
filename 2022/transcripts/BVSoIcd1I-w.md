## Transcript

this is for the youtube let me redo the
intro hi everybody welcome to star
citizen live audio team q a
i'm disco and i'm doing this twice
because i forgot to start the recording
but the youtube people will never know
uh if you've never seen star citizen
live before it's where we take about an
hour out of the end of our week and we
hang out with some of our developers uh
this week uh for their first time in
2022 uh the members of the cig audio
team out of uh out of manchester how you
doing everybody
i don't usually have an even number of
people to fill the screen uh we we've
got jack
say hi jax
hello uh graham say hi grant
hello and uh brazzolo
you can't see it but his team's thing
never mind um
so
i'm not in my normal hour so i'm a bit
off
what are we doing today what are we
doing today
let's introduce the members of the team
and see what you do for the team let's
start with you graham
who are you and what do you do for star
citizen
i'm graham flipson and i'm the lead
audio programmer the star citizen and
squadron 42
what's a lead audio programmer do
um so mostly programming but also
telling other people what to program too
uh so they'll call the stuff that needs
to be programmed get programmed
at least that's how it's supposed to
work
hey you program that
list for me now no it's much more kind
of uh do you mind programming this for
me to get good facts
okay uh uh jack with the flickering
webcam which just started uh who are you
and what do you do for star citizen
hey yeah so i'm jack i'm a sound
designer on the project
and that is what i do
but for someone who doesn't know what a
sound designer does what what does a
sound designer do
yeah so we're responsible for so
offering the sounds themselves so that
could be designing weapon sounds or
spaceship sounds or anything like that
um so that's one half of the job and
then the other half of it would actually
be implementing the audio and getting it
to work in the game so it interacts
um live with the player input
so you're responsible for the way that a
a big gun goes
exactly yes okay
uh uh uh bob who are you and what do you
do for star citizen i get a recording of
that
oh you're not you're not gonna be able
you're not dude once once we're in the
same office you're not gonna be able to
stop me i'm gonna be in there
like i still want to do this i still
want to do the april fool's artisanal
sounds thing where it just replaces all
the sounds of the weapons and the ships
and everything with just my voice
yeah what do you do for something bob oh
sorry okay i'm bob solo uh i'm dialogue
lead and um dialogue lead well that's uh
yeah just work with all the dialogues
all the character audio all the uh
background audio uh for dialogue um that
makes the full dialogue landscape we um
you know go record them
make them sound nice and and as jack
mentioned about implementation getting
it to work well in the game
can you tell me where my voice sounds
like this
yeah
that's a nice reverb you got there
i wasn't sure if you were going to hear
it over the over the stream it actually
worked that was good
all right so uh
for this hour we're doing an open-ended
q a with members of of the audio team
remember that uh the audio team is much
bigger than just the three you see here
so so if the particular member of the
team that has the particular answer for
your particular question uh isn't here
uh we may not be able to you know answer
every single query but we got a nice
little
diverse group of designers and
programmer and whatever the heck bob
does
so
so we're going to jump right in you can
submit your questions in the twitch chat
now by posting your question with the
word question in capital letters
surrounded by brackets and then uh while
that's those questions are coming in we
will go to our thread that we put up
earlier this week that allowed people to
submit their questions and then a vote
on which ones they wanted to see at it
most um right off the bat we're going to
start with uh the last time that we
really saw the audio team was at digital
citizencon last year where we introduced
claudius this brand new tool that's
going to
reshape the way that i mean frankly
everything everything is made for star
citizen as far as audio wise um how's
that been coming along in the last
almost year since we saw it
um yes i'll take that since it's uh
my baby's guess um so we've been
progressing steadily uh what we showed
back at citizencon was a tech demo and
as you know sort of tech demos are
knockoff we're sort of fully rounded
finished features
so what we were showing was some of the
design decisions we've made about how
claudius was going to work and
we demonstrated a little bit of that
but one of the big decisions that we
made behind claudius was that every
single audio feature becomes systemic
and that's a huge undertaking it means
that we've got to go through every
single game system that exists right
down from the tiny little things like
the
jukebox all the way up to capital ships
and everything in between every single
feature and we have to implement those
features in the tool in claudius and in
the underlying sig audio engine
that allows us to make all of those
features available to designers
uh where they choose to put them so it's
a really big sort of uh undertaking
we're making really good progress on it
and we're hopeful um it's only going to
be a few more months before we can
actually release something with claudius
acted
inside the build um
that won't be where claudius is actually
driving the whole audio of the game
because that's the sort of the longer
term goal is to replace every system but
things are progressing really well we've
got some really great features coming in
um i do hope that we can talk about it
again
another video maybe so yeah you know a
few months time or something i'm not
sure when it will be but yeah we've got
uh we got a lot of really good plans for
it and we want it to be um
a real sort of revelation for designers
when it comes out so we're not releasing
it until it's ready to be used so that's
the big thing that's it's still kind
it's not under wraps as such but it's
just uh it's still germany
and and uh uh
backers and watchers of the show are
used to hearing the word release apply
to things to the moment when they get
their hands on it you're of course
talking about a release internally to
when folks like jack you know over here
get to get to use it and
like many of our uh uh
procedural or systemic tools you know
it's not designed to
take the work away from the designers
and do the work for them but just
provide them more tools and more
capabilities uh in order to be more
efficient
and more
successful in the creation of of their
content
yeah yeah i did it really certainly
sorry no i was just going to say just
really quickly to kind of chime in it's
really about letting the creatives be
creative i mean what what happens when
you don't have a great tool set or a
tool set that that that's uh you know
quite aged it it uh it's
there's a lot of extra work that has to
go into getting what you want out of it
and it's it's a lot of time sync it's
it's just a lot of faff and so you know
the sound designers they have to spend a
lot of time in that world when
you know they it's it would be much
better for them to be doing more
creative work and so that's that's
really the whole
meaning behind this is just to get the
creatives to do more creative work and
that's that's that's the big key yeah
the way i put it is it's uh the whole
design is workflow first so we look at a
good workflow and then we
build all the infrastructure behind it
that allows it to happen
uh as members of the audio team
commander deckard would like to know
when will server meshing be done
that's an interesting uh question to ask
the audience
uh
uh here's one that comes i i i'm pretty
sure we have to go back to the tape but
i'm pretty sure this question has come
up every single time you guys have been
on scl will we get
sonic booms
that's a slightly different question to
what we've been asked in honest i think
people quite often ask the question
about speed of sound and we talk about
why it's not something that uh mostly
for gameplay reasons for uh player
response times and things like this we
choose not to
implement it and it's really a
game-playing decision um but sonic boom
specifically i mean there's no reason
why we couldn't do that we could uh we
can allow sonic booms we can play them
with the correct sort of
speeds and depending on atmospheric
pressure and things like this and so
yeah we could absolutely implement that
but what we would probably not do with
it is respects the speed of sound
distance from the sonic boom to the
listening device
yeah
and why not
again mostly because
we need to make the same decision across
the whole game so that everything knits
together nicely and for gameplay reasons
that decision is not to have speed of
sound delays
i'm not ruling it out entirely
it's not impossible to
to implement but it is much more of a
gameplay decision because it affects so
many aspects of young play yeah
it's worth remembering that there are
many many many
many aspects of star citizen but there
are not all
uh
it's it's you know some things that are
that are in some games are made possible
because those games specialize in
certain you know specific aspects of the
sci-fi or the space going experience and
what on star citizen aims to create a a
sandbox uh that as many people with as
many different desires and drives and
attitudes can play in at once so the
i'll put our features set up against
anybody's but at the same time
there won't be every single little thing
that you see in every other game
uh
oh here's
here here here's some fire here here's
some
here here's some uh
here's some feedback uh when in combat
it feels like there's a lack of sound or
direction of where the shots are hit and
the direction they come from and how it
affects my ship
are there planned improvements to the
immersion of sound effects to better
help combat situations
i can answer this yeah
oh great you got it
that's cool you go jack
had any additional info at the end
yeah i was just going to say um so it's
definitely something we want to look
into um for sure um it's probably
something that um when propagation comes
online but um it's likely to become
easier at that point um but yeah that's
still tech graham's working on so
probably take over from there
it is an interesting question actually
because although the propagation tech
will uh improve understanding of
direction in some situations it can also
make it more difficult in others because
if you're in ship combat and you're in
uh first person so your view is within
the ship a lot of what you might hear
maybe resonance from the outside of the
ship which is a little bit less easy to
log in um so maybe we need to be
offering options there uh when it's all
stuff that we look into once we have a
fully working propagation system but i
would expect that kind of
that sound to propagate
partially directly but also um there'll
be a lot of diffusion around it as well
and we've been talking about the audio
propagation for
uh for some time now
and uh
obviously you mentioned it it can often
it will get affected by things like
atmosphere and pressure and stuff like
that the next question
says are there any plans for players to
immediately hear when they are entering
a room the difference between vacuum or
atmosphere due to how the sounds are
propagated through the suit
yeah
so there are a few aspects that are
necessary to uh
be completed aspects of the tech that
need to be complete before that can
actually happen
right now the audio system fully
supports the pressure within any space
and if the space is depressurizing that
information is passed on to the audio
system and it's available to
sound designers to express that through
their sounds and we do do that um you
can
uh in certain circumstances depressurize
some of our ships and you can be sort of
firing a weapon inside it and you can
hear the difference as it depressurizes
but
that system isn't fully operational
there's a lot of work that needs to be
done on the room system
to allow true sort of transfer pressure
and balance of pressurization across
multiple rooms and atmospheres planetary
atmosphere and all these kinds of things
so that's work that i'm involved in in
in conjunction with
other things and
we are progressing so yes the short
answer is yes i could have just said yes
and
we do plan to support that
yeah there's no way we fill up the hour
if you just say yes
uh
oh here's another old favorite uh any
plans to support surround sound five one
seven one dolby at most as far as i can
tell star citizen currently uses up mix
stereo leaving the center channel of a
5-1 setup mostly silent and the surround
speakers mirror the front speakers which
makes the soundscape just stereo instead
of actual surround
yeah
what the hell this was an interesting
question because
i guess for the to a large extent we've
all been working from home on headphones
and uh
everything sounds as it should right
because we've got a left and a right and
that's all you need because you've only
got two ears
if you're on that side of the argument
which we're not obviously so um
surround is fully supported by both our
engine and um the wise engine that we
use the middleware that we use
um and
i think
we will have to investigate why this
user is experiencing what they're
experiencing because we do probably
support 5.1 or 7.1 as output mods in
wise and it may just be there's some
sort of setup issue there
but it's definitely something that's not
so easy for us to check when we're
mostly at home on headphones so um yeah
we can we can we will dig into that one
because uh it came a little surprised to
hear that question
there are a couple of folks in the live
chat who are confirming it's their
experience as well so
that is very good to know and we will um
treat that one as critical
uh
be exciting to get back into your
your your your new audio spaces in the
new uh in the new offices yeah the new
building i was actually going to kind of
touch on that too i mean that's
even the space that i'm here in in
freedom house i mean these the room here
is
too small for a 5.1 um and most of our
spaces here are we do have the you know
apollo and we're able to do 5.1 in there
um but as as graham says still a lot of
us are still you know working from home
so but the new office you know each of
our
pods will be 5.1 and the the the new mix
space there is going to be a flagship
7.1 uh uh you know um at most still the
at most and it's going to be a fantastic
room to do to do proper mixing in and to
you know i mean part of the thing too is
authoring content in the 5.1 i mean we
don't have the tools at the moment to to
really author that content as well in
that kind of sense so it's
there's a lot of it that's just really
for for us as designers to to get in
there and be able to have proper spaces
and proper tools to to really make that
5.1 experience shine and and as graham
also said debugging and testing you know
so
[Music]
all right uh let's see here's another
old chestnut in-game radio
that's all it says in-game radio
question
question mark
uh currently that'd be super cool i mean
are we talking
like real songs from now or made up
songs from the future
yeah
this question comes up uh uh quite
frequently uh there are a number of ways
to to do this kind of thing you know
whether whether it's you know the gta
style where we license a bunch of music
and curate it you know on on rate on
individual radio stations just let
people tune in uh and play to that uh
whether we contract out with folks and
create an entirely original selection of
30th century
rock songs or whatnot to the thing or
what a lot of people tend to ask is the
ability to broadcast their own
radio and then that ends up you know
opening up a whole another can of worms
uh with with uh between legal and
content rights i'm sure most people who
are watching on twitch right now are no
stranger
to the to the twitch uh situation with
the riaa and playing music if i mean if
you had an in-game radio station that
you could run the whole purpose of it
was that you would want other people to
hear it so if you could if you were
playing star citizen and then you turned
a corner and then you heard somebody
else's radio station playing a song that
the riaa is currently looking out for on
twitch and you were streaming at the
time you get your channel banned because
you know this person over here was was
streaming there are lots of lots of
considerations for that kind of stuff
it's not a hard no it's not a hard no
the the situation's always changing
and evolving and stuff like that and
there's there's
all manner of new tech solutions that
that come we we do have we do have uh
old backers will remember the jukebox in
the in the player hangers uh that lets
you play your own mp3s in the hangar and
it radiated through their own personal
hanger and stuff so so it's not to say
that there's not some middle ground to
uh to be found i can at least say that
from from narrative's point of view from
from dave haddock he is definitely been
out there interested in in uh you know
having lord having actual you know
musicians and music in fiction in in
star citizen so we do we do expect to
have you know that music in in there
whether we'll have enough or how long
would it take to get enough to kind of
warrant a full-on in-fiction radio
station
we'll see right but but at least you
know there will be expectations of
having more in fiction music so uh and
and artists and and that are actually
part of the universe rather than just us
composing what we think 30th century uh
music would be
as we all know in the future music is
all generated by ai anyway so um i think
we just need to you know we just create
some ai we just generate hundreds of
hours of
the world's greatest dj in the 30th
century is dj dali
and he's he's moved from image
generation to just straight music
generation based on a string a sentence
string and it is terrible
you're much enormous
it is terrible um
but i uh
it it just just uh in case the answer
sounds like a like a no and folks get uh
you know disheartened i will say that
this comes up internally
so often like like bob just said
speaking on behalf of dave haddock and
stuff uh
i have to imagine based on how long i've
been here and the people that i work
with that something will happen at some
point like it's just another diegetic a
ver a very immersion immersion-building
aspect of this universe we're trying to
build so i can't tell you what form or
shape it's going to end up
in ultimately but there's too many
people here who want something for
something never to
materialize
yeah i really hope to get the
opportunity to record some 30th century
space rock as well we'll just play that
uh we'll play that big benny's uh uh uh
song that roster ginza and i made just
on loop over and over and over again
um which you can hear on our youtube
channel if you dig far enough
uh
okay is there a limit
on how far we can hear sound effects
distant gunfire and ship sounds are one
of the most awesome things
two of the most awesome things
uh yeah so we tried scale sounds sort of
based on real life values um so now
every sound in the game will have an
attenuation on it which determines the
uh distance the total distance the sound
can travel then the further away you get
from the source um it will start
tailored taking off from volume and um
filter down as well um so yeah we're
already doing that in the game
yeah i think the suggestion in the
question might be that they want to hear
more of the distant stuff and i think we
have some uh plans in the tech involved
in sig audio and claudius that will
allow us to be more responsive to
situational differences and you know
based on the context of the game we
might be more distant space battles if
there isn't
a close by space battle going on at the
same time i think so um yeah it's all
part of that design so
give us uh plenty of time and some time
we can make improvements in that area as
well
in some cases too it is actually a bit
of a different content too we have to
you know have different content for
those different contextual switches in
some cases to really get it to shine
properly and mix right and and all those
things so it's it's not just as simple
as taking a gun sound and just that gun
sound being that far away you know it
could be
uh as graham said you know having that
claudius will really help us uh with
crowding and distancing and doing things
in a much more efficient manner as well
um
here's another question i think the
answer is going to have to touch on some
of that in-game radio stuff will we have
a pa-like system
in our ships
that actually i remember that question
last year uh that is definitely
something i personally feel pretty
passionate about yes yes there will be
yes
and we've actually made progress on that
tech so we last last time we spoke about
it we were starting to get it to the
point where we had um some of these
dynamic events with these mission-driven
pas uh being broadcasted into multiple
locations and off off of speaker arrays
and things like that and that was uh i
was taking kind of the fundamental
basics of how this would work having a
source being broadcasted across uh two
to multiple receivers and uh since then
with this last uh you know what's his
last fleet week and uh siege horse and
uh we've uh we've uh uh pushed that
further and did some more robust work
with it you know i mean there's still
next steps after that would be to have a
bit more finer detail on the types of pa
and the speaker arrays and and so we can
have better detail between like a
hallway pa versus a broom versus like
the the
bigger hangers and things like that you
know uh and and then next after that is
to take it to
to an actual ship you know we've been
doing these mostly in locations and
whatnot so now we need to
take a ship as an example as a prototype
and do it there um what would probably
be the source would be the ship computer
so we'll look at like warnings and crits
that would you would want to
send to the whole ship for for example
right now when you get a ship computer
response it's like warning crit like
your ship's gonna explode that's only
going to the pilot the pilot operating
seat so we would like for that to
actually like like this is suggesting
how the pa broadcast the ship
uh and tell the whole ship that you know
you're about to blow up uh but uh uh you
know that's that's gonna take that
prototyping and then you know as you can
probably imagine taking that one markup
for that one ship and
putting it across our whole fleet of
ships that's gonna be quite an
undertaking you'd like to do that the
most efficient way as well
um but one step further
is to take it so it's not just a you
know the ship computer or any kind of
system voice doing that is that to give
the player interaction to actually speak
into this pa in in a targeted room like
for example they they've just rescued
some guy and he's in their their cargo
bay you can actually you know say i'm
talking directly to cargo bay say hey
welcome welcome to my ship you know blah
blah and have it come out this pa
speakers and and uh um that person like
oh cool thanks you know uh and what not
so you know it's uh that kind of level
of detail is really what we're after and
as you can see it's gonna take a few
iterations of tech and steps to get
there but uh
we're on our way and we've been making
progress
and and you're pretty clear all you can
pretty clear on that all the way up
until you get to the parts where players
can speak over it at that point you run
into the same considerations in-game
radio has now in your rarely broadcast
you know server wide or whatever but
this is still the ability to
sing
and change your virtual microphone to an
mp3 out
and and
blast music over your spaceship and
stuff so
so it's it's it's just one of those
things like i want to say it's it's
you've got
for folks who want it you have a
tremendous champion and brazillo here
and yeah
well we'll have to see if
it if it's something to be kind of more
client or if it's that a person in your
group or something and not like to the
uh to the full-on server but yeah you're
right though
that open mic can be received at this
time i mean it happens to some extent in
voice over ip2
i was just going to say i mean
it's taking that already existing
voiceover ip and making it yeah kind of
in game in world so i i would hope that
still works out yeah well when it's loud
enough for other people to hear it
anyway
what's the deal with that
is that sorry i said what's the deal
with that
mr question half the time i see voice
over ip it's so low other people can't
hear it like we need more volume control
yes so we um we actually made some uh
some progress on this quite some time
ago and um what we need is
a new menu to be created where a player
can go in and speak into their mic and
they can monitor their level and then
they can set their transmission level
and the audio tech for this exists we
just need to work with other teams to
get it
working in the ui and in the the menu
and uh we should be able to make
improvements in that area um there is no
reason beyond that why anyone should be
any quieter than anyone else because uh
they're all being through the same setup
obviously you have attenuations so if
you if you're not in a
chat channel a voice channel with
somebody then you're going to just hear
them naturally and you have to be very
close to them to hear that because
it becomes on us very quickly if we if
we have to go up on that kind of thing
and we have had those problems a few
people communicating over voip and uh
having you know uh bachmann turner
overdrive plastic out in the background
and that's all anyone can hear when you
walk past that person so yeah it's all
about ruins really
central park and fall
uh while we're talking the voice
communications uh any chance we get
filters or uh new variables uh
what ways to alter or
or otherwise yeah
yeah i mean we already do it essentially
in uh in from the npc's standpoint i
mean if you go to like uh was it the was
it lauraville or uh anywhere you have
the security guards where they have mask
on and you can hear them through the
mask little darth vadery kind of sounds
i mean that that's essentially
a a disguise filter that i've put on
their voice as a runtime effect so it's
not something i've baked in there they
if they if they were to uh remove their
masks they would you would hear them
speak their normal voice
so um
uh you know it is something that that is
already done but again it's it's one of
those things where we have the tech it's
working now we need to have that player
interaction and that player choice and
be able to put it on the voiceover ip so
that we can have them use it and and and
do that as well so it's just
moving that bar and extending it to uh
to players
you know it is definitely something i
would like to do and also look into
you know offering a lot obviously more
more uh um uh variations and allowing
people to kind of almost you know do
work you know
giving them enough play with it that so
that they can kind of design and play
and make their own disguise
you know
yeah tech wise i think you know this is
uh i'll keep talking about sigordi and
claudius but the whole design of this is
that we allow um
the
basically the design of audio but it's
getting to become more of a playground
more of a
place where a designer can play around
and make interesting things and there's
absolutely no reason why um voice
effects could be you know couldn't be
one of these things that is uh offered
by the the new audio engine once it
comes online
so yeah maybe one day we'll have lots of
people wandering around
uh and while we're on voice chat um
in-game voice has several bugs that have
persisted for years after a while of
playing individual single directed links
drop out so if a b and c are in a party
a stops hearing b but b can still hear a
c can hear everybody and it's
progressive so more and more links drop
out as time goes by and sometimes a
player gets extremely low volume for no
reason even when talking over radio uh
anything you can
anything you can you you can any hope
you can you can give the the
there's always hope um to fix all these
things you need all you need are time
and resources and determination and uh
we've certainly got the last one of
those three um but the big issue with
with voip is the amount of testing time
the amount of repro time it takes and
you know we've we've spent days uh
attempting to reproduce these issues and
either have no success or you know just
have they just kind of work or you know
we've always not been able to track down
what is causing these issues we do
continue to look into it and it is
always on our plan to improve because um
we want it to be 100 reliable system
that people feel like they can go to
not need to fall back to
other third-party chat applications and
things like that so yes absolutely we we
do continue to look into it and we've
made over the last year we've made some
huge stability improvements
from what people are saying it's not
quite there yet but that's the problem
is you know we fix the big issues and
then you get to the smaller ones and the
smaller ones and
you get
the deeper you go the longer it takes to
get to the point where you can figure
out what's happening before you can fix
it and the thing about the voip system
and then fight as a whole
is it's a hugely complex infrastructure
that goes way beyond just um recording
some voicing game and passing it down to
the game server and then propagating it
to the players it's like we have
completely separate voice servers that
uh
they don't even rely on you being on the
same game server so when server message
comes online and your friends on a
completely different server when they're
transitioning between servers this this
is all infrastructure we've built that
allows that to be seen so you can you
can still communicate when you're
transitioning between different servers
so um
we have all this complexity that was
very forward thinking and you know some
of this complexity is some is part of
the reason why some of these bugs exist
but it's the right thing to do because
long term we also know with a system
that satisfies our future needs as well
as our present ones
as don steeler gaming says
certainly
sounds like a tough problem
nice
don't blame me blame dawn's dealer in
chat
uh bob
what are the plans to have more npc
background chatter or general hubbub in
populated areas
oh yes yes yes yes so the last couple uh
locations have really i think we've done
a a much better job i think i mean we
started out the first test cases of
really improving this was the cargo and
refinery decks which were location uh uh
generic and uh they um
uh it really had a great positive uh uh
you know
addition to it right i mean i hope we
knew that but it was uh um i was really
kind of trying to dissect and adding you
know we had you know
the dialogue landscape has a foreground
and you know actual ai interacting you
know words coming out of the ai's mouth
and that but then you have you know
sight unseen this middle ground that the
chatter that they're kind of referring
to that uh that we've really been
focusing on it doesn't have a it doesn't
have any other stimuli other than that
you're in a populated space and you want
it to have that uh uh immersion and that
that feeling that there's life there
when maybe there's not really anything
actually triggering it and that was a
big thing that we did with these spaces
um the one last thing is is the the base
the very background um walla which is
that indiscernible it's almost like a
sound effect of
of dialogue just kind of filling the
space and we've we've added the you know
uh uh layers of that but it's still this
static-y type thing that that's just for
that these spaces and and uh we did this
i think really well with uh orizon where
he went and picked out these densely
populated areas that we knew that would
pretty much usually have that type of
population and it were able to add those
chatters
um so you had the dialogue even if the
even if the ai wasn't there really you
know actually acting and
vocalizing and and we had the the the
walla in the background so it's these
layers kind of compounding together that
gives you a dialogue landscape and a
feeling of life
but it's all still you know very uh us
attacking these spaces and and whatnot
right um and we're actually we've taken
this and orzon being a very good um
a full prototype of of doing that for a
whole location we're now going back to
like lauraville and some of these other
locations and really trying to uh fill
them out as well so so we we've taken
this in in in our now are kind of um
generating more and more and it's it's
really helping we've hit the hospitals
with some some vignetti type chatter we
want to do the the uh um
the the habs as well uh especially
they're gonna find some cool stuff you'd
like walking through the halls and
hearing some weird stuff especially the
more fun locations like grimace and get
some cool stuff in there
and pyro is going to be fun too coming
up with a lot of that kind of outlaw uh
stuff that's actually where we're hoping
to get a lot of the dialogue life uh out
of there because we
we won't have as much character content
for such a new location right so it's
going to be really
uh the that middle ground and that um
of background will really help help with
those spaces but our future we would
really like to have more of these like a
dynamic wallace system that can not not
just you know say that this is a space
that has population and so we should
treat it as such but to to actually look
at the populations and dynamically look
because it's not just an npc's roaming
around it's players and we want to you
know make sure that that if if you stand
in a room with a bunch of players that
that actually also feels like a densely
populated space and you don't know when
that's going to happen it's going to be
very dynamic and whatnot and it's going
to have a mood it's going to have a uh
you know again the population and all
those things so we want to in a you know
a
dynamic of of the types of
populations in there right so it's it's
it and we'll take stems and we'll take a
a a lot of source of wallet and mix it
appropriately to
have you feel like that's the space that
you're in and
and that's going to take a lot of
content it's going to take a lot of tech
and a lot of prototyping a lot of work
on it but we we have
almost
started the process we're getting there
we have we have some big to be honest we
have some big choices to make with the
type of software that we want to use
because part of part of the big thing
that we want to do with
creating so many assets is using uh uh
texas speech and speech to speech and
using these kind of tools to help
bolster what recordings we already have
and things like that and really to help
us
generate the right amount of content
without having to go and record record
and record and record uh a bunch of
wallace sessions so so it's it's uh um
we're looking at that tech right now and
we have we need to make and it's quite a
you know pretty substantial a decision
to
for for monetary to to make that kind of
decision so we need to do our homework
we need to do our research we need to
compare and weigh against and and all
those things so we're at that level at
the moment where we're about to engage
with some good research and then once we
pick that then we can really start to
move on with uh with getting a proper
wallace system in there
um and
one
and whatnot so that's that's why i kind
of flowered on there but um as a
follow-up to that uh when you're talking
about investigating softwares and
text-to-speech and stuff uh shaney in
the live chat asked uh have you been
looking at a.i generated voices for like
third-tier nbc's like the atc uh
google's latest ai voice tech sounds
amazing this person said
yes i mean
that that is definitely a very good
point we we can do that for for npcs i
mean mostly our our target has been
really for like the system voices uh uh
you know like for i know there's a
question down here and on ship computer
voices so i don't make it safer for that
but but uh you know a lot of system
voices that are especially having a lot
of incremental game design and so it's
like we can't you know it's when we want
to go record and cast and you know an
actor and get them in it's we have a you
know amount of amount of you know lines
for them everything with the monetary
and make it make sense go in there get
get a much
enough amount of content and then but
you know some at some point later you'll
want to have this
new gameplay feature and in that that
thing only has five lines and you're
like okay well you know i need to call
this actor up to have them come back in
and record five lines or or if it's uh
you know work from home kind of studio
whatever it is it's still that's that's
they have you know basic minimum fees
for sessions and it's just not
financially viable so
so we we especially just even for our
iterative game devil might want to look
at these ai uh creating voices and
whatnot but we also would like to be
able to still pick and choose our talent
pick and choose the people we want to
have in our game and so we we're looking
at ways to be able to create our own
voice packs and and say
actor
so-and-so person you're going to be the
voice of this ship and we're gonna go
capture your essence and be able to
create a voice from you that we can then
drive with our our text of speech or
speech to speech is another thing that
we've been looking into too where you uh
someone can actually uh um you know take
we can take a voice actor and
and you know a staff or or anybody else
can can read off those lines in the way
we like but it'll sound like that that
person that we captured um and it's
another way to to bolster content
without having to to to
you know
hire talent for just five lines apiece
but we you know obviously we still pay
them these proper you know buyouts and
proper licenses for their for their uh
you know their voice it's not you know
we we do make sure that the talent are
treated well and that we we we do the
all the right legal things with that and
it it it has been adapting in the
industry i mean we're not the only ones
to kind of consider that right the film
film is also looking at ways to to do
better adr so you don't you know you can
you have a project to film and you know
there's there's requirements to say you
can only adr 10 with these speech to
speech things and and then you know
you're able to uh bolster it without
having the the guy have to come in for
five lines or something you know uh and
and and that's that's that's benefit but
we we obviously are are very keen on
that and you know and we want to we want
to push forward with these these uh um
these ai or these you know these uh uh
speech or text speech creating voices
and and
really you know
have a lot more content to work with
there are there are technical issues
that need to be overcome though because
i know um some of these ai generated uh
speech samples do sound amazing but a
lot of that
ai is trained on natural language and
it's trained on a known language and a
lot of our language in law isn't known
and
is a little bit tricky for some of these
things and it's really important we make
sure we don't end up in any valley
because i think when these ai
generations get something wrong
you can really hear that it's uh it's
not a person speaking so yeah it's a lot
of research
uh
last question from the chat for a bit
we'll go back to the thread uh
are you guys bringing tessa banister
back
i love tessa banister uh you know the
the uh the actor um that our actress
actor actress uh that that plays that
role she she's she's phenomenal she's
she's really sweet and and it was it was
great to get her back in last time we
had her and i i'm i'm sure we'll we'll
have her and again i i can only imagine
that she's being such a fan favorite and
and a staff favorite we love working
with her so
i would sure hope so
you're not going to be able to hear this
my system's stuck processing an unknown
reading
i'd love to be able to provide more
information on my report than just like
five question marks in a row
i think you could take a look at what's
at this location
i'd love to be able to provide more
information on my report than just like
five question marks in a row
then you could take a look at what's in
this location
my system's stuck processing an unknown
reading my god okay she kept going all
right
um
all right let's get back we got about 15
minutes left
uh let's get let's let's do some
so some rapid fire stuff here as we get
through as many of these as possible
um are there plans to make components
sound off when they're having issues
performing correctly to help engineers
identify non-critically damaged or
faulty components quicker
yes it's something we definitely want to
look into it should be fairly simple in
practice um we'll just need to assign a
sound to each component and then tie
that into a value to say how much i have
health it has
um so it's like what graham said earlier
it's just a case of time and resources
but yeah something we absolutely like to
do
uh let's see uh
since audio in the void is computer
interpreted uh
if if if if we emp an area will the
sound in spacesuits in that area stop
getting sound from the outside
that's the question for gameplay and
gameplay design but uh we will offer the
tech from the audio team
to allow that if the game design wants
it i would like it
i'd love it i'd love it i'd love to be
able to just hear the sounds from within
the suit if everything you know if the
suit is dead
uh as a as a follow-up to that besides
an emp potentially disabling it any
consideration or discussion about simply
turning off the audio simulation uh
willingly so that people can play in
eerie
spooky
hard mode
um yeah i think that'd be amazing thing
to do as well and i think maybe we can
offer against gameplay question but
there could be some penalty for having
your um audio simulation switched on it
could be you may light up somebody's
radar if you if you have this thing
switched on so if you want to be
stealthy you go accept no sounds or
something like that i think that'd be
really cool
uh
how come several soundscapes are gone
area 18 tram for example it used to beep
and buzz
and sounds like a bug so something we'll
look into
yeah
thanks for letting us know
okay
it's it's kind of key to note that that
uh uh you know certain overarching
implementations of systems and things
like that do change over time and and
quite often what happens is they they
might
something else might happen inexplicably
and it will go unnoticed because it was
working before uh and and it's always
hard to kind of catch those things and
gave the melon it really is it takes it
you know that's that's that's really
honestly why we have like you know
qa and and and you know uh fans you know
or you know community sharing these type
of things happening because it really
helps us catch those kind of things when
when when uh when it's
we've done it and it worked and
how do we know when it breaks
it's also why we've got quite a big push
going on internally for automatic
testing so one of the things we're
aiming for is uh knowing what the
response to this particular gameplay
situation should be from the audio
system and confirming that is still the
case wrong build to build
but we're nowhere near um ready with
that yet so even one day we'll have a
system that can pick these things up
before they go out when one system is
developed one system and another system
were developed in two separate branches
and then they get together for the first
time in game dev
that's where bugs are born
that's why i don't have children
that i know of um why are shutdown
sounds for your ship so different from
engine sounds it's not connected to the
engine sound at all but a completely
different sound effect
um once again a risk of echoing um or
repeating what i've already said it's
sort of a time and resources thing um
just due to the amount of ships we're
working on and we sort of have a system
set up already but
works um but yeah i'm looking into tying
up the
startup and shutdown sounds um to the
engine something we need to look into it
will take a lot of time um so you have
something hopefully for the future
i think another thing is you know some
of the tech we're working on is going to
make it easier for you guys to
hook into
the state of the ship at the point where
it shuts down so
yeah uh we've mentioned propagation a
few times uh does that mean the doors
and such will block sound
yes absolutely so the propagation system
has been uh long in development and
that's because of the amount of rework
and the bug that's had to go on to to
support it fully reworking the room
system and uh creating mapping for that
room system and things like this and
it's in progress now i have working
demos and um
it's
one of the main things that it does from
an audio perspective is respect when
doors are opened and closed it also
respects um
angular angles of travel of sounds so
you can kind of know and you can affect
the way a sound sounds because of how
many times you have to turn around the
corner to get to your ears and you know
we can kind of express a lot more about
where the sounds are propagating grom
and to
and conveyor through this system
so yeah doors absolutely explode
jared show the working demos of what
what are you talking about
i have working demos and i haven't shown
anyone
i'm like i don't i don't have any
working demos
we've had the same
ship computer voices
for variety for the various
manufacturers
for like
28 years now
that might be embellishing for my own
personal
uh exhaustion are there plans to rec to
re-record new lines for the ships to
better fit the current and future
mechanics star citizen is moving towards
please do god say yes
yes
yes now i kind of briefly touched on it
with that other question talking about
the uh the ai and having a um
texas speech generating the voices and
whatnot and that and that's a big
proponent in this in this redesign we we
have it on the plate to completely
overhaul and completely redesign the
ship computer voices and it really
starts with that tech and getting buying
into that tech and figuring out which
one we're going to use
from there we we not only do i mean
though not only are we trying to improve
the content that we're using but we also
want to improve its role in in in
everything and one of the things that's
really important to us is
unifying the warning and crit package
uh across all manufacturers and the the
the the
the dialogue that's used there the um
the visual representation the sound
effects representation all those three
things kind of come together to really
put together a complete experience for
for how you would experience a warning
in a crit and how they should operate
and how how you would expect them to to
function and in a lot of it we really
want to look toward you know
the military and actual jet fighter jets
and how how they you know there's a lot
of science that goes into these kind of
award warnings and alerts and and we
would like to you know treat it a bit
more uh real world with that and get to
get into involved in it with a bit more
i mean still really cool but but uh uh
you know we that is a huge
you know a passion project for us to to
really achieve a much better ship
computer in that kind of sense and that
and that's just one role you know
definitely fixing and unifying that
specific experience but you know we
would like to look at the
you know um having a better uh a ship
computer that that uh uh acknowledges
the essence of the manufacturer or the
luxury or the the military or the uh the
uh utilitarian you know we we want to
have uh uh you know it have that heart
um and to really share that a bit better
um but also one one extra thing too is i
i personally would like to have
some more ship computer
roles relating to gameplay loops you
know i feel like especially it'd be
great to have uh um
a ship computer based for exploration
that that can really kind of touch on on
the the systems and give you more
information and and thoughts and the
dangers and lurkings and all these
things about about your exploration or
maybe a ship computer voice that's more
detailed to combat to give you a an idea
like oh you know a danger will robinson
like that's that you're gonna you're
heading into a dangerous uh a system uh
or you're you're outnumbered uh there's
a lot of ships that approaching and it's
to a point where you know we sense that
you're you're not going to be able to
to to to succeed give the player a
talent but but just you know that these
these ideas are are in our heads the
they we were really trying to put them
down to paper and uh it's really
obviously like i said it really takes
getting the bright tech first um but all
these things are on the table um and uh
none of them have been fully signed off
yet but it's really
what we're seeing
we're clearly seeing is that the ship
computer
currently does not fulfill the role that
we would like to see it and so very much
we will be uh addressing this um as we
sort out that deck
i've always wanted there to be optional
you know swap outs and stuff too like
some that are more expensive than others
and some that are really cheap like we
missed our opportunity to get gilbert
gottfried as like the
as like the entry-level drake like drank
combat assist turned on
major torque and balance what does this
mean
i don't know what this means it's on the
screen
there's enough recordings of him jared
to resurrect him believe me well they
got apparently alexa can do that now so
uh you can program like set over to
speak in the voice of a dead loved one
now so oh my goodness
never mind we're
we're going we're going to black mirror
stuff now
and yes
and yes that was a terrible gilbert
godfrey impersonation
i've never attempted one in my life
before
and i sh i wish that had still been the
case
in this moment
um voice control
i i i know this is another one that
you're big on i'm going to turn this
into the rizzola show voice control
things like voice attack but you know in
game it integrated
our own kind of thing what are your
thoughts oh oh for sure for sure i mean
i actually i do correct me if i'm wrong
i can't remember this was like quite a
few years ago but i thought there
actually already exists a couple
third-party systems that third party
yeah yeah you can do do for uh do for
our shift so obviously that the tech is
there um it's just doing that tech
internally for ourselves that's that's
another
a big undertaking uh but i would like to
go one step further i mean one one of
the big things that i really would like
to see with uh with voice is that that
your voice um you know uh interacts with
the npcs like you know not only your
ship and whatnot but if you're on the
ground and you're walking through a
location you can walk up to an npc and
say hi and then they will say hi back to
you because you registered that you
greeted them and that you they can reach
you back or simply just being able to
you know you have the inner voice you
know uh responses and instead of going
there and having to click on one you can
just say one of the responses and the
npc will acknowledge that how cool would
that be that that's like my passion i
would like for something like that at
some at some point but uh it is a quite
a big undertaking for the tech that we
would need in there and um as you can
see uh graham has quite a few uh uh
big things on his plate already with
claudius and propagation and whatnot so
uh we'll yeah it would be some way down
the list but you know
it's like climbing a mountain isn't it
let me just carry on
at some point we reach the peak and
maybe the peak is having ai that
understands your speaking and
understands what you're trying to
express
i refuse to use any of those things i
don't
i'm a technology person but i don't like
talking to my crap
i just don't
uh
all right we got five minutes uh let's
see how many more we can squeeze in is
binaural audio been considered we were
talking about surround what about
about this um yes so we have internally
tried out a few different hrtfs so we
haven't settled on exactly what we want
for our game yet and i think what we
really want to do is
get back into the get into the new
studio
um
get some solid work done on how the game
sounds it's around and i think that is
the basis for
coming up with a decent binaural slash
hrtf solution is knowing that what it's
trying to express is good in the first
place so
um yeah i think we uh we've got some
work to do with department
uh but it it's all part of our uh
research and it is ongoing okay
uh when the ship was badly damaged the
interior lights change will the audio
team consider providing some alarms and
ambient sound to match the damage status
oh for sure um yeah good
no i'm sorry jack i was just like yeah
well yeah
yeah
yeah we already have some stuff in place
um so like steam will come out and
sparks and things like that we have
audio support for that but yeah
absolutely we should definitely look
into things like alarms and things like
that that's something we really love to
do
we have to tread carefully with alarms
because uh sounds that become annoying
become annoying to use at tartology
you want to hear the most annoying sound
in the world
uh can we please have five minutes of
silence between songs no
pedro
all the time pedro
who wrote this question and how did i
let it get into my list
suppose some people don't want music
going on all the time
i'm sure you can look into that i'm sure
you know i mean a a at a little breath i
think you know it's quite often the
breaths uh and silence in between dude
is important i would have to say i think
uh transitional and just giving giving
the uh listener a break i think that's
valuable it's it's it's a warranted uh
request although we do love our music um
but uh no you know and um
yeah i mean there are there are
locations too that we're considering to
have a bit more ambient stuff too you
know where it's
not full-on melodies and whatnot you can
give yourself a break there as well you
can go to pyro or something
uh are there plans for any of the
abundance of cockpit switches to blast
fortunate sun over the ship's pa no
we're not we already that's done
i need to look closer at these questions
before we do the show we can create an
ai generated uh mimic unfortunately
play me fortunate son
um
uh
will there be an echo in large ship
interiors uh like the merchantman's
giant cargo hall
like you know like not a cargo hold a
cargo hall
yeah we were actually talking about this
just last week about how
one of the big things that we uh we need
is a better early reflection system and
that is what we're talking about here
cargo i've always like yeah perhaps the
sound reflects off um big square distant
walls um so we are actively researching
how we're going to implement this but as
with everything star citizen it needs to
work in every possible gameplay
situation in every scenario in every
planet every bit of geometry and
yeah that's always the challenge we face
uh last two questions uh which audio
element of the project have you found to
be the most challenging to implement so
far
um
in a way a lot of it can be quite
challenging just due to the multitude of
tools we have um so this is something
claudius is really going to help with
where we sort of centralize all of that
but at the minute um an audio designer
can be jumping between maybe three or
four different programs um to get sound
working so um that's one of the harder
bits of it um you don't have to say that
because graham's here jack
[Laughter]
he's just trying to persuade me to
release it more
quickly sorry
how about you
bob um no i i i definitely i would like
to to relate with jack i mean especially
for dialogue too it's it's uh it's going
to actually be a little harder because
unfortunately claudius will it will help
with a lot of the non-character
improvements uh uh i'll be honest but
but still character dialogue does come
from ai and it does come from
subsumption and and uh you know a lot of
that is a bit out of our our hands at
the moment so
um
getting more more support and getting
more uh people from the dialogue team
involved in that will really help us but
but yeah sadly a lot of dialogue is kind
of out of our hands of how it triggers
because it's triggered by the ai
um
and and with subsumption and things like
that so it's just getting into that
black box for our department to to
really help with it and to
uh to expand on it and that that just
takes more more people so if you want to
join the dialogue
we're always hiring classroomgames.com
jobs
a brand new facility to work in so
uh and then last
and perhaps the most important question
we're going to answer here today
will we ever be able to honk a horn
on our spaceships
yes i'm going to say yes
i think draw a line in the sand make it
happen graham
yeah if you want to do this you know we
can get into arguments about whether you
should hear this horn in spain so
whether you need to be an atmosphere to
hear
all these kinds of things but yeah let's
just say yes
and an entire new sub component system
of different horn types i
just put it all on john crew and his
team i'm sure they're up for it
uh uh there will be a day when i can
roll around in my buccaneer and blast la
cucaracha just by
[Music]
there was someone on my street that
would uh have a honk and it was the
godfather
[Laughter]
i'm sure
the ship team would have no trouble
adding a whole new component to every
single spaceship from now on
i'm committing them to it with the power
that i don't have
all right everybody uh that's it thanks
for um thanks for uh
joining us here on star citizen live uh
