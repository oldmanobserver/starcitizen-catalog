oh hello
we talk a lot in the isc about what
developers are making for you the star
citizen community but what you may not
know is that any large games development
there's usually a small team dedicated
to making things strictly for the
developers themselves tools development
is at the very heart of what makes game
development possible and why each year
is often more productive than the last
when building the never before built
it's often impossible to know exactly
what you're going to need when you start
but as time goes on developers begin to
discover all the bottlenecks the process
is that while necessary can often
devastatingly impede their momentum and
perhaps most commonly processes that
work fine for a small game but don't
always scale with a project as massive
as star citizen so we thought we'd take
this week's show and dedicate it to some
of the true heroes gamers never see
behind the curtain and enter the world
of tools programmers
up first let's go to montreal and meet
some of the team there and learn a
little about their most recent effort
the mighty mighty bridge
depend who you ask for
the the toolkit might be the most
important team of a prediction in our
team
the focus is to develop tools for
artists designers and technical artists
the scale in star season is insane so we
can't ask for
artists and designers to make all the
game fully by hand
technically we're on the pre-surgical
side but our tools team is also geared
for our like our on montreal office the
main idea is uh if there is a need if
there is a problem or if there's
anything that could be made any faster
or more simpler for a user then a tools
programmer can go in and
make their life easier
i am the most important part of the most
important team you know
as star citizen is evolving we add more
and more features over time so that
means that we need to be able to set up
and place new type of data and
and so you need new tools for that we
need to
automatize a big part of the job to
move further and faster
obviously there is a lot to do because
the world we try to create is huge
and
what we tend to do as technical artists
is trying to make the link between the
developers and the artists themselves
because the artists are the ones or the
level designers are the ones that tend
to use the tools while the programmers
tend to answer their needs one recent
example of a tool we developed is the
multibridge
mighty bridge is a plugin for the game
editor that link the game editor to any
other software
right now the main usage is to be able
to
work in houdini and have some effects
directly in editor with the mighty
bridge the communication is done in
two-way direction it can send
information and ask stuff to houdini for
example and houdini while doing the
computation is able to say okay you want
to place a cave here give me all the
objects in this 50 meters radius so that
i can add up the recipe and then send
back the result and with other
technologies you don't have that two-way
communication so it's also helped us
doing more complex recipes and adapt the
content to the game level
the reason why the mighty bridge is
important is
there is a lot of
technical resources and knowledge in all
kinds of
amazing tools like as i mentioned before
houdini and by providing a way that
artists can interact with the editor
from the tools that they know and love
and have learned to use over many many
years they can make more easily the
stuff that they want
there's no time in between of like
thinking about the logistics of
everything it just like does it for you
we made the mit bridge thinking about
the future so that if we want to use
other technology we can plug them into
the editor using it and for example if
we want to use blender or vsmax or maya
or substance designer for example that
we are using but if we want to plug them
into the editor we could use my keyboard
to do that
tools programming is a core to however
whoever
interacts with anything to make content
i've been working in the industry for
15
15 years i never found
a project that has such ambitions and i
feel like this game tends to always
say there is
a goal
and we will do whatever it takes to to
reach that goal
mighty bridge is just one of the ways
tools programmers work to improve the
workflow of all developers allowing for
an unprecedented two-way communication
between independently developed
softwares that were never intended to
speak to one another shaving the
downtime and removing the need for
important exports all over the place but
that's not where this week's tools time
story ends for we're about to go big
with a tool that we've been dreaming
about internally since 2019
a way to test our game and
infrastructure at the scales we need
while leaving developers free to
continue
developing
let's meet the cloud test launcher
i remember there were tests in the
company where people asked can we get as
many developers to join to see if
servers work
well we can do this this way but we have
limited number of developers even if
there is quite large number of them
if you take into consideration how many
players there will be in star citizen
you will quickly find out that
we need to have some way to emulate
those users
[Music]
the idea was
created like four years ago the first
iteration was
that you can go to the
developer machines install the software
and
one person could simulate that traffic
using those machines then
came the next iteration of this idea
where we wanted to move that to the cla
actual cloud right now club test
launcher allows us to create machines on
the fly when we need them
launch multiple clients on those
machines and
simulate actual traffic
it actually
launches a star citizen client connects
to the servers and
creates a very realistic testing
scenario because you can say that there
is network traffic you can say that
those players even if they are emulated
they are actually doing something in
star citizen just like a normal
connected client would
so this is quite a big deal
[Music]
as you know we are going to introduce
server meshing and to be able to do that
we need to have reliable testing methods
and cloud s launcher is one of those
methods for example
say that a client should go into a ship
and fly somewhere maybe through a jump
point
which will it would involve switching
servers and so on for us in near future
that will be a very valuable tool to
perform testing
[Music]
of course cloud test launcher is not a
single person project many people helped
in development
i would like to shout out to martin
senior which is my team lead who
developed early versions of the cloud
test launcher also
to java who helps us
in testing phase also ahmed and scott
who helped us with the network part and
cloud
part of the development of the cloud
slanter without them this would not be
possible
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that mighty bridge allows our
developers to use the right tool for the
job wherever that tool may come from and
to do so without having to leave the
game editor that cloud test launcher
will free up our developers in qa from
tedious load bearings testing and allow
them time to focus on new features and
fixes respectively and that at isc we're
going to continue exploring every aspect
of game development before our time here
is done
for inside star citizen i'm jared
huckaby we'll see you all next week
[Music]
you
