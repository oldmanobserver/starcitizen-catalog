stars in live game dev practical
interactable
which is the closest word i could find
to rhyme with interactable
starring jared lewis hi everybody
uh welcome to star citizen live it is
friday uh july 8th
2022
uh
we are hanging out as we are want to do
uh this week is one of our game dev
shows where instead of the normal hustle
and bustle q a and stuff like that uh we
are going to hang out with our
dev du jour uh the wonderful lewis right
here say hi lewis
hello everyone
and louis uh
formerly of the props team
is now on the newly formed and minted
interactables team
so louis why don't why don't we start
with that this is a brand new team that
uh didn't exist before this week
apart you remember the only constant in
game development is change
so uh
what is uh what is the interactives
interactables team interactables team
that's a very good question and uh i
think it's saying that's going to be
hashed out over the coming months a bit
more um but at the moment as it stands
it's basically um a props team 2.0 um
but the goal of this team is to kind of
push the props a little bit further so
whereas we've just kind of done the art
before
um the interactive team is about
interactable so
obviously more complex props with more
functionality um being able to take on a
bit more of the technical setup and
stuff like that um
and kind of be our own entity really so
usually we're kind of just supporting
you know environment team ai team
mission feature team you know diff
different teams we provide support um
but this is going to be more of a kind
of um a team where we can kind of start
shaping our own like game features and
stuff ourselves which is uh really
really exciting so
yeah it's like a props team but a
more in-depth technical version yeah and
and and and prop starters and stuff
still exist there they're they've been
embedded in other teams and stuff like
that so and profs are an absolutely
essential part of
making a space seem lived in and and and
and and a diegetic uh it's one of the
reasons i i've taken as many times as i
have to uh emphasize and highlight the
props team because i'm a big fan of of
their contribution the inter the
interactive team as you just said is
this new kind of thing about
finding a way to build props and stuff
that we can put into players hands and
survey function and not just decorate a
scene and to that end
uh one of uh what are we doing today
louis
i mean
yeah so um
basically um
going in so our team's brand new um and
we're kind of just starting to to find
our feet and get the ball rolling on on
the stuff we have to work on um but
previous to this before we got started
as we were kind of ramping down our work
with um
the previous props team
um we took a bit of time to start
you know looking at what kind of cool
new features we could develop what we're
able to do with the skills we currently
have and then maybe what we're able to
progress into later on so to that end we
kind of sat down and thought okay what
can we do with with props
so um
we we thought it'd be awesome to create
like a cool
um
set of props um that players would be
able to you know maybe pick up take with
them to places
um and place wherever they'd like
um within reason
so um we we sat around and we thought oh
well you won't be really cool maybe
making some form of like you know
camping set um something like that where
players can like load up their ship with
some equipment take them to anywhere in
the verse land uh and and place them and
have little camps and stuff
you know maybe we kind of make little
tableaus make little campsites of their
own and stuff
yeah we went we went wild with the
thought process we were just like you
imagine you know when when all the the
tech comes online and we have like lots
of players on the server they'll
come and set up like
tents and stuff we can have our own like
version of glastonbury
star citizen
and it's not it's not the only
initiative that the the the new
interactive team is tackling this is
just the one that we've chosen to
highlight and explore today uh uh not
everything that we make in star citizen
at live game dev you know goes into the
game but whenever possible
we do try to
piggyback on work that you're already
doing so that we can see the process of
making stuff that will has a better
chance of someday making it into the
game and since
the team is already scoping out camping
gear we thought let's make some camping
gear today so with that i am going to
turn it over to you and push this button
here
um
so we're on the screen share now and
what i see immediately looks like a
metric for a chair oh yes am i right
yeah these are glorious chair metrics so
um
as always we kind of have a starting
point where we've got you know this is
this is how a chair needs to be in
starters and this is the height and you
know the width of
of how it will operate essentially
uh and yeah this is like a this is an
armchair template so when the player
sits in it um
you know they'll have arm support and
stuff
um and yeah this is gonna be our
starting point so what we're going to be
doing
is trying to convert this into a
deployable camping chair so
yeah i'm just going to get started yeah
um
and yeah we'll see where we go so
let me get rid of these first now as
usual as uh lewis works uh um
you are uh we encourage you to submit
questions in the chat
preface with the word question in
capital letters remember that lewis is
an artist on the prop slash
interactables team so if your question
is about the current status of
alpha3172
or
where the banning merchantman
or anything else like that jake
acappella is in the chat and you can
just direct those to him
in fact i encourage you to
yeah i don't know anything just just
just send
every
non-prop
and interactable related question you
have to jake acapella in the twitch chat
right now and if you're watching on the
youtube replay uh you can find them on
twitter and do the same
so you don't have to you don't have to
miss out
just because you're watching a replay
so yeah essentially what i'm doing uh to
begin with is because everything in the
templates all together um we're gonna
start out by separating some of the
parts
just so that we can um
kind of work with them a bit better
because i am not an animator um i can't
rig or skin
um meshes
and apparently i can't do this either um
but yeah essentially um
we want to be able to move these bits
individually so we're going to separate
the arms seat um and the backrest
here's a camping related question
if you were a hot dog
and you were starving
would you eat yourself
i know i would
i put on some ketchup and some mustard
and some relish i'd be delicious
yeah i don't know about that one i
didn't think it would be a very tasty
hot dog tonight there's about 27 people
in chat who got that reference
and you're my people
what's going on what did it
there you guys saw it
no
already having technical issues
pressure's on man
plus is the way of the artist
things never go right when you want them
to
there's only like a thousand people
watching right now and then
a couple ten thousand more on youtube so
it's all right i'll just turn my youtube
comments off for a
two weeks
so you're taking the basic pieces of the
metric laden chair and
reducing them to
what could be like flat pack deployable
parts without changing the overall
metrics so you know that it's going to
fit the player character
yeah so um for example but the main
important things on this are the contact
points so the seat i've i've reduced the
bottom because
you know we don't want to sit on a
massive block that wouldn't be very good
to fold away um the backrest is still at
the same angle but a bit thinner and the
arms are now thinner as well
um but they still have the same contact
points when the player sits down
their arms will still line up with these
surfaces
um
i'm just trying
to work out why my pivot
is not letting me move that's so weird
all right we'll work around it
my guess would be user error
yeah most likely
is this as usual
so i'm going to use these points instead
which is probably a better idea
a cyrenian in the chat says can this be
called a camping chair if it does not
have cup holders
oh
stretch goal cup holders now interesting
like like what we're going to be doing
today is essentially what you would
if you if you were to to pick to find
parody with like the ship pipeline you
might already be familiar with we're
going to be working in white box uh for
most of today where we you know test
functionality and develop functionality
stuff so cupholders is definitely a
gray box slash
a final art
kind of test
but i will say if the camping chair does
eventually make it into the game and it
doesn't have cup holders uh you can go
and message jake acapella on twitter
and share your displeasure
that'd be a cool thing to bear in mind
if i go and take this further
because this this actually started out
as just a personal development task um
but it got to the point where
everyone thought it was actually pretty
cool now like oh let's you know let's
give this a try and show it off
ah interesting
so usually being super precise but i'm
just going to be messy modelling today
so
don't worry this won't be the final
yeah for for
the the interactive team and what we're
attempting to showcase for
your workflow it's more about how the
item can deploy can collapse and can be
ultimately used uh by the player as
opposed to
any fine art
folks who have watched
game dev shows in the past
we've been doing this for a few years
now know that
there's just about nothing in star
citizen
uh with the level of uh fidelity that we
go for uh that can be created in under
an hour
so this will be a representation
of of work except for the uh collected
works of of jeremiah lee his his stuff
is usually done in like 40 minutes with
some time left over to
wonder why nobody likes it
there is um there's some absolute
machines out there they could do our
like absolute machines
uh what did i get to look six
oh why not start with the foldable
chairs we are
we see already present in the cutty
so that'll be a good starting point
we've had um so so part of this was i
did go back and review some of the
artwork that was already made to be fit
for purpose
um but the problem is a lot of them
aren't built with the the animation in
mind
so
um for example we have like a bunch of
camping beds already in the game but
they're not built in a way which means
they can easily be deployed
um so part of
what we want to do
is you know create some art from scratch
that
that will actually work off to get from
the get-go
so you're saying that in in situations
like this it would be more
uh
time and cost effective to
to
adapt the art to the animation you then
try to take something that was already
created and
read
completely redo the animation
exactly yeah because like sometimes when
you're doing modeling um you take you
know you can take shortcuts sometimes
so for example you know if you have like
a folding mechanism sometimes you'll
just model it
as it is folded out and then optimize
the geometry behind where it folds so
that if you actually tried to fold it
like via the animation
um
it would not work
um
just because
sorry i'm really bad at multitasking
just because
you know where you've tried to optimize
it maybe the mesh like isn't clean on
the other side or it just looks you know
a bit jank or some faces have been
deleted to save on you know polygons for
optimization so going forward um so what
we usually do is we we will set up a
template um and then that template has
you know the functionality that we is
required
um and then the artist will go on to
make the actual um final art
and again that's what we're doing here
we are making a template for a
deployable chair like that for
what who is it that
somebody in chat was like i can do
better art than this it's like well the
art's not the point of this particular
demonstration the mechanics and not the
point
oh what is that i just got an i just got
an email from uh
oh it's from jeremiah
oh he's not happy wonder what i said
nothing at all
right so we've got some like legs in
place now um
that are very
very happily named
don't show my boss anyone
um
and then yeah so what we're gonna do
you can expand all these again
basically what we're doing here is we're
just creating a hierarchy so what
happens is if we move
you know this the rest of it moves with
it
if we move this the rest of it above
moves and this just this means when we
come to animate it it's going to be a
hell of a lot easier than having to
animate in each individual
part
so
um
for now
i'm just going to grab all this stuff
and i'm going to keyframe it really
messily
and i've got auto key down here set so
basically when i move any of this it's
going to remember so um
like if i move this piece for example
you'll see that it's placed like a
little marker here
and this means it's remembering uh where
i'm moving these
and you see the entire chair is moving
down with this apart from the backrest
but we'll sort that out in a second
is there a scene available where this
can be placed well the idea behind this
uh uh of a
frost falci i'm not i'm not the
pronunciator is that this is the kind of
chair that can be deployed
anywhere out in the open world that's
that's the whole idea
so it's not one particular or specific
scene
it should be able to go out to microtech
or
out into the
marshes of loreville or
you know whatever
and
chair bed
table
you know be able to set yourself up a
little scene
it would be absolutely amazing to see
like you know player because player
already players are really organized
stuff right so like you know for example
the demar rally um can you imagine if
players could bring their in like
camping chairs and set up and watch
alongside the track and stuff or you
know
later on um
you know we're looking at
potentially getting a programmer
on our team and being able to create
features and stuff like that so
imagine
you know
cooking mechanics maybe
or something like that a deployable
stove
uh where you can cook things to your
mates
you know tents um
one of the ideas we really really liked
the sound of was
football goals
so
bringing a ball a football goal that
deploys along with you
i thought that would be a really cool
idea
but again this was a this here was a
task just to kind of
you know
kind of learn some of the the more
technical stuff
um
in regards to the setup
[Music]
because
i know a lot of the art stuff but in
terms of like setting it up in data
forge and and basically making it
actually work um i don't know it that
well lack of a better word and
interactable
stuff like um when i did the med bed um
that was that was already pre-set up by
a different team um so all i had to do
was place you know the points animate it
um
and then that was that was done so
um
yeah essentially
this was a task to learn the setups
behind creating uh deployables really
bionics says does he mean soccer no he
means football
we're here in loyal subjects of of her
majesty the queen now
so
it's football now
you you wrap scallions you can't be
bringing that kind of chat into here uh
jack hiroshi says what is data forge
please oh that's a that's a that's a
that's a that's a big ask a data forge
oh very cool it's pain it's pain
it's drop down
for just pain this is data forger data
forge is basically the the place where
we keep all of the
connections between every individual
item that makes up the universe
and set up the rules and the guidelines
uh in how that interacts with one
another um
the crazy
insane database at the heart
of the persistent universe
you can find i'm sure some folks who
have been
uh around here around for a while uh
might be able to remember
uh links to old atvs where uh data forge
was being developed originally and we
did some segments on it
way back when
if you're really curious to learn more
about it's a it's a totally internally
developed
way to store
and uh retrieve uh the data that is
necessary to make the persistent
universe work
and it get and one of the biggest things
it did was it got us away from uh
cryengine's xml system for a lot of
stuff
not everything for being completely
honest but for most things
i don't even really know what else you
can compare it to really that's really
really cool it's so
you know what essentially what what i
did
when setting up like the first
deployable that i ever did it was
essentially mashing two data forged
records together and learning how they
both worked and it's a really cool
modular system that actually do stuff
like that it's really awesome
there are other things like it from
other developers that the issue is that
other developers don't share them like
they don't talk about them they don't
expose the thing so
the references wouldn't make any sense
but
sorry it's our version of a of of a
common necessity for mmos
okay cool so what i'm doing here is i'm
again i'm just i'm looking at how the
parts interact with each other and try
and set them up on the left so that it
makes sense and and
you know for example the arms move
because they're attached to the backrest
they need to move with the backrest
right so
that's what that's being set up as yeah
and
so that's when that starts to move down
so
g kenny says
dev whose name i didn't catch that's
lewis can you please make something like
this for the 100 series beds they could
use a chair table now let's see that's
ship team
and and stuff
so
you can uh so uh uh gk you can take your
request and uh if you go to twitter and
send it to jake acapella
uh here i'm typing his name into chat
now
uh so you'll have it there uh just send
the request to jake acapella and he'll
make sure it gets to the right person
he's going to be very upset with you
[Music]
a futuristic fisherman foldable chair
finally something to replace the wobbly
thing i keep using now it could be used
for fishing
don't see why not we're gonna have a
uh we'll have we'll have uh todd pappy
on uh star citizen live next week uh for
an all about alpha 317 317 one and three
seventeen two just all about we haven't
done it all about the patch q a with
todd pappy in a while so he's on next
week
uh talking about the last three
uh patches so uh maybe we'll see if we
can sneak in a fishing question
he loves to talk about fishing
if you want todd pappy to answer
questions about fishing uh head on over
to twitter now and send a message to
jake acapella again the name in the chat
right now
and let us know
it's possible i had too much sugar today
there's no such thing
oh no i need to keep trying that first
oh rotating the arms
yeah so this is what i mean like uh you
know on the template it's gonna look
you know
black yes
because
there's no mechanism for it right so you
know the functionality is implied but
eventually it will be down to the artist
and this means that like
we might see multiple versions of the
chair so you can have like a
you know a high-tech chair
you know maybe it's like very smooth
like panels move out the way and
parts move out of it and stuff or you
can have like you know a low-tech one
which is literally just you know your
default
camping chair that you'd find nowadays
yeah
but again like it's just giving the
intention so that the artist can then
come in later and
do what they want with it pretty much
i think i think it's worth showing i
think i think uh a lot of folks
uh especially outside the star citizen
community who
you know don't have the same level of
development content that that we do here
tend to think that
anything they see in a game was just
built straight to that finished product
and it's not everything has a pipeline
yeah
and you know we we explore the ship
pipeline a bit more than most but
everything has
a pipeline very similar to that with
with white box where you you build these
you build these templates out and you
make sure all the pieces work and they
have space to go into each other and fit
each other and and
not uh
you know not conflict and then gray box
where you start to you know really model
it out and stuff like this and then
you can
address any final problems that get
discovered in gray box
and then go into final art where where
somebody comes in and does the
meticulous uh you know lot zero version
of an asset and then
the you know the tech artists come in
and do the loud versions and the lot
four and the three and the two and the
one versions
and stuff like this it's it's definitely
a
a prolonged protracted process and we
are showing the earliest
parts
of of the the process of creating an
interactable right now which is building
the template
uh if we have some time i think we'll
manage to fit it in uh we can show you
uh a version of something similar that's
a little farther along
uh before we go
definitely yeah um
let's um so what we got so we've got
we've got a closed up state
up to a raised state
so now we just all we need to do is kind
of just grab
uh
grab this we can shift drag it
yeah shift drag it uh oh sir 77 that's a
great question well artists who build
different versions of the foldable chair
be limited to the same style like legs
collapsing straight or can they build
a scissors like folding chair with the
same
interactable template
yes so um
really all this is this is just some
kind of demonstration geometry really
the the main thing um is the actual
record so
you know i was talking about data forge
earlier this is the record for that um
and they can essentially do any kind of
animation they want as long as they
stick to those metrics so you know the
chair metrics so the player always sits
in the same position they're able to
like rest um
and as long as it folds up so they can
carry it in the same the same way and
there's no reason
you know they can't change the animation
up
um you know even if it's a different
size when it's folded down um they've
got the ability to go into this record
and actually change um
down here i think
they've got stuff like the grip data
so they can change you know what
orientations it can be picked up from um
the kind of shape of the grip
so they can change it so you know maybe
it's a flat grip
maybe it's a rounded grip
the dimension of the hands
so they can
you know there's all sorts of feats you
could you could spend all day in this
just looking it up but there's a lot of
customization um to be done through this
and this is essentially just going to be
the base
um the base version um and then people
can you know you can see down here
there's there's all sorts of like
different c chairs 890 c chair
constantine hurston all the different
yep
exactly so they're all they're all based
you know every chair in the game is sort
of based from same original chair right
it's always going to be the same sort of
height and that just means that you know
people can be more flexible in their
approach when making stuff
all the tech travels forever and
yeah
it's cool
beans uh
right
this is where it could collapse in
i know we should be right
uh
why do you need to quickly check
where did i put my
is this a product for armchair devs yes
some proper comedians out there today
uh koala 999 says how does one stay
motivated doing this sounds very tedious
um
to be honest um since the new
team update it's been pretty nice
because um
what it
essentially like we were just making the
art before um and now we have a real
awesome chance to to kind of take our
own work further um and develop our own
stuff so for example this is just
this is all
you know i haven't been tasked with this
specific thing this is just stuff i've
been working on between tasks
so they'll sometimes be like a day or
two
where
you know you're waiting for your next
task or you're waiting for it to kick
off
um so you're just kind of doing prep
work to see you know see how you can
prepare yourself for it
um
and this was one of those tasks for us
we had we had a spare day
um
those things come up uh quite a bit you
know because you know it's something
you're supposed to be working on gets
blocked by a dependency from somebody on
another team
and you need them to finish their thing
before you can continue on the thing
that you're supposed to be working on so
so you find other other tasks to
you know make sure that you're always
being as productive
uh as possible we actually uh uh
i think we have an episode of isc
dedicated to that phenomenon coming up
later this court uh this next quarter i
was just talking to some people about
that about about
the sort of middle tasks the the things
that aren't necessarily uh laid out but
tend to crop up during development when
you have to wait on something from
somebody else or whatnot
um another way that folks are always um
battling
uh tedium and stuff like this uh
you if again if you've been following
the project for any prolonged period of
time you've heard a lot about
this team was supposed to work on this
but they're moved over to this uh this
artist was on this team and they're now
on this team or that team and stuff like
that part part of that
the only constant in game development is
change uh mentality is keeping things
fresh and
interesting and uh motivating for the
people who are
working on the project it's like that so
there's there's
of the many reasons decisions are made
throughout game development
one of them one of the considerations is
always about trying to place the right
person to the right task and the right
person at the right task
that this person might have been the
right person for that task three months
ago but they may not be the right person
for that task today it might be somebody
else because of the last thing they
worked on or just where they are in
their
career development at that time stuff so
it's a
it's a it's an amazing calculus that is
worked out by our producers and our
directors
and you can go back to uh
gosh there was an seo we did
i want to say 2017 2018 where we worked
with producers and built a schedule
out uh
it was it was it was it was it was super
it was super popular like literally we
spent an hour building out a schedule
and i got a lot of
got a lot of crap for it
but but it was you know it's another
essential part of game development to
show the various considerations that
that go into why these people are on
this thing and not this thing and stuff
like that it's a
it's an amazing calculus that i wish
more
game developers talked about
oh
what'd you do
the pk circle of doom is trash matter i
had the camera changed i came back and
you're on a crash handler no
how do you stay motivated um
why are there so many picos in the scene
literally i i click the way i come back
and you've got to crash with like seven
people oh wait you missed the teapot oh
i i avoided the teapot
no no t-bots i'm tired of tea bots
football they wouldn't be able to deal
with t the stupid 3ds max teapot it's
been following me around like a plague
20 years
because
absolute coast
we used to do a thing
uh he's reloading by the way that's why
that's why we're vamping right now uh we
used to do a thing uh when you
accidentally call a group chat on like
teams or slack or whatever and you
accidentally ring 30 people that you
didn't mean to ring
for anybody that picked up we used to
make the person who made the call sing
the teacup song
oh nine
dark days dark days
days indeed
all right so you're back up and running
nah yeah
oh yeah
it's still loading still loading my
computer's like
clocked out i think my computer needs a
way to be motivated more because
she's old now
she's not that old
what's hurston and artcorp's mascot i
feel like
our corp is some kind of anthropomorphic
smokestack
although that could also be rehearsing
for that matter
pollution
pollution is pretty good hurston's
mascot is just a a cloud of dirty
pollution
uh with little stick figures smiley face
it's like a really
high res
uh a very well done up cloud of
pollution with crappy stick arms
and and and and like and like googly
eyes
on it the dirty bubble as as as no no
miso says
and a top hat
whatever they are they are based on a
photo of jared only when jeremiah is
drawing
we don't do that anymore
we we've we we've broken up with
jeremiah we have we have we have
frederick from the turbulent team now
he's much nicer and
doesn't base his work on
unfortunate photos of me
sorry for my head that my editor has
taken its sweet time
um i can show um
our initial exploration of the goal post
if you like
sure
it's a small screen so hang on um
i can work on where i put it and doesn't
break things gabriel will correct
it's the pollution thing from fern gully
there we go
i'm sure ferngill is not using it
anymore we could just take it right from
there all right hold on
all right so so this so this uh set this
up before you play it
okay so um yeah and initially we had
when we had our initial brainstorm of
what kind of deployable stuff we could
do
um
we basically split off into groups so i
did like a
few camping equipment explorations um
and then
another dude on the team dan um he went
away and did this uh
football goal so the idea is essentially
you know you rock up to a planet with
this thing drop it on the ground
um
deploy it
boom
and then um
we'll some will get
you know again a ball working
and then if you know you can set two of
these up on a random field somewhere on
a planet
and then you can have a
football match or a soccer match for
those
who don't agree with my terminology no
no no but you you could use like render
texture to to change the numbers in the
corner and like count the score
one two three you know every time
something passes yeah exactly so
you know it's only initial idea but you
know we can have the color changing we
can have different icons
in different colors for when you score
maybe you know maybe we can get vfx
support we can even have
fireworks going off or sink when you
score a goal
the possibilities aren't endless yeah
you have to set it to like this a
specific ball that goes through other
otherwise people like jake acappella are
just gonna like try to jump through it
and have their
body count
for
things if you want jake acapella uh to
stop a cheating at imaginary uh star
citizen football uh go to twitter at
jacob acapella and tell him to stop
why am i taking so long i don't know i'm
running out of i'm i mean i can i can
only do this jake acapella joke so many
times while i'm trying to cover
keep going
do it
this is sometimes
uh right let's see what else you can do
in here for the time being um
i'll keep an eye on that
so yeah essentially this is the mesh
setup like pretty much
there uh what is this
well actually i'm gonna do i'm gonna
i'm gonna position this in the correct
spot
so this is gonna be
hopefully
um where we can activate and deactivate
this little point here
where we can activate and deactivate the
chair so on a on a final art mesh you
might have it where
maybe there's like a touch screen that
you can interact with or or just a
button
again that's kind of
this is our early exploration right so
later on you know if we did decide to go
forward with this
we might get design involved and and
they basically you know
give us an idea of what else we could do
with it uh whether it should be a screen
or
a button or whatever makes sense really
for what it is
and it's not just limited to
you know chairs or whatever it's limited
you know
by whatever you can animate really so
you can have deployable like any kind of
deployable item so we showed the goal
post for example
oh hallelujah
thank you oh hold on we're not there yet
you know like a little summoning ritual
here
there we go we're back
right
any percent speed run camp chair let's
go
right cool so we're going to test the
geometry make sure we've done the
animation correctly so deploy
that looks right to me
it's not perfect but again we're not
trying to get perfect at this point
we're just trying to get something that
functions so
so happy that
so yeah that um what we're gonna do now
um
so i've set up the date forge entity
prior to this because
there is no way
you lot would want to sit and watch me
go through this for an hour and try and
work out
what i've done wrong there's a lot of
troubleshooting in this stage so
i'll quickly just give you an overview
like a brief overview um
basically these props need to have um
what's called a state machine set up and
this is basically some code that tells
the prop
um
what state it's currently in so i'll
quickly
jump in and
see if this worked correctly
uh they bring up the
debug
so um
don't maximize yourself please thank you
right so um here it says um so currently
it's settled which means it's just
placed on the ground there's nothing
going on with it um
but what we need to be able to do is go
up to it and interact with it
and obviously because it's a chair we
don't want to be able to sit on the
chair while it's in this state because
that would not be a comfortable chair
um
yeah
exactly
so um yeah basically the state machine
tells the prop
um what it can
what interactions we can have with it in
its current state so settled um you
can't do anything with it apart from
pick it up
um or activate it so
you can see here
i wonder if this will work no so this is
one of the problems i had before the
stream i couldn't get this quite working
on this one um but yeah essentially
you'd be able to use this to pick it up
and carry it about um it's not working
for this demo and i can show you on an
asset layer that it does work on
but for now
there should be
an interaction somewhere
but it alas it looks like it is not
there
so we'll go back and quickly check
so we have got
you see all on the left there you see
all the little parts that make up this
incredibly simple
just template version of the chair
wait till it actually gets built out
yeah so i mean this is just you know
primitives at this point but on an
actual mesh you'd have all sorts of
moving parts and that's when it gets
extremely complicated and when you have
stuff like you know
the suggestion earlier about the scissor
um
like this is the chair version yeah um
you know you you'd probably want an
animator to basically rig that so they
all move correctly um
and anchor to each
other my animation knowledge is pretty
basic
so
we do what we can here we go
so we've got an activate so now you see
the state current state deployed so
you'll notice when i move over it it
says deactivate now um
because yeah you wouldn't be able to run
the
the activation animation if it's already
out
and then yeah we've got seating
functionality unfortunately this is
another book that i've not been able to
solve it's become the chair before but
yeah i mean just become the chair when
in doubt just become the chair
like so many of us over the pandemic
all right we've got we got about 15
minutes left why don't we why don't you
show them the other thing that's a
little further along
sounds good to me
so that's that's the start of something
you know chair building a bit building a
template uh some rudimentary animation
tests stuff like this uh this next thing
is a bit further along if we were
talking like we've been comparing it to
the ship pipeline if that was
like the absolute early white box since
i mean you literally saw it 40 minutes
ago it was nothing
this would be a little closer to early
gray box
assuming it loads and doesn't crash
i'm safe have faith we can do this if it
crashes we will blame uh but you know
who will blame
it work don't worry
and if it doesn't
then
and don't worry about it
we've switched to screen share because
all you're missing on the screen share
is a is a spinning donut i think we've
already just been doing it
so
it just it doesn't like loading into
levels it it basically crashes the
editor but if you if you let that
intimidate you into closing it in task
manager then it never loads so you have
to be patient with it it's one of the
things like
you think about the game like the
release game that's that's alpha state
and it comes with its own level of bugs
and instability
and then you think about ptu below that
and it comes with its own level of bugs
and stability then you think about
evocati before that and it comes with
its own bugs and instability then you
think about isc where isc is capturing
stuff and its own bugs and even before
evocati so that you know another trouble
that we go through getting footage for
that
then at the bottom of that is scl it's
like now we're making something from the
very beginning
from the absolute thing imagine the bugs
in the instability and that's
what you're seeing
so
we won't tell you what happened
but the editor crashed it's working as
intended don't worry
i then i don't know i'd love to hear any
suggestions people had for interactables
because
obviously sure
all the good ideas come from the
community right yeah everybody as far as
remember an interactable is a thing that
as a
character as a person
you would be able to carry
and then place
you you know down somewhere you have to
place it and it deploys so think about
it
say the word interactive think about
deployable
uh
that might that might help the the
nomenclature cooler boxes for food
the banu prayer bowls
um oh no i'm sorry don't put them here
in chat uh go to twitter
and i'm sorry
i can't i can't keep it up even i have
to stop i'm going to get an email
[Music]
now baseball bat is not a deployable
baseball bat is a melee weapon that i've
been asking for for years
and that is technically
there there there was one in the uh
in the
digital citizencon demo last year
it wasn't used but if you watch it it
was there behind the counter at the
outpost
so yeah so it's annoying that we've got
that fine line between
weapons and and props sometimes
and while i'd love to make a deployable
baseball bat listening
weapons team would get that pleasure
baseball still exist in 2952 you're darn
right it does
baseball and professional wrestling
that's it everything else has died out
and professional wrestling are still
going in 29-52
and they're right dave haddock
he's not saying no so
come on you can do it you know what i'd
like in in 29.
what what year are we in for star
citizen now 29 29 52. it's only 1952
yeah like a working
working
loading bar
mate nah it behaves most of the time
it's only when it's been live streamed
carriable missiles that explode when you
drop them when those recarriable bombs
a hand cart a little little deployable
hand cart
that would be a oh my god
that would be stress
i did most i did a lot of the setup on
the original trolleys and
they are pain
they got a lot of uh helpers and stuff
yeah uh the deployable shields and stuff
that's that's been on the that's been on
the want list for a long long time
uh deployable racing checkpoints yeah
that's also been on the list you uh
we we start we're talking about scramble
races
a couple years ago
uh one of the things that got
reprioritized
uh down the list a bit but i was having
a conversation with somebody about
scramble races internally just earlier
today
and i said the words
don't pull the rug out from under me
when it gets further along then we'll
talk about it
um
so that stuff
deployable titan suit i don't know what
that is
that sounds like something sean tracy
mentioned once again what time you say
no
nope
that's on that's on sean tracy he
mentioned that once like however many
years ago and it's
pain in my butt
deployable jared i'm already deployed
i'm here
oh oh oh oh oh my god
the brightness
this is what we're looking at right now
everybody just in case you think you're
missing the show
we're looking at a very bright error
report
we're vamping
and this might have been the reason why
i called the thing we were going to do
in the last five minutes 15 minutes
early
yeah i mean
that was a pro a pro strap
are we going to try again
right
just wait for it to load in
i don't know all my being so slow you
might turn this i might turn this back
down just for the oh it already is
all right i'm just going to be very slow
with it
my pc's got stage fright
slowly i move
step by step
that's the mood
[Music]
oh now the frame rate returns right cool
let's see if
i set up earlier
the frame rate gets crushed by the
zoomed screen share so you've got the
frame rate
but here on the here on the
show
all right so we see something in the
back of the cutlass here
what are these
oh my god
i'm stuck i'm saying
so
we arrive at this beautiful location
that's obstructed by this very large
object
may have to change the way it's being
held
yeah that's something like i said
this is a
this is an early whip but yeah
lovely location so what we're gonna do
is we're gonna
do do me a favor
before you do this go up to zoom and
change it to optimize for video so we
can get a better frame rate on this it's
at the top of zoom
oh okay yeah little bar that shows up
there
it's gonna lower the picture quality a
bit in the screen share but it'll give
us our frame rate back
this the this is zoom kill in the live
stream right now there you go there we
go it's not better a little bit
we're working with zoom we're working
with what we got
when we're all back in the office we'll
be able to do this
live
without the needed screen shares it'll
be nice
so yeah this looks like a nice spot
this is like one of those really bad e3
demos from before you know when they
they've got like a clearly scripted
section
yeah i think we're set up here guys
sorted
i can sit down and chill
here third person so we can see it
there
so yeah this is just the functioning
prototype
so there's still some junk to work out
you know obviously like we won't be able
to do stuff like log out
on these beds because then you've
essentially got mobile
you know mobile camping points so you
just log back in
you know outside jump tower swing and
well now wreak havoc
not on the entry level tier one one
anyway
yeah yeah the the subscriber only pushes
no
no that's not to say
there can't be something down the line
that players work their way up to yeah
for sure
but essentially like that's what
interactables is going to be about it's
about you know what can we do as one
small team with what we know now in
order to bring more kind of emerging
gameplay to the the pu
um and giving players tools to you know
make their own game play um
you know stuff like this doesn't take a
huge amount of time compared to you know
the other you know massive missions that
are being created and and the other
content so
you know in those in those patches where
maybe there isn't as much content you
know
we can create some cool stuff that will
hopefully bolster some
some additional gameplay and
and create opportunities for
stuff
and when you're done clean up your
litter pick up
run back to your ship
it's even funny when you look at this
perspective
yeah that definitely is a pass by the
actor feature team be like is this how
we should be carrying this
is this proper center of mass
this is perfect this is fine
but yeah uh somebody's already much uh
mentioned this could be used for like
stretchers
oh yeah you know stretcher to to carry
people off the
off the field of
battle and siege of origin or something
yeah like uh essentially so this was um
like i said because we're a brand new
team this is for me to learn how to
create this stuff essentially
and i've you know i've combined an
existing thing like a bed a chair uh
with a carryable
um and using those same techniques i've
learned you know i can probably look at
other things in the game like i know
we've got the
the gurneys and stuff
and the trolleys and we can look at
making
deployable versions of those too and and
just see where the future can take us
really
um
and then hopefully when we get you know
additional support and the team grows um
we'll be bringing you know
more or more complex stuff into the
universe i think this is really the
start of something really really awesome
i'm very excited about it and i know you
know the team is as well so
it's cool beans
will hayne is sending me tips for how to
load uh microtech quicker in the editor
and i'm not loading it will hayne lewis
is
send the tips to lewis
tip one
don't load into microtech
all right so yeah that that does oh you
want to show one more time here then let
me go there you go yeah yeah i'm just
going to mess around now like well no
we're done we're out of time
what are you going to do you try to
stack one on top of another
i'm just making campsite but i'm happy
to sign up when you are
i just like messing them out with these
it's it's fun running around placing
them and
and just
doing little configurations
well having seen you in third person
running around with this i want it to be
an improvised melee weapon
just fold up your comfort bed and fight
off wildlife just beat somebody to death
with a deployable camping bed
oh we got an upside down
it's a camping bed with teeth
the views and opinions of lewis do not
represent those of clad imperium games
frogger space industry
or it's subsidiaries
that is satisfying
and that's just a template like give me
give me like two weeks or something to
work on a set and i will come up with
the most
amazing animation yeah but you know beds
chairs tables
lights
uh
tents i mean
this isn't me promising you that all
those things are coming i'm just talking
about these are the things that will be
that that are will be explored and
you know test it out you just bang your
head on the
i love that
i love our game so much we'll just end
the show there we'll end the show there
all right everybody
thanks for taking the time to hang out
with us this week's uh star citizen live
game dev uh
slightly less than practical
interactables
isc is still on hiatus we're coming back
uh june 28th
uh so uh you know keep the fires going
for that alpha 317.2
is still on the ptu uh being tested and
making progress every single day make
sure you check out the
robertsspaceindustries.com website and
the various socials for details on
whether that goes wider or when it goes
live and stuff like this and then don't
forget uh a special thing that made a
well we'll get to that don't forget
foundation festival is going on right
now uh whole big thing with the guide
system your chance to to get all kinds
of new uh
paints and stuff i don't know the
details but again like always check out
the robertsfaceindustries.com website to
learn more
and then something i want to make sure
is on your radar that might not be it's
a special kind of thing it's first of
its kind on july 22nd the community team
from
from star citizen that's tyler and ulf
and and and and and dan and all i
already said off and others uh coming
together with the community team uh from
eve uh they have a dan
and that's the only one that's the only
one i know uh they are coming together
here in manchester with me stuck in the
middle uh running the broadcast they are
gonna
live stream for charity uh we're gonna
be raising money for extra kids that is
on a july 22nd so look out for more
details like the start time uh and stuff
like that it promises to be
um
some something unlike
we've done in the past it's the best i
can tell you uh i'm along for the ride
on this one so we'll we'll see how it
goes uh but it should be a lot of fun
regardless so battle of the bricks uh
july 22nd check that out uh we will be
back here on twitch next friday uh with
with the man the myth the legend the
eyes uh todd pappy for all about alpha
317 317 1 and 317 2. uh the question for
that the question thread for that
usually goes up on spectrum on monday so
keep an eye out for that uh everything
related to the last three uh patches of
star citizen is on the table and me
trying to work in one question about
fishing so yeah so louis thank you for
taking the time to to to be here uh on
the on the show this week um i think the
uh i'm personally excited about the new
interactables team i know it's a very
small it's a very new i mean literally
it was just created this week initiative
so i'm excited to see it grow and all
the things that come from it so take
care we are going to raid looks like
we're raiding a j fish
uh uh that's probably jake acapella who
did that jake acapella is rating j fish
so when you see j fish say hi jake
acapella sent sent me and don't forget
to visit his twitter
what's the
music i'm suddenly hearing music are you
hearing music in the background
just start start the raid jake i don't
that was your music wasn't it
good music going just start the raid
start
you had music going didn't you
maybe i started to hear it for a while
