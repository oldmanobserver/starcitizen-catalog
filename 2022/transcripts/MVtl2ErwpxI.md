recently i did an update in our pu
meeting to show off some of the work
i've been doing on the new automatic
river placement tool which is going to
allow our artists to populate entire
planets with water systems in a very
simple process
[Music]
and jared saw it and asked me if i could
present it again for an inside star
citizen episode so here we are it's time
to look at automatic river placement
the first big improvement i've made to
the river placement tool is an overhaul
of the ui i've split up all of the stuff
it can do into separate tabs so we have
the manual river placement here the
automatic river placement uh a view of
all of the rivers currently on the
planet we'll visit this again later
view which is how we can enable or
disable various debug view modes and
debug tools which is just a collection
of various other things that i sometimes
use to make sure that my tools are
working properly
if we go over to create river the next
biggest improvement i've done
is river prediction
what the river prediction does is it has
a look at kind of the rough direction
water would travel if you were to place
a river under the mouse what this allows
us to do is look at the general
direction of the height maps the general
shape of the watershed and roughly how
long a river will be
as you can see as i move my mouse across
the planet we can see different
positions are more effective than others
and different positions lead to longer
or shorter rivers
this is microtech so there's no oceans
to flow into but the aim would be on
hurston for example
most of our rivers should either be
finishing in the ocean or large lakes or
basins
what the prediction doesn't do is take
into account the intricacies of the
terrain that may prevent a river from
actually spawning that location
so this is used as an indication of
where the river might go
and then our more in detailed erosion
algorithm can work out whether the river
actually goes there i'm going to attempt
to manually place the river here i'm
going to click
as you can see we've now got a set of
nodes
and this part of the process hasn't
changed so i'll still go down to the
river
click on any of the nodes
and
i will click place river
and boom we've got our river i can then
hide the debug nodes
and the river is there in the world
as simple as that
but actually we're wanting something a
little more complex than that we're
wanting entire water systems across the
entire planet and that's what the auto
river placement tab is for
the automatic river placement is split
up into four steps the first step is the
gather
this looks for positions where we have a
rough idea that there will be a river
that fulfills certain criteria and we
use the prediction that we saw a moment
ago to do this
we can change various settings such as
the target river quantity the min macro
steps which is the number of those large
steps we saw a moment ago for the river
to be considered and the number of
attempts of positions it will do while
trying to find these
in this example i'm just going to try
and find five rivers across the planet
and i'm going to say each of them needs
to have at least nine macro steps so
we're talking about pretty long rivers
we can also select which biomes we want
the rivers to be able to flow through in
this case i've selected all of them
apart from the snowy ones
so when i'm happy with my settings i
will click gather river proposals
and the computer will take a moment over
finding some river proposals for us
as this is happening you can see red
circles appearing on the planet they are
all of the proposal positions that
fulfill the criteria we've put so far so
they're in the correct biome and they
have the correct number of macro steps
or more
it's told me that it's found 25
potential river positions which is
awesome so the next step is to filter
them
currently what filtering does is make
sure that the river isn't going to flow
through an outpost
it checks that the river is valid and
that the water is actually flowing along
the line that the prediction thought it
would and it checks that it's another
minimum length in this case it's 40 node
steps
so i'll click filter and we'll wait for
the computer to do that for me during
this process we can see that some of the
red circles will start to disappear as
they're discarded if they've not met the
filter criteria
right in the end it's actually only
found four valid river positions which
is fine because i put in some pretty
stringent criteria so at this point i'm
going to click create rivers
this is going to actually place the
rivers into the world
and we know that they're already going
to match a certain length and other
criteria that we've put in
now that we've got four new created
rivers the next step will be to commit
all of them but actually i'm going to
hesitate slightly i'm going to go across
to the rivers tab and i'm going to
filter to rivers that are uncommitted
so this is showing me all four rivers
that have not been committed yet
which means that they are on the planet
and they are present but they haven't
been saved to data
and i'm going to go to each of them and
commit them manually
so first uh let's sort by length
so we'll start off with our shortest
river
so as we can see this river flows
through like a woodland biome and it
looks pretty nice but it is only five
kilometers long as we can see here so
i'm actually going to delete this river
next we'll go to the next shortest river
this one is six kilometers long
and looks a little better to me uh i
think i'm going to let this one stay
go to the next river
[Music]
yep very happy
eleven kilometers long
so got a good length on that
one this one is 12 kilometers long
and again looks very similar
so you have these four rivers i'm happy
with through them and i'm going to let
them all stay
going forward i'm going to
allow artists to specify minimum final
length in kilometers rather than just
notes
and one of the big things i'm going to
do next is spring points what this is is
artists will be able to add hint
positions at various points in the
height maps to say a river would look
good starting here for example a crevice
or a crack in a mountainous height map
and that's just going to mean that the
quality of our automatically placed
rivers is just going to be a step higher
because the start is always going to
look somewhere natural rather than just
starting anywhere in the middle of a
field because at the moment it is
largely random positions that it's
trying and then filtering from there
so that's what i've been up to with the
river stuff recently in between fixing
bugs for patches and stuff i'm really
happy with the progress i've been able
to make on this and it's really cool
being able to show it off again uh
hopefully we will be having a lot more
rivers on a lot more planets coming to
the verse very soon
[Music]
like many features throughout star
citizen's continuing development river
continues to evolve into a robust set of
tools that will bring new life and
personality to any planet or moon it's
used on and you can expect more of these
estuaries to branch their course of
rivulets and tributaries in the upcoming
alpha 318 but up next a look at the
newest vehicle from anvil making its
debut in 317-2 the centurion
the anvil centurion is the anti-air
turret of ground vehicles
this is the vehicle that you pull up
when something
flying around above you needs to not be
there
and in 317.2 it's going straight to
drivable
the centurion basically is the same
style of ballista
uh but instead of missiles we are having
a turret with four uh big guns
in order to accommodate those sizeable
laser repeaters it has gained in
addition to what the ballista has two
size one
coolers
uh which are mounted just at the rear
we create a new kind of hatch so that it
looks uh it is central
and he's not slightly
going on the right or slightly
going on the left this is just one we
used to have just
turrets with two s2 guns one left and
one right and in this time we have an
asymmetrical structure for having a
symmetrical gun
in the interior we also try to implement
something that was not done in the
ballista like the camera now the camera
will show part of the guns
so that you have a better sensation of
where you're actually aiming without
even needing to
at the center of the screen with an icon
to show you where bullets are going
[Music]
we have a section with all the
components
and one more part dedicated to the power
plant
[Music]
one of the drawbacks to the ballista is
that
once something gets close enough to it
it becomes that little bit less
effective however that's not a problem
for the centurion it can engage anything
at any range but obviously its
effectiveness will drop off as things
get further away
so having a centurion covering a
ballista suddenly just makes the entire
system work much better
[Music]
i think that players who enjoy the more
organized style of
planetary warfare will have a lot of fun
with it
so what did we learn this week well we
learned that the latest advancements in
rivertech are going to allow artists to
crisscross the surface of stanton's
planets and moons with more brooks and
streams than ever before
that i've used almost every word in the
thesaurus for river in these hosting
bits
except ronald
and that the centurion is the newest
vehicle using anvil's famous atlas
platform and makes a devastating one-two
punch with the ballista that we all know
and love
and as for where we are right now it may
not look like much just yet but give it
another quarter and you're gonna see
some serious ship for inside star
citizen i'm jared huckaby we'll see you
all next week
you
