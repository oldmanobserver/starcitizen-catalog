hello my name is John Griffiths I'm a
lead environment artist here at Star
Citizen at Cloud inferior I'll do that
again
hi my name is John Griffiths and I'm a
lead environment artist at Cloud
impairing games I'm heading up EU
sandbox 2 and we're working on the
revamped underground facilities which
you saw at citizencon this is also my
first ISC episode and it's also the
first in-hour lovely new office so I
hope you enjoy
foreign
so after we've gone through that kind of
concept development phase where we're
just flashing our ideas it's time to
kind of think about what actually the
underground facilities were going to be
how much time is the player going to be
spending there what are they going to be
doing there
um how many they're going to be what
kind of themes they're going to be all
that jazz we need to think about and we
also need to plan out how we're going to
do it so when we're in the stage of very
early on in development it's about kind
of iterating quickly getting into the
editor getting feedback on what we're
doing playing the location as a complete
thing as fast as possible because only
when we see things in context of what
they're going to be can we really make
actual great decisions on what it is
we're making and this is a collaboration
between Art and Design Mission content
the directors are involved it's um just
molding the Beast into something
tangible which we can then take into our
planning stage to iron out what it is we
need to create and how we're going to
create them
[Music]
so we've come out of pre-production we
now need to get a plan together so that
the team can start working so at the
moment we can see all these boxes all
the ones on the top are rooms all the
ones underneath are overlays so overlays
give us our variety when the team looks
at this
they don't have to come to me to ask
does the surface structure medium need
work doing to it or not
um they can read it for themselves here
this is great because it gives us a big
overview of what's required for the
location and it also means that we can
break it down into kind of content packs
so our tier zero is everything that we
would need to release this into the
universe with some variation
I tip our tears after that kind of our
additional content which might flesh out
some of the ugfs or give it a new theme
or that kind of thing so some of the
rooms that are in production at the
moment let's just skip over to them so
this looks like
um one whole thing it's actually two
things so it's the surface structure
which is this little this guy in the
middle and this kind of surrounding
Hangar you know how do you actually get
there
we've also got our physical elevator
spaces so if we go from the top this is
where you trundle down into the ugf on a
lovely diagonal elevator
we've got the Elevator Shaft components
himself so you might have really long
elevator eyes you might have really
short ones and then the where you end up
at the bottom of the elevator ride you
know this room is currently in progress
as well this is a more refined plant to
begin with but we still need to get into
the actual numbers of how much time this
will actually take to make
so then we come to our trusty Microsoft
Excel and in here this is
um just really just putting estimates on
how long we think things will take so
for us that's um in this next phase
which is white boxing we want to block
the rooms out we want to add content we
want to get the gameplay in there we
want to split things into overlays test
it with our proc gen tool and get all
that done so we estimate this like this
and we cut in all of those rooms that we
called out before we've got all the room
types it can be and how big or small the
thing is so using this kind of grid we
can call out while there's a one room
that's got a re-theme there's a two
rooms a medium or large that needs to be
done
and this calculates how much time is
required so you can look at it from room
type you can do the time that way or you
can look at how many medium rooms well
it will take you know we can do it that
way as well this calculates it all puts
into a lovely little
um table and then we can also call out
how many artists there are how many
designers
um how many days per artist how many
total days for a Sprint blah blah blah
get all that done and that gives us our
kind of ballpark figure to to go with to
begin with
um I think I might have to retake this
at what point do we ignore at what point
do we ignore all this okay so it's all
great having all of this and it gives us
a really good plan to begin with going
forward but as you probably know game
development isn't really a concrete
process you can have all the numbers in
the world but you'll still have things
that kind of crop up out of nowhere that
is what game development really is so
from this point now we can get back into
the editor we can start fleshing out
these rooms we can start doing these
overlays we can start finding the
variety and I'm really bringing these
new underground facilities to life
the new underground facilities first
seen at this year's citizen gun showcase
have already moved into production with
designers and artists alike building out
the currently specced out 93 different
rooms and 196 overlay variations
necessary to place them throughout the
existing Stanton and upcoming pyro star
system but while that's still many
months away yet let's go ahead and turn
our attention to something coming in
this December's Alpha 318. the eminent
arrival of the next exciting parts of
our new gen 12 renderer now bringing
with it our Collective hopes for
improved performance let's go now to
Sylvan in our Frankfurt Studio who's got
an update for us on the current progress
hey everyone I'm silver I'm an engine
programmer here at Chu working on gen 12
for the past years and I'm incredibly
excited to share with all of you the
latest progress we've made on gen 12.
but first
um let's get everyone on the same page
real quick and explain which involve is
what it's not and what's trying to solve
this will just stretch the surface
though
um for deeper look I highly recommend
watching our last year's citizencon
progress update on gen 12 and Vulcan
so gen 12 in a nutshell is our new
renderer and we came up with this name
as a natural step forward from DirectX
11 with Star Citizen right now pretty
much all of you are using when playing
the game
dard X11 is a graphics API which our
engine interacts to make use of the GPU
and renders all of Star citizens Beauty
how fast in game engine can feed the
graphics API or the GPU with rendering
commands is dependent on two factors
first the CPU performance and second the
implementation of the rendering engine
and the latter is what gen 12 is all
about it is from the ground up a
complete redesign of our old rendering
architecture
which decreases CPU submission time
massively
the end goal of gen 12 however is to
make use of a new graphics API called
Vulcan which will boost performance even
more and also allows us to add new cool
features like AI scaling Ray tracing
efficient multi-fue rendering for VR and
Linux support and more
this meant however we had to rewrite
every single Graphics feature and ensure
that it's running smoothly and as
expected on this new architecture
a daunting task which takes years in a
game like Star Citizen with its hundreds
of different shaders thousands of
materials and dozens of features
actively used in production
you've seen our first Milestone mid-last
year 2021 with patch 3.14 only had a few
post-processing effects running on gen
12 by default
this proved that our new rendering
architecture was working as intended and
we could start heavily focusing on the
scene object rendering which is the
biggest and the most time consuming task
for gen12
almost a year later with 3.17
we hit our next big milestone and could
turn on gen 12 for all our static
geometry including all scattered terrain
objects
that was also the time when a lot of
people saw an actual meaningful
performance Improvement in Star Citizen
although to be fair that patch gen 12
was just one of many optimizations we
employed there
the thing is since then the engine is
running in a sort of mixed mode which
means
most of the code is running through
Legacy and just calls into gen 12 which
is ported and works at the moment this
actually adds an additional overhead and
is the reason why I didn't expect
anything of a big performance
Improvement
um the last patch and we didn't show
anything or didn't announce anything
but
I'm happy to announce and very proud
that we're nearly done with porting
absolutely everything to gen12
and not just the scene object rendering
but also our new path Centric rendering
system
as we speak we're fixing the last few
things to get it fully ready for 3.18
this is not a promise but we're working
hard to make it possible
also keep in mind that this first
version of gen12 is just a it just works
version
we haven't even started optimizing it
yet at all and you can expect huge
improvements the following patches up
until we can finally start making use of
Falcon
enough talking let's hop into the engine
and take a look at a couple scenes while
I'm explaining a few things to set
reasonable expectations keep in mind
that all of these tests are done in
debug builds with one set of hardware
and can result in a totally different
experience on a different machine
also note that gen 12 primarily boosts
CPU performance so if you have a weak
GPU or playing very high resolutions
which is really demanding for gpus your
game is probably GPU bound and you won't
see much of a benefit
okay so let's take a look at the scene
here in Orson which is one known to be
one of the most expensive cities in game
right now
before we start please do me one favor
and don't look at the FPS because this
is a highly unoptimized build with
highly unoptimized code and very
expensive debug tracking so any
discussion about FPS here is completely
meaningless
all right so on the right side we have
this g3d API call info window which
tells us precisely how many draw calls
and
how many API calls we do every frame
this is the work the engine has to do to
send commands to the graphics driver
which determines how fast the CPU can
fit the GPU with commands to render our
frame
this is pure legacy mode we have 47 000
API calls and let's switch it to channel
12.
so this is Gen 12th mode
the API calls drop to about 33
000. which is quite significant for
literally rendering the same scene
okay let's take a closer look behind the
scenes
well let's take a look at this optic
capture from that scene and Orson
alt is a very helpful tool for us
developers to get a detailed
understanding of what's going on in our
engine
this includes what every threat is doing
and when it is doing it
so let's take a look at the main and
render thread which are relin for us in
this context
let's zoom in
[Music]
and let's take a look at one of those
frames here
so at the top we've got the main thread
the main thread is what you could say
the heart of the whole engine
it pretty much orchestrates everything
like when it when entities get updated
when physics get calculated
when do we render
and so forth
one of the main tasks is to figure out
which objects are in our view system and
which objects you want to render
this is what the main thread does
on top of here
once we figure that out all that work is
pushed into a queue to be processed by
the arena thread
[Music]
at the bottom we've got the render
thread
and this is a very CPU intensive task
which is why it is leveraged by a
completely dedicated threat
so what we can see here is that during
the thread takes an immense amount of
time to process one frame in fact it's
so long
that it even surpasses the work the main
thread has to do
in this context it means we are Renault
thread bound
which means if we optimize the render
if we get it to run faster
we will see more FPS on the screen
as long as we are not GPU out
so let's take a look at the gen12 frame
so here we've got the 10th wall frame
now the opposite is the case the render
thread 2 runs faster than the main
thread which is indicated by this red
bar here at the end
this means the internet thread has to
wait for the main thread to finish
and and in reality bound scenarios as
long as we're not bound by the GPU we
will see an FPS increase
and if we zoom out here we can see that
every frame
the random thread is
quite faster than the main thread
and
yeah weights up to 20 milliseconds on
some frames
where's the Legacy
yeah the opposite is the case and the
Matrix has to wait
to summarize with the current central of
renderer we saw a tremendous amount of
API call reduction than before and
depending on the C 50 to 100 percent
faster in the third performance let me
emphasize again that all these numbers
are not final and we haven't been
optimizing gen 12 at all yet and you can
expect more improvements in the future
it also depends highly on the hardware
you're running at so once it hits live
and you're using it let me know how it's
working for you so what's coming next
you may ask
well once we're fully done with gen12
and we can actually run Vulcan
there's still a lot of optimizations we
have to do like actually completely
getting rid of the Arena thread employ a
fully multi-threading rendering approach
doing async compute and so much more
this guy is the limit here
and since we're developing Vulcan in
parallel at the moment
it is to be expected that once gen 12 is
fully working it won't take long for you
to have it in your hands too
but more about that in the future when
it's actually ready
last but not least a big shout out to
everyone involved in getting gen 12
ready so far
and yeah I hope you like this little
sneak peek into the future of Star
Citizen schweinering engine
and feel free to drop any questions
spectrum and I'll gladly do my best to
answer them
thanks
so what do we learn this week well we
learned that resource planning is an
essential step to ensuring our artists
and designers are working efficiently to
deliver locations like the new
underground facilities quicker than ever
before that the new underground
facilities themselves are already in
production and you can bet we'll be
following along with their progress
ahead of their scheduled release next
year and that the New Gen 12 renderer
looks to relieve much of the current CPU
bottleneck in the persisting universe
and that work will still continue after
the next major milestone in the upcoming
Alpha 318. now don't forget that this
year's day of the Vara Halloween
festivities are going on right now you
