## Transcript

Hello everybody welcome to another
episode of Star Citizen live I'm your
host Jared Huckabee and Star Citizen
live is where we take an hour out of the
end of our week and we chat with our cig
developers and staff uh talking about
the folks and the way that we make our
video games each and every week on
today's show we have members from the
vehicle feature team Richard Tyler and
Yogi kladon to discuss a follow-up to
their recent citizencon presentation so
without further Ado we're just going to
jump right into it this week Rich how
you doing man yeah I'm Graphics it's
great to be here it's Chris that's my
first time on here so it's your first
time with the new talk show setup right
great yeah it's cool amazing Yogi you're
joining us from Frankfurt say hi uh well
from my work office yes uh practically
from Frankfurt not quite Frankfurt but
yes hi is it as cool as my spaceship uh
no I don't think so all I have is like
this little picture here behind me um
other than there's nothing Spacey here
but you do have you do have the the Pico
Yoda show me the Pico Yoda real quick oh
well I've got well I've got to be
showing this so so there's there's Pico
right there's Yoda and they're good
friends and they're swapping like
clothes and all that so
yeah
all right so Yogi was showing that up
before we started the show
um so let's jump into it we are at
citizen con this year uh we did we did a
our kind of our typical vehicle feature
experience uh uh segment where we talk
about you know the the evolution the
continuing evolution of our flight
combat uh and this year we announced
Master modes which was a pretty dramatic
change to the way that our uh our our
single our Single Seed ships our dog
fighters whatnot are going to handle in
the verse that's currently in testing
right now under the Squadron 42 Branch
uh without rehashing the entire
presentation uh for folks who may maybe
haven't seen it uh what is Master modes
who wants to take it
I'll take it okay so um Master mods is
basically our way of
fixing the combat in the game but also
allowing the ship experience and the
ship roles to kind of fulfill themselves
um so early on in the combat we tried
several things we've seen the community
knows about you know we tried to patch
on things to help combat to help fix it
and nothing really works so we looked at
what's the fundamental problem with the
kind of combat and the ship geometry
that we have in the game right now and
the common denominator with speed
um but we didn't want to come up with a
way which was right let's just blanket
cap the speed because if you go too fast
it breaks the game
um
we just didn't want to do like an
overall action kind of cap you know
because there's still so many things
you're doing Star Citizen Beyond combat
you know you've spent a lot of time
traveling from A to B
um and you know the distances we have in
the game are crazy you know we travel
millions of kilometers all the time in
the game I do want to clarify when you
say speed you're saying high speed yes
high speed too much speed yes because I
think from uh from a Layman's
perspective from an outsider's
perspective you know for those of us who
watch racing and watch you know you know
combat movies like Top Gun and anything
speed is more speed seems to be a good
thing it seems to be the thing that
makes stuff exciting makes stuff
visceral everybody likes you know
bobbing weaving through Canyons as fast
as possible but you're saying too much
speed actually hurts the combat
experience yes yeah so if you're
traveling very quickly the distances you
cover in that amount of time become
really large so if you're having a dog
fight with someone and you're flying at
a thousand meters per second within a
very short amount of time you could be
three or four kilometers away from your
target if you've turned around and then
you're flying back towards each other
and then you basically repeat the action
and you start firing at nose of your
opponent and that's not really fun
because you don't get you know it makes
it really hard to balance it makes it
really hard for the weapons to make a
difference the different types of
weapons we have in the game
so the goal for this was to bring the
combat closer and to make it much more
about kind of outmaneuvering your
opponent so if you can get the edge on
your opponent and you're trying to do
this and that will run each other
there's going to be key moments in this
where you get an advantage and you can
use the distinct weapons you've chosen
um you know your special Loadout you've
chosen and those things will be an
advantage but also be the disadvantages
too but
we want it to be about those moments
where you where you really engage in
combat and it becomes about maneuvering
your opponent rather than this kind of
slingshot kind of nurse on Nurse combat
we've kind of been used to and so we're
doing this by introducing
what Master modes are basically two
different operational States for the for
the vehicle uh Yogi why don't you tell
us what the two operational states are
what are the two Master modes so the one
state is um basically your your combat
mode
um we're still like uh talking about
whether it's should be like standard
control mode or actual just combat mode
and this is the mode which you do the
majority of your gameplay and like you
you're gonna do um yeah all the combat
stuff you're gonna you're probably gonna
do mining in that as well
um and the other mode uh which you swap
your ship into is it was called qcm in
our in our presentation uh recently we
just we're gonna just gonna call it nav
mode because it's more it's it's more
descriptive
um
name for it
um and this one allows you to use your
Quantum mode and it allows you to unlock
the high velocities but it makes such a
very very vulnerable in terms of like
there won't be Shields or weapons
working during that time and basically
that is the idea to watch which just
eluded like we're swapping what we're
separating these two gameplay systems
apart from each other so you can either
choose to be like high performant and
dangerous or you can be fast right and
uh travel and navigate around the verse
but you can't do it both at the same
time
so that's where that's where we are
currently right now in the Squadron 42
Branch but
like you mentioned before that we've
known about this issue for a while we
identified this issue you know a while
back folks who have been watching our
broadcast and seeing you on your shows
over the years are very familiar with
hearing this refrain that we got to fix
speed
um what are some of the things that we
tried before this that didn't work like
like take me on a journey what were the
other things we tried to fix before we
got to master modes
um so we tried like nothing Things based
upon the speed of the ship so we tried
some super Shields I think at the time
um
and just trying to make the tuning work
as well it's like you know we looked at
what we needed to get from the ships as
well and we just couldn't nothing really
felt great in what we were trying to do
it just felt like we were solving one
problem over here but it was creating
another problem over here and and that's
and that's the real difficulty with this
problem was
we had to come up with something what
I'm gonna say I solved everything but it
solved a majority issues without really
causing another problem which was the
the kind of loop we got into before
we're changing the way the shields work
and the weapon and stuff we just you
know we were always creating another
problem with what we were trying to
solve and that's something we really you
know we you know we definitely think
we've avoided with
um you know the master mode I saw
somebody I saw a comment on Reddit uh
just a day or two ago about somebody was
saying that Master modes aren't even in
Squadron 42 yeah they're not actively in
testing they are in Squad driver too
they are actively in testing they are
working now yes yes and we'll be testing
this for months now
um so it's been actively in the game and
we've been play testing ourselves on our
own team but we've also been testing
whether with
um you know we've you know we've also
been pronounced it you know to the
general Studio as well
um so we've definitely been in a really
good feedback loop and
um we're kind of really excited about
that because the internal results for us
have been really good and really
positive just so folks can get a
timeline in their heads you know for
other folks who who make their streams
and their videos anything about how long
ago did Master modes how long ago did
the idea for master modes happen
I think we're talking a good year and a
half ago
um I think it was
we started to really kind of realize
we're in that kind of loop of problems
and we need a way out of that problem
so then we started discussing what can
we do
um you know the the basic other ideas
were like well let's just let's just not
go very quick but then it's like well we
stop the ATP travel being fun and the
speed being fun because the speed is fun
it's really important for the general
game it's really important for racing as
well that ships can go quickly because
racing needs to feel like a challenge
um so we started kind of just sitting
down and going right you know how you
know how we're going to make this work
because we've got this problem
if we limit speeds we've got this
problem what's the overarching solution
to this
um so you said a year year and a half
ago was this a eureka-like moment is
this one of those things where somebody
was just in a meeting and they're like
holy crap I got it or was this a a
contested issue it was was everybody on
board at first or how did this come
about walk me through the history of
this what was this like when this was
coming up
um
it was interesting because we were never
going to be able to stop the speed the
high speeds in the game so we knew we
had that problem and I would say it was
a sort of Eureka moment
but also
we faced some challenges trying to get
this through as well so it's kind of
like yes it's a really cool idea oh but
you know we've got these problems to
solve
so
what was the problem I mean well you had
a problem getting Master modes into the
game approved is that what you're saying
here yeah it was more like just because
it's such a major change to the game we
had to convince people it wasn't gonna
break racing it wasn't going to break
man it was going to break all the other
systems we had from the game because
it's so fundamental to the way ships
work because it you know because you
were because we literally saying we've
got a combat mode where these systems
work you know we've got navigation mode
where these systems work and it's such a
fundamental change to the game it had to
be approved by so many people
um you know which is never easy you know
because everyone is trying to look after
their features which is the right thing
to do so we you know it was definitely a
challenge trying to convince other teams
as well that
this is going to be the best solution
for everyone for the game they have to
imagine a part of the reason why it's
not immediately into the persistent
Universe because it has to go through
all this testing with all these other
gameplay features you're talking about
yeah so is it so it's so it's quite a
challenging for you to develop because
one is going to Squadron first so it's a
single player Focus first and um in
terms of getting this through but we've
also had to help but also to move to the
Pu it needs to be fully to develop for
the multiplayer and also due to the
um you know and also due to the
resources we have to
in there we are depending on the dam
streams as well
um and because of the Squadron Focus
the damage teams have been prioritized
and it's where this fits within that as
well
uh what's the testing been like Yogi
testing well
so
um as Richard said there was like no no
Eureka moment right like usually when we
develop like stuff like that we're going
step by step in our intuitive processes
um it was easy to identify uh that slow
speed combat works a lot better
um simply by limiting the velocities
ourselves right like suddenly like the
geometry and so on looked a lot better
um so so when you say testing it
actually covers quite a lot of time from
or from like like checking what do we do
with the with the velocities but how do
we how do we actually limit the
velocities when when you when you go um
above boost and so on right because what
never felt good was for example just
boosting to your maximum uh sem velocity
and then being stuck there being stuck
in that in that maximum velocity in all
directions was one of the problems why
combat felt stale right because you
couldn't just uh
um like like it doesn't allow you any
more interesting any interesting tactics
so um and so we slowly went and like
adding stuff like the uh like the post
boost
um or the above sem boost boundaries and
all that making sure that the Boost is
applied in a non-spheric way but uh it's
more actually more x-shaped so you you
basically when you go when you boost
backwards you burn a lot more energy
than then you go forward which just uh
well which just forces you to you know
go to your Target and turn around and
and all these things like like we just
went through step by step I mean we it's
not like we're like uh living under
rocker so like we read and and watch
YouTube videos of like so many backers
uh or players I should say
um and and there's like hours and hours
of like a dog fighting analysis and like
we look for it all and like a lot of
these points were actually true so
um so we kind of like built our
requirement list out of that and then we
just try to go there step by step and um
testing is basically we have
um
we have testing slots every week
um sometimes like last two weeks were
horrible in this regard because the
bills were just like crashing on some
other on some other parts
um but I mean this this happens but we
just test the game every week with uh
with our pet friends so that's like
Bayer's team
um and then we just went to went to
there and we knew we were on the right
track when um at some point we were like
it was like a couple of months ago we
were like just just fighting with Master
mods around and um uh one one of the PT
guys was critical about one one specific
aspect wasn't really important right and
then I was a little bit insecure just
asked yeah but but do you like the
master mode system in general they were
oh yes yes of course we like it yeah
yeah right so this gives us like enough
confidence to know that we're on the
right track and like the process itself
with the testing works right we just
like slowly slowly go step by step to
the to the solution that we would like
to see
so
that that's some background that that's
somehow we got here let's just dive into
some of the specifics about stuff
um since the presentation folks have had
a lot of questions we've seen tons of
questions in Spectrum uh and those
YouTube videos and the twitch streams
that Yogi was just talking about we've
seen this come up in conversations and
stuff
um so one of the big ones that I've seen
is the switch between the modes
themselves
um because it can't be too easy if you
switch back and forth on a dime there's
no reason to have the two the part of
what makes the two Dynamic is this
transition between them so let's talk
about that transition how long are we
talking is the length of time dependent
on different ships or different ship
types and is the length of time
something that can be one day adjusted
through the use of components and tuning
and stuff what what are we thinking here
yeah so yeah so um there is a time
difference
um it is based but it can also be
component based as well because you've
got the shields going up and down
um because we didn't want
you just press a button Doom gun and
you're just in different modes because
we want the player to make that key
Choice when they're in
the
well you know when you're in the master
mode for combat for example we want them
to be in that camera because they want
to do that thing that they've chosen to
do but there's consequences to that and
it's the same belief in our flight
navigation mode without the shield
there's a choice for that that you can
go fast and you're just doing your A2B
stuff assassins you don't want to get
involved in combat so there is that
consequence of we can't just press a
button in its instant
um so you know so if you go from combat
mode for example navigation mode your
Shields will have to go down and then to
go back you Shields will have to go back
up but it's not an instant thing and it
will vary depending on the uh and and um
you know it will variably depend on the
components as well
um but they had so much tactical choice
though it's it's now now during fights
uh or during attacks you're being raided
by a pirate or whatever you it's not
just oh flip a motor and get out you
have to just you have to you have to
determine when the best time is going to
be you have to know your ship and
precisely how long it's going to take
your ship versus their ship to to make
these switches uh and then it opens up
the door for tons of customization with
the ships between the different
components and the tunings and such so
that you know we like the you know there
are many like it but this one is mine
it's going to allow people to to
fine-tune their ships and have a reason
to do so yes yeah I mean you know and
you know and that's the great thing
about this is it it gives the play
Choice that's you know something we're
really Keen for is is like we you know
as we prefer the underlying system
but we provide the choices within that
as well and that's really key for us you
know as a gameplay team is players have
those choices you know because people
play the game for all kinds of different
reasons there's some people like to go
out there but all you know you know with
you know you know
um Egon displays for example
and they can do that but if they do that
the other players are going to know that
they're in that mode and they're all
guns blazing so it's a disadvantage to
that because they're gonna be more aware
that that person's in that mode
um do we do we know what happens if you
switch modes at super high speeds like
if you're if you're if you're in nav
mode and you're you're traveling at the
fastest speed possible and then you
suddenly switch over so you slow down
very aggressively in your face almost
comes off
promise expand Style
yeah but you know it can be a very
aggressive deal and the um well it can
be very aggressive slow down from that M
Speed you know and that's another thing
you know that's going to be a critical
choice if you have to do that high speed
there's gonna be a reason that you've
done that
um but there's gonna be a consequence to
it I think uh it's actually quite quite
interesting because like when we when we
tested that first
um the decelerations we got were like up
to like
50 60 G something like that right so
that's obviously nothing that you can
survive easily right
um but we didn't see this effect because
our GeForce tuning doesn't react to like
uh decelerations that are taking that
short amount of time so basically
nothing happened but what we actually
want to achieve is like when you do an
an unhealthy like if you if you flip the
switch too fast and uh maybe even like
uh take into account that you might have
like ice algae's right then this this is
supposed to like knock you out right
um but that specific part is not is not
in but it is planned so that you need to
prepare when you actually want to slow
down so you kind of just like single
like click a flip and then flop back to
sem or so it there will be there will be
a consequences for that well again
that's part of the reason for the you
know switch to Dev focus on Squadron 42
the idea is you can Hammer these things
out and you can develop these further
there and then when they make their way
to the Pu whenever that is you know
they'll hopefully they'll have things
like what you were just talking about
um
I want to ask about racing because
there's been a there's been a rather
renewed focus on racing you know we had
we added the snake pit in the last patch
in 318 we've got six brand new community
uh race tracks that are being added
we've got the new timers in the in the
in the UI and the gateways
um folks who uh who follow the public
roadmap shout out to Jake uh know that
there are changes and improvements to
Arena Commander especially the racing
coming there so there's there's a lot of
new racing stuff coming in in uh Star
Citizen
nav mode like let's ask a question
would are we considering or would we
consider a third Master mode
specifically for racing something that
would get us the speed and the
maneuverability without any of the
weapons the shields stuff like that
because it doesn't seem like I don't
know if either one of these ones that
we're talking about seemed totally ideal
for racing but maybe that's just me I
don't know
um
that's a good point so it actually came
up in um so
um so um you know um you actually
commitment about
um basically from one of our play tests
you know is what you know what happens
to racing because
the speeds that we were hitting for well
the well um the actual space of combat
were probably just not enough to make
racing feel exciting so and then it's
actually had like a fundamental impact
on the choices we've made with the
design for master modes is to make sure
that racing works so we've got
boost now which works outside of the
actual combat mode um it might work a
little bit differently but we're going
to have Boost outside of the combat mode
now and that's and that's come
specifically from racing and the needs
of racing you know because I say you
know we're building lots of different
you know Wells now where you know race
as possible are actually doing you know
a lot more support for it and now to
build it you know officially within the
game because it's come from the
community you know they're the ones
making all these interesting levels out
the wells that we build you know and now
we're going right we're going to start
making this you know as part of the
actual game you know so we have to
support this and one you know um part of
this
big process of Master merge was the
rules and we want the racing ships to be
well relationships you know
you know so they're going to be very you
know they're going to go very quickly
still it's going to be light it's going
to be agile
but you're not really going to want to
do a combat you need a couple more
weapons you're probably not going to
really want to take them in combat but
they're gonna make me but to balance for
it is making sure the quick enough to
escape but there's still at risks there
in combat right so we might get some of
what I'm talking about through
components and tunings for racing
specific ships yeah so right and then
the Boost changes yes okay there's a bit
more to it though right um because like
one of the things
um so the the sem mode is supposed was
supposed or is supposed to be the high
uh the high performance mode that we're
in that you're in but like racing
doesn't doesn't work well when the when
the velocities are too too too low
um and they're actually like uh some
sequences uh from from from the
squadron's team as well and where they
want like racing like like structures
right so so we are looking at this very
deeply
um the thing that might probably change
or what we're currently testing if there
is whether or not the capacitor systems
have a little bit of a different Power
output so where you can for example
regenerate at your Boost pool in sem
within you know maybe 10 seconds or
whatever right it will take considerably
longer when you are in uh in in the nav
mode
um but it just like freeze really like a
lot of more potential to do fast racing
so you basically you you select you want
to go fast and have like you know uh
take care of your Boost pool or do you
want to like Risk going into into this
lower speed but then get rewarded with a
higher boost uh boost regeneration it
will be along these lines this is
currently in testing this is actually
the thing we wanted to check last week
which uh where the bills were busted so
uh well like no definitive answer how
that will look but we'll figure it out
it will just be part of the normal like
testing iteration yeah I imagine that
the challenge is still going to be the
same though that you know the more speed
tools you put in the sem for racing
people are going to attempt to use them
during dog fighting and stuff so it's
that's why that's why I guess in my
brain it just it seems like oh there's
really a third Master mode for racing
and stuff like that but yeah I trust you
guys are the engineers and the designers
it's like that so so far so far we don't
don't see that this is necessary what
we're lucky we'll do is just like make
race a little bit more flaky compared to
like comparable bug Fighters because
right now for example the M50 and the Pu
is a really really good dockfighter this
is not intended right
um so there has there has to be some
downsides to that you cannot be like you
know we always have to balance like the
defense of offensive and Agility
requirements of every ship and you can't
have a ship which is good at everything
so um and then we'll we'll see how that
goes but I would expect that that like
the combat effectiveness of racers in
the future will will decrease not saying
they're useless but they will I mean
these are racist these are not like not
Brawlers right like okay
um so uh since we revealed Master modes
and citizen Khan you mentioned you're
watching the YouTube watching the the
Spectrum and stuff like that what kind
of feedback have you seen so far
um we did a lot both good
um but also there's like there's a lot
of questions you know and I think that's
the main thing is there's been a lot of
questions about how you know how does it
affect this how does it affect this you
know and what you're doing to
you know combat this problem which you
know the community you think is going to
happen because of combat modes
um
but we've been doing a lot of testing to
make sure that
we're not just fulfilled you know we
don't just fulfill our own prophecy of
going right we'll fix this
you know so the testing has also been
you know kind of outside of our little
rebate a little bit which is we don't
just want to reinforce our own ideas
we've you know we've played tested this
on the basis that what a place feeling
um you know when they actually you know
player Master modes
um so that's been a big focus of ours
um and I think it's gonna be difficult
to answer a lot of the questions
um until we start showing it working and
we actually show the results because
that's what we're really excited about
is we're excited about the results from
this and what we've seen internally has
been really positive
um you know things are much closer
and the difference which we want in the
systems both in terms of components and
the weapons on the ship and the style of
ship you have and making much more of a
difference in those Mo in like in those
key moments
um but that's just something that we're
just gonna have to prove out
um now again I can already see the the
response to what you just said is well
then put it into the Pu and let us see
it and let us you know experiment it's
going to stay in Squadron 42 for a while
um uh just you know so can you do all
the internal testing so that it can be
very focused we talked about it in the
DCC thing so you can you focus on these
specific ships and get these done before
you have to expand it to all of the
ships of the of the Pu yeah and that's
the big thing for us is this is a lot of
work
um so it's like releasing the to
releasing the Pu it's a massive feature
for us because it changes almost every
single component in the game it changes
every single ship in the game as well
from both
a ship performance perspective so to
make sure that ship is within its
performance window
um
but also it's Health as well
um and just how it behaves in the game
it does you know we've got
we have 100 ships now you can fly in the
game and that takes a lot of testing and
a lot of tuning to do so you know and
also we've got a lot of what the player
testing to do you know we've you know
we've got to make sure it looks correct
so the players understand the master
modes on the UI
um so there's a lot of work to bring
this feature together but you know we've
got the fundamental feature together
um in terms of you know s42 now it's in
there you can change all the speeds
um but that's not a very limited amount
of ships and on a very limited amount of
components right now so to get the Pu is
a lot more work because we don't just
want to release this
like work in progress and say right this
is on like five ships right now you know
go try it it's just not something we can
do because it's so fundamental to the
entire component structure we have in
the game and you just confirm that there
are only five ships in Squadron 42 no oh
come on no no no uh just to just to add
to this point right
um there are also heavy Downstream
dependencies because right now most of
the master mode UI for example is
beautiful Coda art and uh if you ever
so-called so-called saw Code art it's
not well it's very simplistic right and
it doesn't it's wonderful Yogi it
doesn't really that works amazing
it does respect the Aesthetics that uh
certain other people in the company
would like to see
um so we if we could like it's
functionally working right it's um but
it's it's it wouldn't be fun at the
moment in the Pu because a we only have
tuned a couple of ships for it and B
like most of the UI or of the of the
nice UI is missing so
um and there's a couple of other things
in the Pu as well which don't add up yet
well because for example um travel
distances we likely would need to travel
um or tune them slightly different for
squadrons versus rpu
um because on the Pu you're gonna visit
like you're gonna freely jump from
planets to planets that's not strictly
always given in the uh in the um in the
frame that Squadron skips you right
um so it will be a while until players
can can see it but when we're ready
we're not like uh like throwing it
probably right in we will try to test uh
in like within the evocati groups and so
on to um get feedback whether or not
it's work on the Pu and then do
adjustments before we before we release
it to the wider public right so it'll be
a while before it comes to the Pu we're
just about out of time we're going to
let you go and and move on to the next
half of the show but before we do any
last things you want to leave the Star
Citizen Community with any last words
you want to say
last niblets they can hang on to while
they wait
um we're really excited for this place
to get out you know I do a set of
frustration here and that's not going to
be immediately you know one of the next
releases but
it'll be worth it
um and I hope we can kind of you know
keep you know kind of really more ensure
more of the actual real world results of
this in the game for us because that's
you know because we're really excited
about it
it's just a fundamental amount of work
it's going to be is a lot
um but yeah you know and it yeah you
know yeah you know and also thanks for
support you know we do read
a lot of the feedback and we do watch a
lot of the videos and you know not just
the streamers but we watch a lot of
videos that people just share in the
game as well you know in a pleasure
having a great time you know so yeah we
do spend a lot of time watching that
stuff
uh oh I'm sorry one last question I
asked you this during the filming we've
been several months on I asked you the
simplest question like do we finally
have it do we really have it is this
really it I'm gonna ask you again as
your answer changed is this is this it
this is everything
all right all right so rich Yogi thank
you so much for taking your time to be

introduction but we're going to do it

cloud Imperium games uh way back when uh
Sandy Roberts Sandy how you doing

give you an e-hug
welcome back to the spaceship yes thank
you very much I'm happy that I can

spoilers so okay so the last time she
shows up last time she shows up but we
were still under construction listen and
and if you if you follow Sandy on on
Twitter or social or other social medias

presence there and she starts taking
pictures and I'm just like I'm just like
I know please please no picture not
before citizens
she was like fine but I have to come
back yes so now I'm back you invited me
back thank you very much fun so what are
you doing here you I mean normally
you're based out of the LA Studio that's
where we work together for for so many
years
um uh but you're known to travel a lot
in your position I am I travel a lot
Chris is here all the time so therefore
so what brings you here now what brings
me here now well what day is it today
it's uh whatever day it is yes uh the
other day we were we were at the
Frankfurt Christmas party okay and I got
to see the new offices which are really
nice really nice they did a really good
job
um I don't know a lot of people
so there are all there are a lot of news
there are a lot of new faces you know we
we talk about this how the company has
grown to like 800 plus folks and it's
impossible to keep up with all of the
new faces I I come in and I'm just like
yeah I I did not know yeah of course
Inez Brian Chambers uh hanas
um who else was there oh Todd moved here
but but a few faces uh said hello but
wonderful offices Christmas party was
great and then we went to a bar citizen
yeah my brain is yes we flew to Berlin
which was fantastic I I think you sent
you think you loaded Tom up with a
picture before do we have a picture of
the bar citizen in Berlin
oh wow that's a big one
it was it was a big one we had
um we capped it just over a hundred
people so that we were able to talk to
everybody okay right we took everybody's
hand I waved but he shook everyone's
hand and then we sat at each table we
did a q a
um we signed lots of stuff took lots of
pictures that's really good fun for
those who may not be familiar with bar
citizens are a wonderful initiative
started by our own Community uh to
basically gather and break bread and
tell tales with uh with other star
citizens and then because we'd like hey
that's pretty cool you know we if
they're local to an office we would
crash over the years uh recently this
year we started the bar citizen World
Tour where we would send cig staff and
developers to all manner of places uh
you know cities states provinces
different countries around the world on
different continents uh you've been to
you've been to a few of those how's that
been the bar citizens World Tour I have
well this was actually the first one
I've been to in a while okay the
original one I don't know if you went to
the original one but it was created by
myself and Alexis and Ben
and that was in 2013 I believe in Santa
Monica
and uh that was good fun and that took
off we did food citizen you came to that
one
that was a that was a a failure
sometimes we try things yeah sometimes
we try and they don't work and
um but I haven't been to a bar City well
actually I went to the one in Los
Angeles it was sort of in the summer in
the South as I say I knew you this
hadn't been the first thing I've ever
had in the first one also yes so that
was the first one I'd been since the
pandemic and I saw a lot of La folks I
didn't recognize too but a lot I did
recognize that's what happens when the
project grows I know I know I know it's
not it's not just me and Ben and Chris
and haddock and yeah yeah I want to go
back to the to the to the to the
Christmas to the holiday party a little
bit you said you were there with with
Brian Chambers
I heard that there's there's a photo of
Brian actually smiling yeah I didn't
know that was a thing but but we were
posing and I guess uh well posing for
the camera and I guess Brian wasn't
smiling
smile smile smile so and and you sent
that to Tom too Tom do we have that I
haven't seen this yet
a smiling Brian Chambers wow yes well
Aaron was smiling because it was snowing
they brought the snow for us and uh
Aaron had been outside drinking the glue
Vine so he was quite happily smiling but
um and then somebody told me that the
secret to drinking gluvine is to eat the
almonds
then you don't get some like a furry
throat
so
I don't know that was a pro tip it may
or may not work I didn't try it but uh
uh anybody who chooses to take that
advice and uh whether it works or not uh
we endemnify cloud and pyramid games
rubber Space Industries exactly we take
no responses
they can attempt such a thing but maybe
it works yeah all right so so on your
way here you pass through Frankfurt you
pass through Berlin yes now you're here
though now I am here so what brings you
here what brings me here again is the
new offices and also a board meeting I'm
on the board
um so that's that big quarterly
Gathering where I see all the important
people come by and they're just like you
can't stay in the other room and I'm
like okay I'll stay away don't scare the
board members yeah of course my
daughters joke that it's called bored
for a reason but
um so if that's why I'm here so that's
the big quarterly thing that happens and
it's it's here in the Manchester office
it's here yeah
um now we haven't you talked about the
Frankfurt office The Venture service we
haven't really shown any of this uh of
this yet because you know we want to
wait till it's totally dialed in and
everything and all the amazing wall art
is up and everything but uh because
because you've been and I haven't give
me your impression of the Frankfurt
office what what is it real is it really
I've seen photos of these weird pod
things that you can sit in they look
weird but they're not weird I I sat in
one and they're they're like sound
proofed little very comfortable meeting
rooms
and you you sit you can sit with
somebody and take a meeting I went into
the meditation room
uh and took a nap
they have these sort of banana boat uh
cushions but you can also do other you
know it's relaxation room play music do
all kinds of things and I saw on uh you
again we're in reference for Twitter I
saw on your Twitter yesterday uh you
took a picture of Benoit in the the new
sim pod uh Sim rig that we had that we
built here in Manchester that's really
impressive that you built it well no
Benoit no we uh I stood around and made
snide comments while he built it but oh
but that was impressive because I feel
like I just saw him in Frankfurt yeah he
did it in a day he did it in a day yeah
oh wow it's Benoit yeah of course of
course I saw that I saw the guys having
a having a try I wasn't I wasn't too
game to have a try there's so much going
on
I was just always afraid I was going to
kick the pieces and lose them so
we have you here I know we've been you
know catching up and stuff like this but
it is our 10th anniversary this year
um
I'm a sucker for the history and stuff
when when folks have a question here
about something from yay old days they
usually come to me and ask because I've
been here for as long as I have now
you're one of the few people that have
more tribal knowledge than I do you know
we're back I want to ask you about that
first day because this is a conversation
we've never had the first the first day
the first day you know October 10th 2012
you're at GDC in Texas I don't as in
Austin
what was that day like because because
you know you and Chris and ortwin and
and like I said a small handful you know
haddock and stuff have been working
internally it's all been a secret at
this point uh you had the contest thing
over but it's all been a secret and this
is the day you're finally gonna unveil
this to the world what was that like
tell me a story yeah I mean you know I
was talking to John Erskine in Frankfurt
at the Frankfurt Christmas party and and
we were saying when you're really doing
it when you're really in it
it's just so
there's you're just on on high alert
it's it's like the lead up to the
October 10th there was so many
balls to catch and plates and spinning
in the air
um
that I mean we just didn't know we
thought it was going to go well but we
weren't sure
um I think did I tell you Chris was
singing like Chris is not a great singer
but he called me from Germany spoiler
alert
um he called me from Germany and you
know that song Big in Japan that he was
singing big in Germany badly because all
the journalists had brought old Wing
Commander boxes and they were raving
about the Prototype and he thought well
maybe we have something maybe it's going
to be good right because Sean Tracy
Hannah's they all thought it was good
and I'd seen the Prototype I thought
this this is something but you never
know
and uh we set up the website and I was
doing everything at the time I mean
everything
um that was his personal assistant a
meeting organizer dealing with publicity
the marketing department yeah everything
I booked Chris into a broom closet in
London we're on a budget
um and of course when he got up to give
the the speech at GDC in the
presentation and then we launched the
site it crashes
well and in what would become the
Hallmark of Star Citizen for a few years
yeah I just was like oh my gosh
it was
in that moment I thought oh my gosh it's
over it's so done
um you can laugh out laugh at it now but
I I imagine in it on day one it was hot
it was horrifying it was all that work
and then you're thinking oh my gosh and
you're thinking people are going to go
away and not come back because the
world's so fast and fickle
um
but yeah the first one and then it just
sort of snowballed from there
it kept going
so we we have a you say snowballed from
there uh I've got a couple I've got a
couple of stats here I want to see if I
can if I can pull this out from the chat
so I mean we we now of course we've
talked about how the company we were
mentioned the company has blown up to
five studios around the world 800 you
know employ 800 plus employees uh I know
there's I think I had a number here
about how many uh star citizens we have
but there was over 36 million hours
played in 2022 alone not not over our
life from 36 million hours played in
just this calendar year the one that
we're still not done with and it
averages to something like between the
players and the things that's an average
of three hours of play time
is it a day
we're at 44 million oh okay come on
there's there's literally I was reading
the old message and they're like no it's
changed uh so so three hours a day uh uh
at 44 million hours played this year so
far so yeah it's it's you know not bad
for a game that this vaporware
I know I know I've played it with the
girls
are we not supposed to say that you're
trolling yourself yeah yeah
but I was telling one specific person on
Reddit uh I see I say
um yeah I play with the girls I I'm I'm
not that great they always they're so
good I'm terrible I I yeah I do all the
dumb things and they then Mom you don't
do that you got to take your helmet off
before you eat a hot dog
I mean they're just you know of course
one of the one of the dirty secrets we
don't talk about is that very rarely are
the people who make a game really really
good at the game that they make I think
there's this weird expectation that if
you that if you're involved in the
creation of a game that you must be this
excellent player at it but I've seen
more people you know not just I'm not
talking about Star City specifically I'm
talking about any of the places I work
blizzard whatever it's it's you spend
all this time making it and then you
actually sit down and try to play it and
it's like they're different aptitudes
they're dramatically different aptitudes
so yeah I I was I was hopeful I I when I
got into uh that Sim rig that Benoit uh
built I I completed my first race at New
Horizon Speedway ever
look at you not really impressive oh I
guess it depends how how you did it too
ah so yeah so so so so so so we were we
were also so what would you I think
you'd be referred to you as what would
you call yourself you were you're there
you're part of the the OG group uh we
were having this conversation is this
Original Gangster oh gee what did you
call that the Old Guard the Old Guard
yeah the original guard yeah
I don't know but but yeah those those
early days of of setting this place up
uh I mean world record you know right
off the bat not too shabby not too
shabby for a you know for a team of only
a handful of people back then
yes
I mean
so busy I used to answer customer
service tickets too I remember yeah I
was I was talking to Tyler about that in
the live stream I gave people my
personal email on facts on Thanksgiving
and got two and a half thousand tickets
definitely the worst leak any of us here
in this building have ever been a part
of yeah
so uh we you know organized the citizen
cons the first one we didn't even have
our own let's talk about the first
season the very first season on 2013
that was in Austin that was in Austin at
the Alamo and then the after party again
I was on a budget because we really
didn't spend marketing
it was a lot of community and a lot of
just putting it together
yeah so there was nobody there like we
didn't have our own venue we were
sharing it with some Finance guys who
were like well what Star Citizen and of
course we had some some backers there
and so the person is half video game
players and yeah half accountants yeah
it was a interesting party
so yeah the first one and then we had a
couple in um
why do we have the other ones oh the
Manchester one with the Concorde plan
yeah yeah the Concord plane that oh my
gosh so so that was my that was not my
first one but you know first one in when
I was inside and I'm I'm there I'm
monitoring a chat remember chat roll who
remember anybody yeah I remember Cheryl
and watching watching people go crazy
they built an enormous spaceship
Court
but it was already there yeah but yeah
no it's this isn't going to start as
obviously started very small you know it
has grown uh commiserate with the
project uh all the way till 2019 which
was our our biggest one yet here in here
in Manchester look at this the um
I'm just gonna do I'm just going to do
it so that was our last one that we've
done live that was 2019. uh obviously we
didn't have one in 2020 it was the
pandemic we had originally had one
scheduled that year for Los Angeles uh
that you know but the city shut down uh
in 2021 and 2022 we had virtual events
uh internally we call it digital system
which is why I said DCC twice in the
thing in case people were like what is
he's talking about DC it was an internal
sorry it's an acronym it's not one that
you're meant to hear but I said it twice
and I figured I'll explain it
um
it's been four years
you know since well well it will be next
year next year it will have been four
years since we had a live event is there
anything you can tell us any Sunshine
any hope any yeah but you're like
setting me up well I figured I figure
that they can't get mad at me if you say
if I say something you say something if
I say something well there is something
happening in my hometown not Hometown I
mean where do I live really but
Los Angeles Los Angeles yes we are going
to go back into a physical citizen con
yes
you know next year next year 2023 yes
uh anything like a date any day eight
dates oh you see I'm not Chris but soon
TM no
um in October
but I don't know when in October but we
will do a physical citizen Con in Los
Angeles in 2023 in October
yes all willing and the world doesn't
explode or Los Angeles decides to do
something really weird yeah no I'm gonna
I'm gonna do some space dead here for
this just okay so hi everybody uh you
just heard that citizen con 2023 has
been confirmed for Los Angeles in
October of 2023.
there are probably going to be some of
you who want to rush out and buy plane
tickets and book hotels and such like
this I'm going to ask that you hold on
that you that that you remain calm and
stuff like this we don't know if this is
going to be the beginning of October the
end of October remember the last
physical citizen we had was in November
these things are not entirely within our
control there's the venue and when what
what venues are available and when they
have schedules and then you know all the
different third party vendors that we
have to hire in order to put on a big
thing so without
knowing that we are shooting for October
but if it ends up being November 3rd or
it ends up being September 30th or
something I would just encourage you to
please
hang tight don't book any plaintiffs
unless you want to spend a month and a
half in La which I can recommend you go
to Disney World you've got a lot you
know Universal there's lots of things to
do but
hang tight this is this is more than I
expected to get uh today so so uh so
yeah that's that's exciting though I'm
yeah what we are doing bar citizens
again I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure
that the world tour is kicking off again
in January that too is that a spoiler
alert
am I just
okay so so the bar citizen World Tour
2022 as we've been calling it yeah is
going to continue next year I think so I
I heard a rumor that uh the one that
Chris and I went to was the last one for
2022 but we're kicking off in January
the 2023 tour
all right so we're kicking off our
citizen World Tour 2023 yes
um and then Chris and I we're you know
we'll try to make it to a couple here
and there I'm not sure which ones but
all right all right I'm I'm a space dad
again uh uh okay yeah don't go booking
every single exactly so uh The Wave Bar
citizen world tour works uh you guys
decide uh where to have them you can go
to barcitizen.sc uh you can announce
your bar citizen uh you you can
coordinate your own and be sure you let
us know uh tag us on social media submit
uh tickets whatever your communication
method of choices uh but remember that
while we would love to attend each and
everyone that simply is not a logistical
a possibility so uh so let us know try
to give us as much time and notice as
possible uh don't be like hey I'm doing
a bar citizen next Thursday and you know
in Spain can you make it try to give us
as much time as possible and remember to
work with your event with your venues
remember to let the venues know uh when
you're playing them and everything so
that everything is nice and copacetic
and everything so that when we fly
people over everything works and
everything is awesome uh but yeah bar
