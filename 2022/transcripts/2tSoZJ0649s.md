hello everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live engine and graphics q a i'm
your host jared huckabee uh welcome once
again back to my half ikea half still
unpacked luggage uh a home office
uh i'm jared huckabee uh creative
content lead for cladded brain games
robert space industries and if you've
never seen star citizen live before it's
where we take about an hour out of our
uh a week and uh chat with some
developers uh usually about their work
usually about the stuff that they're
they're working on or the stuff that
they're about to work on or the stuff
that they've worked on in the past that
people still have questions and and
stuff about uh joining us on the show
this week is a
uh uh is a menagerie of engine and
graphics uh programmers
directors and
and sorts so let's uh let's take a few
moments as we usually do and introduce
our our codery of developers this week
starting uh to my immediate right with
the lovely blue gradient background
jonas who are you and what do you do for
star citizen
oh hi i'm jonas i'm starting i'm working
for star citizen since
one and a half years roughly
and i was mainly doing co-engine work
like doing profiling tools or internal
stuff
one of the
fruits of that you could likely see in
the last patch with the performance
improvement
we found that due to the new profiling
tools or improved profiling tools
and i'm also supporting on the john 12
work to get that done
are you taking credit for all the
performance improvements of the last
match
no of course not that's likely
something for body to take credit
all right uh sylvan who are you and what
do you do for star citizen
yeah hi everyone so i'm sullivan i
joined cig three years ago
um i am an engine program as well um
mainly i do graphics work and helping
the graphics team
um specifically gen 12 and yeah in the
future most likely vulcan as well and
usually i do all sorts of things like
wherever i'm needed i'll just jump in
and you know
fix box or whatever
it's required well i'm there
fair enough and a man who probably needs
no introduction but we're going to do
whatever you want anyway because every
show is somebody's first show mr ali
brown who are you and what do you do for
star citizen
hey
i'm ali brown i'm the director of
graphics engineering uh
so cover the graphics department and the
vfx programming department and then work
very closely with the guys in the engine
department in frankfurt
and i've
been here since the beginning pretty
much
yeah you have you you're one of the
you get you got to be close to your 10
year at this point right
i think the uk studio has been going
eight and a half last movie yeah all
right
so uh today's show uh is
plainly labeled as engine and graphics a
q a uh we we have we're basically going
to answer questions related to
uh uh
engineering graphics engineering
gen 12 renderer all that you know ray
tracing all that good stuff
as usual you can submit your questions
live in the chat during the show by
prefacing your question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets and we spent the week
collecting questions as we usually do
letting you guys vote up which ones you
want to see uh answered most and then
going through there stripping the ones
that you guys voted up that were still
off topic for this group and then
finding the ones that were actually
appropriate for our our esteemed
colleagues today so we're going to start
writing with that um
i think the biggest topic for anything
engine and graphics is probably gen 12
vulcan stuff so we'll just we'll jump
into the uh
the more heavily traffic stuff um
this question says uh
what are the differences between gen 12
and vulcan and how are they related to
get more optimization in the game
uh yeah that's probably a question for
me
um
probably the best question to start with
since um yeah i'm working on it pretty
much full time
and for the people who still don't know
what the difference is
there i mean that's pretty much
um like we've already published a lot of
videos about it and
other people talked about it but gen 12
is basically our
internal
engine structure rendering architecture
for how rendering works and vulkan is
the underlying graphics api which
one day hopefully gonna not hopefully
but which which one day replaces um the
directx um
graphics api
and yeah vulcan
the
the
benefit of vulkan is
pretty much
performance it scales much better on
multiple
cpus and threats
so
well
yeah performance we all have performance
and we all seen what it can do in 3.17
so
yeah if everything goes to plan we'll
it performance will get even better the
coming patches so i'm very excited for
that especially after we shipped one of
our first milestones in 3.17 about gen12
and yeah i'm working hard on it to
get it done
what was that milestone that just
shipped in 317
um so gen12 is so you can kind of split
it up in two parts like all the
scene rendering like all the objects you
see on screen and then all the other
rendering stuff like post-processing and
compute passes
and
pretty much everything else
and the scene rendering is
especially difficult
to what's especially especially
difficult to do because we have like
hundreds of shaders and thousands of
shader permutations and
thousands of materials and
we need to make sure that everything
works um exactly as a legacy rendering
as the legacy renderer
and yeah we have a lot of issues and
edge cases which you don't see during
development so just once you submit your
code and it crashes somewhere and then
you just take a look and see oh
okay that's what happens okay i forgot
this too i forgot to add this so
i'm gonna add this edge case
um
yeah and so the first milestone was
getting part of the scene rendering done
and for 3.17 that was the brushes the
brushes is what we call like all the
non-interactive static objects
you see in game this is
these are the brushes and yeah they're
going through 10 12
already and
and the next step would be um characters
ships like
um
like
yeah dynamic objects and the planets
didn't make it 3.17 as well though also
the um
objects on the planet they made it in
3.17 as well with gen12 so happy about
that
um yeah so
once we have that um
gen 12 is almost complete we still need
to do all the transparent objects which
is still a huge task to to tackle but
yeah we started on that and i'm very
optimistic
uh
i i i know you
we we we've hit the uh the performance
uh thing you know kind of hard there are
there benefits to
uh the switch to a gen 12 renderer that
aren't
uh performance related i mean do do we
get does
does does the action does the quality of
the render
improve does i mean are there better
visuals all around or is this strictly
just a performance improvement kind of
thing um gin 12 is strictly just
performance but of course audio also
mentioned that in previous talks
pretty much it
gives us more room for more fancy stuff
and
like we can use all the new fancy
features and vulcan like rage racing and
what else there is so
not just performance
has that battle work ally that you you
get all these performance improvements
and then you start
adding more
uh more and more features and more and
more uh uh uh visual elements and that
start taking up those performance gains
that you just that you just made for
yourself how do you how how do you
balance that
well ironically a lot of the new
technology we have isn't actually saves
you performance so it initially it might
even go the other way like it enables a
whole bunch of features
um
with things like the mesh shading and
the variable weight shading
and and sometimes not even technology
but more just like uh
not hardware technology but internal
like because we've restructured the
renderer we can now do certain things
much easier than we could before
so there's lots of opportunities now for
optimizations that we may not have had
before
so it might actually be like a double
win after this can implement uh
some improvements and there's those
features that i know that there's
questions about later about the lss or
fsr and these type of technologies which
were
were type of problematic to implement
halfway through you know when we're
doing the conversion to gen12 so then
they become on the table again once
we've settled on a single new renderer
so i don't think it's the end of the
performance improvements once we've uh
got to gen 12 but yeah there is also a
few that would go the other direction um
and and losers performance um
but
future battle we'll see how fast we can
make it first before we worry too much
about how much we'll slow it down in the
future um a big focus we want to do is
to make the engine scalable so hopefully
these any new shiny things we add can be
scaled up and down
uh ideally so that we don't have to you
know you can keep the game running on
the on the lower spec but
push it hard on the high spec
and completing gen 12 is just the first
step to a series of more optimizations
we already planned out so
expect much more to come
after yeah after 10 12
yeah we've
we've got it as a on the milestones as
if like gen 12 and vulcan are like you
know a concrete thing that is not done
and then one day is done
that's not quite true it's i mean it's
it's useful for scheduling to type of
make that type of appear true um but you
know that it's not as precise as that um
yeah this continuous set of features and
even vulcan you know that that will
introduce new performance um or it might
you know detriment forms in some ways
might improve performances somewhere and
as we learn more we'll be able to get
more performance out of vulcan so yeah
it won't just be uh
we're done and we never look at this
thing again
but the milestones were mentioned in a
type of are
a point of confidence when we think yeah
that's like 99 that's most of what we
were gonna the biggest chunk of work has
done
i think that's probably a perennial uh
concern with all aspects of star citizen
because this is the this is not just a
make it until one day and it's done kind
of thing that the development of star
citizen
goes it just continues it's like any
other mmo you're
continuously iterating and developing
stuff there is it's it's i think that i
understand
you know
having come from the community so long
ago this desire to
just put a bow on something and say it's
done uh it's just not the way
uh uh this project works it's this
project is constantly about pushing
those boundaries and seeing what's
possible and stuff it's been in our dna
since the beginning so it's uh it's
always a like everything it's a delicate
balance between between
not wanting to just lead people on
forever you know just you know but
also you know just reporting things
accurately and honestly and effectively
um
one of the questions here uh
is from somebody who's clearly looked at
our uh
uh i can't remember what it's called
right now i'm blaming the name the thing
that shows the
the
the performance for all of our players
and stuff that cool graph and i'm
blanking on the name it says i see many
folks with older graphics cards like the
970 and 1080 cards those 1080 cards are
really good though will those by chance
see an fps boost after gen 12 and vulcan
telemetry thank you people elementary
good think of the word
yeah we'll try to answer that answer
that so the goal of gen 12 in the first
place is to improve cpu performance
so in case you run an older
cpu with your old gpu you might see an
improvement because we better you can
better utilize all the cost of your cpu
but the more likely case is that your
bottleneck by the gpu
and then um gen 12 won't really bring a
benefit there
um
welcome might bring a benefit there but
you never know we have to have to
measure that it might bring benefits in
one case but there's a drawback in
another case that that's hard to tell
but uh especially when you when you're
rendering with uh in high resolution
when you are trying to do 4k
and then the older graphics cards
graphics cards will most likely be a
bottleneck anyway and and perform type
there
ali you and i were talking uh earlier in
the week about
common misconceptions
that that
gamers have just
where they come from not just for our
project for all gaming project like like
everybody like everybody's got 12
different things that they all call lag
you know and stuff like this uh
there's
there's this assumption that gen 12 and
vulcan it's like this are
video card related things and and as we
just discussed there they're actually
more cpu related oh
if you had to guess where that
misconception comes from
this isn't the show we're just going to
clear up a bunch of misconceptions but
i'm curious what you're thinking is on
on on why those things all often get
conflated into video card issues and not
cpu issues
yeah i mean
it's stupidly confusing um
we're working on a renderer and a
graphics api but somehow they don't make
the
the rendering or graphics any faster
um it makes no sense um
yeah but the reality is a lot of the
work is feeding this these uber powerful
type of processors we have these gpus
with work and it's hard to keep up like
to give them enough work um
and that's why it's it's a lot of effort
for the cpu to keep them fed and
these that's why like there's so much
work to do on the on the gen 12 and the
vulcan side these graphics apis and the
renderer um
but i mean
like we said earlier that gen 12 will
open doors to optimizations then
optimizations will and can benefit
the gpu but just the milestone we're
mainly focusing on is improving the cpu
performance because that has by far been
the biggest bottleneck for most players
um and that's why somebody with like a
3080 or 3090 might not be in the frames
they want um
so um yeah so for most people it's it is
the cpu bottleneck i mean the the range
between the cards mentioned there the
970 and 1080 is quite large uh the 1080
is going to be significantly faster
um
then obviously resolution like like
jonah said like is a big factor as well
um if you're running a 970 then
hopefully you're targeting 1080p and not
trying to push too much beyond that um
otherwise you will struggle
yeah but the um the i i can see there's
many reasons why things would be
confused in this area um
yeah i don't know
what we can do about that um
it is just confusing
i just embark on a crusade to re-educate
the entire games industry why not we got
time
um
as we're talking about performance here
this question says how come since the
gen 12 renderer was implemented my
performance actually dropped i get an
average of 13 to 17 17 fps no matter the
quality or resolution of the game
well it's easy to answer and
in fact so if um
whoever's watching so i posted like a
gen 12 update and progress like two
weeks ago on the spectrum
and initially like
i didn't even plan to do that because i
didn't expect any performance benefits
of gen 12 in 3.17
but
due to the uprising amounts of threats
and people talking about these magical
improvements in 3.17
and people were wondering where that
actually came from i felt like i had to
i had to give an update so uh yeah
that's what i did um the thing is gen 12
right now only the brushes um
[Music]
they're rendering in general
but
the big caveat is that
um
our rendering right now we're mostly
limited
due to the main thread and not the
render thread so they're like two
two threads and it goes very deep into
engineering i would already say so for
everyone who can't follow me right now
i'm sorry
[Music]
but basically that's like a render
threat which um as ali said previously
it's like
um this kind of
um thing feeding the work the rendering
work into the gpu and
that with the old legacy renderer is
really slow because constantly every
frame
um check every state and see what
objects we can render and trench 1012
uses a different approach by just
pre-baking the state
in like in a small object and then when
we render we just have the entire state
ready and can just say gpu here another
subject
so the render thread with i tested it
myself on the performance was like with
gen12 it's more than twice as fast
but if you're not limited by the render
threat
which was at least on my machine was
mostly the case
um like it doesn't give you anything
so
that's why i didn't expect any benefits
and didn't feel the need to give an
update but yeah
um
but in the future if with full gen 12
that's that's another thing right now
because we have this mixed mode we have
objects rendering with gen12 and other
objects going through the legacy path
and there is actually
a cost to that on the main thread which
is the bottleneck
which means or what i would have
expected gen 12 would have made it
actually a little bit slower
but
that didn't even happen so
i'm happy about that but once we can get
rid of all the legacy stuff and have
full chain 12 then we'll see the full
potential and i'm very excited about
that
your story is a very common one
throughout all of game development
it's one of the reasons quite honestly
that
most games don't do the level of
content and interaction that we do
anything because
if there's a reason it's called game
development not game construction we
don't always know how the thing is going
what the puzzle is going to look like
once we finish putting it together uh
and it's it's why when when
you know when folks ask questions about
how much gen 12 is going to improve
performance versus how much server
meshing is going to improve versus how
much you know object
you know container streaming is going to
stuff like this it's
it can often sound like our developers
are being cagey
and it's and and it's less about being
caging just want not wanting to over
promise
uh on on on something
it's it's because there's always these
pleasant surprises there's always the
we're doing this hoping that this will
do the thing we want it to do and if it
does then awesome and if it doesn't then
we're going to do something else trying
to hope it does the thing we do and if
that that does great and if it doesn't
we're going to do something else to try
it's it never
you don't ever you don't ever give up
you know not on a project like this
anyway maybe on some other ones uh i've
worked for but
it's it's it's
it's it's hard to make these
it's hard to always speak in these
definitive things ahead of time because
a lot of this is being discovered along
the way when uh when you're building
something that's never been built before
how do you say how fast it's going to be
or or how precise it's going to be and
stuff
so it's a
it's one of the combination
best things and sometimes worse things
about
working on a project of this size scale
scope
and
openness
let's see if we've got a couple more gen
12 vulcan stuff here we'll just keep
them all grouped together
here's the forever question
uh linux support linux support after
vulcan integration is this still planned
well i i can give a short update on that
as well
um so
for the people who don't know um only
works on windows
and vulkan is um created by the chronos
group which also created opengl so this
is like a different opengl is like more
an old graphics api and vulkan is like
the new modern graphics api
and
these kind of graphics apis they also
run on various other operating systems
and yeah vulcan is
like known to run on windows and on
linux and even on apple with an
additional wrapper it's called molten os
i believe molten vk that's the name
um
so and
christopher balti like he's very keen on
on the linux port and
so it's up
top on his priority list so
all i believe one day we'll see linux
port
uh the other thing i'd add is um this
isn't firsthand knowledge but
second or third has knowledge but the um
people can already run it
using the uh the various layers you got
called proton and wine on linux they can
run the game now i think there's a there
was an issue with the easy enter cheat
type of uh blocking that i don't know if
that's been resolved yet but the um that
was on uh epic i believe to resolve that
but um that does work but going through
these layers that emulate windows has a
major performance cost
um apparently it's playable some people
say but um the use of vulkan i've been
told
allows it to skip that layer that it has
to apply to translate direct text into
something usable
so even if we just had vulcan and did
implement native support for linux
we would still get much better
performance on the rendering by using
these layers because it wouldn't have to
emulate directx anymore um it would just
have to emulate what the other there's a
you know any other windows calls or with
the input and the sound and things like
this but obviously the graphics tends to
be a huge processor hog
so
uh that not have to do a translation uh
between windows code and limited code uh
we'll save quite a lot there we're
hoping so it makes that boot more viable
until we get a an actual official you
know pure linux native linux client i
know
i think the
the folks who had it running on mac i
think that ended with when they switched
to the m1 like you still do it on the
old intel
machines i think the m1s in one switch
they did
um i'm still waiting for the voodoo
3dfx port
personally
uh thanks jackaroshi for the joke
yeah i'm sorry guys my my not my mic is
quiet i'm quiet i have a sore throat i'm
under the weather right now it's why
i'm sweating like a hug and everything
my throat's all scratchy so i'm i'm just
quieter than normal
um let's switch to some graphics stuff
so some stuff uh
you knew there was going to be a dllss
question an fsr question alex let's just
let's just jump those ones right away uh
what can you tell us if anything about
dlss or fsr at some point any point in
development
uh must be someone that didn't watch the
last uh star citizen live
every show somebody's first um yeah um
i mean
upscaling is a
very common feature now you know every
single console game pretty much uses it
a huge percentage of the aaa pc games
use it um
it's it's the
i don't know it's the future but it's
it's the current like this is the
expected way if you want extreme
resolutions unless you have like the the
fastest graphics card um and even when
you do there's actually reasons that the
lss and fsr can exceed the quality of
native resolution in many scenarios they
the compromises sometimes there's
artifacts in some situations but on a
stable frame you can actually get higher
quality because it's actually super
samples the image beyond the number of
pixels you actually have so it's like a
perfect anti-airlift image or it can
theoretically can achieve a perfect
anti-list image which a native render
cannot
so um yeah they're definitely the future
um or in the next few years the way to
get to 4k and beyond
um in terms of the implementation we
need to just finish gen12 first and
there's no point
this is like by far the biggest
performance improvement is the cpu gains
we need to make from gen 12 um but the
ls as an fsr
or an equivalent are type of top of the
list
uh in terms of the general rendering
improvements we have lots of other
workflows you know the pu and squadron
that we need to get on with in terms of
general render improvements these are
the top of the list um
so yeah definitely um
um i like i said last time though i'm
not gonna promise one over the other or
timelines for them or whether we even
come up here and one you know epic came
up their own one that um it's more
similar to a hybrid of the two
[Music]
who knows um but you know
the existing apis for dlss and fsr are
theoretically going to be easier to
implement than rolling your own one so
that's the most likely scenario and most
likely would be to support both
but we have to see when we get to it and
one thing that makes them a little bit
awkward to implement our engine is
because traditionally you render your
scene you upscale it to 4k or whatever
and then you end your ui on top of that
however our ui is very much in the world
a lot of cases we have holograms in the
world we have mfds on ships we have
floating holograms uh holographic
displays in the ships as well
uh mobile glass all these things so
they're not a flat 2d image projected on
top of the render they're actually part
of the world
which makes it problematic because if
you try and upscale very intricate text
and ui these algorithms tend to destroy
it
and do some evil things for
for what you really want to be crystal
clear so we already have a solution
which type of splits are rendering so
that certain parts of the ui type of
they have when they get to a certain
size on screen or distance they type of
swap to a different mode that renders
them and make sure that the post effects
don't interfere with them
so we're hoping we can capitalize on
that and use the same technique so we
can do
fsr or dlss to the main portion of c
then some objects get removed from that
and composite it on top but that does
make some things complicated for us so
that's that's a little like oh we have
to see how it's going to work um it'll
probably won't be
bug-free in that sense so we'll have to
tweak that till we get it right but yeah
it's definitely something we need
upscaling is
important and for the vast majority of
our users i see as the common group you
know some people want to a native but
i think once people have it and they see
yeah i can well especially once they
have the cpu gains which you need um but
once you've got cpu gains and you can
get 60 and you're like ah i can have
native 30 fps so i can have you know
upscaled 60fps you know maybe i'll you
know
might be an easier choice once they see
it i'm imagining the kotaku article now
star citizen developer says feature
probably not bug free
[Music]
uh
let's see while we're on graphic let's
let's just do our greatest hits here uh
how is hd hdr support coming along
i want to sell them
uh yeah um i i talked to our developer
who works on that and
right now he
other priorities took over
um that task so it's not hard right now
but
yeah he
once he he's doing home office right now
a lot of the time but and and he has
like a super fancy hdr monitor in the
office so once he comes back which
hopefully soon and we
even gonna move into the new office soon
which i'm super excited about um yeah
hopefully then he can um
take it on and
finish it because i'm i'm very much
interested in that as well
for everyone who doesn't know what hdr
is it
it means a high dynamic high dynamic
range basically it means um colors can
or colors from a monitor can be much
more brighter and vivid
than a
standard monitor like everyone's used to
so and rendering always or
rendering in physically based rendering
which most engines these days do and
they already render an hdr and then as a
post-process effect all those colors get
like compressed into what we call low
dynamic range ldr
and that's what your monitor after some
other
fancy post-processing effects like um
gamma needs to be applied but yeah
that's the story for something uh for
something else but yeah
so i think hopefully
so a bunch of sport i think has been
done i think uh the last i looked the
the tasks that were meaning to make that
fully finished is three of them i think
so we have um
color processing is something they are
to supply where like you know they they
want to set the mood of a scene and they
are on a blue tinted sky
and they don't make the you know they
won't tent the actual sky when they want
to achieve a mood that you know they
they went to the sky physically accurate
and then they just postponed you know if
you imagine uh bad example that every
night time scene in a film is filmed in
daylight then they just make it blue you
know it's a
exaggeration but that's kind of the
approach um so sometimes the artists use
these things usually quite subtly but
that process is
currently mapping one low dynamic range
color into another low dynamic range
color the process becomes a bit more
complicated when you're dealing with
high dynamic range colors you know when
they say they want to turn
a white sky sky to blue or you know blue
sky to white
it gets more complicated there's now
millions of shades of white millions of
shades of blue like how
you know did you just mean the very
bright blues or the ultra bright blues
or the extremely bright blues like so
that process needs to be changed and it
involves changing the art pipeline a
little bit and how they offer the color
correction
and the two other issues are the
we have what we call the game post
effects which are like not the critical
rendering ones like uh color correction
or type of lighting and
blurs and things like this but just like
when you've been shot blood appears on
the screen or you're blacking out and
these types of effects they'll run in
low dynamic range so they'll need
uh to convert into html and higher note
range so they don't lose the quality
otherwise they'll appear very dull if we
don't do that
and then the final one is there's a the
more open-ended one
uh when people say this game has a good
hdr implementation and this game has a
bad one that's type of
we like someone said we already rendered
the game in hdr the problem is even the
html monitor isn't actually
high but it's not infinite dynamic range
um we would stop there if we had
infinite bank range we'll just give you
the image we rendered but that's not the
case so what you have to do is you have
to query the monitor find out what range
it's got and type of do a best guess of
how bright you think you should render
the image and how you should kind of
correct the image and then
probably also give some sliders for the
user so they can kind of tweak it
themselves but that can be a hugely
subjective
point of view and like say different
games get either praised or or beaten
for how amazing or terrible their hdr
implementation is but it's really just
that last part
uh in the pipeline that people uh get
upset over so yeah with that we need to
just balance that and make sure we
expose the right
knobs and tweaks to get everyone to get
the image they want on their monitor it
doesn't help that there's probably a
dozen hdr standards or a half dozen hdr
yeah lots of color spaces lots of
different ranges different ways of
interpreting things it's a bit of a
minefield yeah
uh you mentioned
well you sort of mentioned night vision
but you got close enough that we can't
avoid it now the question that comes up
for every other team and they keep
putting it i always put it off to the
graphics team what can you tell us if
anything about
night vision
tools uh uh any option for players for
to
to improve their their experience
flying or fighting at night
last time this came up you promised you
were going to lynch todd pappy
um so i i think you should follow
through on that promise
and get in and uh because we need uh we
need i have technical ideas and thoughts
on that but we need via
design like is is night vision in the
future the same as now is it infrared is
it was it based on
you know some other forward technology
but um
yeah what i've mentioned in the past is
that if you want to do it really well
then you use you know you emulate what
we call spectral rendering which is an
incredibly complicated field but
there's elements of it you can you can
simulate um where you can
type of identify the materials that have
a non-standard way of reflecting
infrared light uh which would be like
you know anything well anything that
glows in the dark or spheres to glow in
the dark on an infrared camera um
which is type of you know like
reflective gear like you know your
i don't know i can't think of any good
examples right now but um
uh there's certain materials that type
of don't reflect as you'd expect um so
they need
picking out especially otherwise they
don't doesn't look right in night vision
um otherwise it's type of a filter you
need to type of take your um your the
colors and kind of
uh it's a computer topic it's hard to
ever break it down but what we see is
red green and blue is obviously not the
true picture of what happens in reality
in reality there's there's millions of
wavelengths of light infinite
wavelengths in a longer spectrum and
then infrared is just looking at one
portion of that spectrum but we don't
the artist doesn't model what happens in
that different spectrum they just model
what happens
in these very three specific spectrums
of the human eye can see so we have the
type of map
or guess how do we get from the artist
or what colors to the these type of the
infrared spectrum or whatever spectrum
our imaginary night vision might be
um and there's ways of approximating
that or you can offer custom textures if
you want to like say if the artist can
tell this is exactly what it looks like
in infrared but we clearly can't go and
we make every texture in the entire game
to show how the infrared would work we
double the textures in the game so it's
you normally do like some type of
automated mapping that guesses
a best guess approach and then you have
to override the particularly special
case ones but yeah it's all going to
start with todd in the request
so you did good you did good the next
time next time i ask the question will
be to todd uh he's actually i don't
think he's actually been on a show since
the last time we had you on he's managed
to avoid it thus far
um
how is the graphic system going to
accommodate large fleet battles uh
greater than 50 fighters plus multiple
capital ships the lighting budget alone
would seem too crazy for that scenario
as things are right now
what you got for me jonas
yeah
yeah right now
you will very likely be cpu bound
in this situation because so many ships
they all need to go through the render
threat alone
but with upcoming gen12 changes it's
hopefully the changes that we make
will very likely improve that at least
from the rendering side because we can
distribute your distribute the work
more evenly across your cpu course
and that should help there
but of course there are other systems
than just rendering that you need to
keep in mind for example ai or
game code or physics or whatever that
also takes apart on the cpu so
um j12 will of course improve it but uh
yeah it's hard to say how much
and
sorry all right i'm gonna say on the
lighting side because i was mentioning
the question as well um the lighting
tends not to be a big issue in space
obviously space is mostly pretty dark
not too many
uh
not too much light going around there we
obviously can potentially have lights on
the lasers but they're quite easy also
to type of lod out if we were
particularly struggling for performance
um
ironically we're in a big ship battle
one of the things that hurts us quite
hard is the interior of the spaceships
um we don't have a great way of
not rendering the interiors of
spaceships so obviously if you can't see
a window then we call them out or if
they're very far away we call them out
but if you can see in the spaceship or
you have like the 600i with all its
glass
you can't just not render it you need an
approximation of what's inside that
group and that's quite difficult to make
you know you can't just fade it to black
because like this say 600 is a very
bright interior it just fades to black
looks really bizarre
so um one thing we were planning is to
use type of
we have these cube maps we call them
environment probes which type of they
used in the lighting system to type of
capture the environment and then reflect
it and as a substitute type of more
advanced fade racing reflections so we
were planning on using them to kind of
render a low quality version of the room
the type of would be indistinguishable
at the distances we're talking about but
would be the correct colors and have the
correct type of geometry in there and so
that will give us a way of basically
culling all the interiors of the ships
when we've got a massive fleet battle
going on and we don't really care
exactly how the interior looks just as
long as the right color and you know
rough shape of the geometry inside so
that would help and that's that would
save us the lighting cost of all this
interiors um which was yeah but i think
largely it's a cpu issue like you and i
said um
gen 12 it'd be that definitely are part
of the problem
we'd have to see profile what the likes
of the physics and other threads are
doing i'm sure they'd have optimizations
to do as well
for everyone who's interested how these
interiors could be rendered just check
out the some footages from from the
latest spider-man games on playstation
how they do it that's
an example on how you can do it
uh
how's the tech coming which replaces the
windows of buildings with the 3d looking
interior the new window shader
how's that
coming i think that's exactly what jonas
mentioned i believe is that do they do
that in the spider-man jonas
staring at the question when you when
you hit it so i was like i'll just ask
it now
yeah so
we already have um this kind of we call
it interior shader in in our engine just
as a standalone shader right now
and i actually didn't know bef
actually didn't know about it like a
month ago before i've seen it in game
because i had to fix a buck for 1012 on
it so um
i've seen it live in the engine and i
was i was already impressed it looks
pretty damn cool and
we're already experimenting right now in
engine um
with it and
so i'm
optimistic that we gonna see it very
soon
and but yeah most it's mostly art art
site now who has to implement it and
yeah test and iterate on it and yeah
make sure that it looks good and
but yeah
from the technology side everything's
working looking good so it's at the
point where it's ready for artists to
start playing with it and then they're
going to discover their bugs and all the
problems with it and then they'll come
back to you to fix it exactly yeah yeah
i mean they're already playing with it
and
i'm excited to see it in engine it's
definitely gonna
give some more life to those buildings
when you can actually see inside
uh
with all the great optimizations seen in
317
do you have plans to have ship lights
cast shadows in the near future also
helmet lights
i liked how they buttered you up with
some compliments at the beginning and
then asked something
not related to it whatsoever
but ship lights casting shadows that's a
big
one um
we've come back and
we've gone back and forth a few times
internally um i don't uh it's controlled
by the art setup so i never know for
sure what it has and hasn't been set up
on each spaceship um
but the problem with with the feature is
the cost doesn't uh it's quite difficult
to control the cost of this so one
spaceship floating around in space if
you put shadows in them lights no
problem at all you park 50 of them all
together pointing at each other in a you
know a really busy location and you all
get out your spaceships and jump around
in front of them
stack up boxes and all the crazy things
people do in the pu um it's gonna start
costing a serious amount of uh gpu to do
that um
so we have to figure out how we can add
it yeah keep it under control in the
more difficult scenarios um
and it's been suggested as we can like
you know just fade these shadows out
when they're too costly but that
actually becomes much more complicated
than you think because what you don't
want to happen is have you moved your
camera and look around the scene things
are popping on and off all the time you
want a stable consistent visual
um
but we've got some ideas of how we might
handle that and to try and
uh avoid the issue um and we might apply
the same idea for all type of dynamic
lights from like ships your helmet light
your flashlights um and muzzle flashes
on guns there's another request to have
shadows um all these things the muzzle
flashes especially is something that
it'd be great to have shadows from the
muzzle flashes but you know if 50 people
are firing in a room then maybe you can
say oh we don't care so much um but it's
things we could also just you know uh
mostly we could provide to the user to
say you know do you want these how many
dynamic lights do you want to support
um let them choose if they want to pay
that cost
but there is also some internal budgets
we couldn't
um like we have basically like a texture
pool where all the shadows go into once
we've exceeded that there's just no more
space um without sacrificing the quality
in the rest of the level so yeah i'm
hoping we can come up some type of
system know how many dynamic lights do
you want maybe like you know eight might
be a
a default or four or something like that
and then you can scale up whatever you
want if you want to take that hit when
you have a really busy scenario
um yeah so hopefully um but yeah the
shift ones are particularly problematic
because they can cast
thousands of meters
and cover huge areas um which means
you know if you cover a whole space
station there might be a few thousand
draw calls in that space station which
is like a instruction for the gpu you
just double that by putting your lighter
and you know 50 people putting 50 lights
at it you know 50 times the cost for
that space station
that's a big deal
yeah uh besides the the the ship lights
and the shot casting another bit another
graphical tech thing that comes up quite
often i've seen it a couple times in the
chat already today and it was in the
thread as well uh rtt's for to use as
exterior cameras
uh for ships um ideally one at the
bottom to make landing a whole lot
easier uh for folks uh is there anything
you could you can you can tell us
uh i'm also gonna point you to uh a todd
pappy or someone again um or another
design director maybe uh jungkook um i
i've actually been pushing for this i
want this um but with one giant gotcha i
don't want a photo realistic camera
like you know like a i'd prefer um
mainly because of cost i think you'll
just you'll pay a frame rate cost when
that happens um if you play a racing
game like uh you know any fours or
something like this they'll have like
their wing mirrors and their review
camera but they have heavily optimized
their game to make that work and they've
heavily optimized what happens in that
review camera you'll notice they never
look as good
um
we have a hugely complicated game
there's much more than just a roadway so
we know we have
orbit with gas clouds we have all sorts
going on so to render all of that again
periodically in a external camera it you
know a worst case scenario could half
your frame rate um which we don't want
so
more sensible for me is that we do some
kind of like lidar depth camera i think
you'd actually be getting cars in real
life and i think that'd be far more
useful to be honest because
um imagine
if you're landing a giant spaceship on
like a space station you don't really
have any sense of scale like
it's an enormous beast and you're
landing on what might be something
that's like concrete or just tiled metal
panels you don't know how close you are
so i think something that really kind of
gives you a great sense of depth even if
there's not a lot of interest there or
let's say their example might be landing
on a snowy mountain
you you won't be able to tell anything
if we just show you a white picture
underneath the spaceship so yeah i think
a depth camera or lighthouse or some
type of holographic you know some type
of nice imaginative non-photoreal uh
render would be very cheap and be cool
so yeah i'd love that
as long as design don't ask the photo
bill then i'll hide
um
lots of folks in chat
have been asking about ultra wide
support
scaling for things like chat hud
personal inventory etc uh some some of
these monitors are getting super
ridiculously wide now 32 9 and stuff
like that um
what are the challenges involved what
what can you guys
tell us about
uh better ultra wide support
so i myself using a ultrawide support
monitor so
i
know about the the issues um
with star citizen um unfortunately we as
graphics and engine we don't have too
much to do with that it's more like a
question for ui and
how they implement it especially in the
building block system
and yeah just
how the ui scales with all those
different monitor resolutions
i'm not sure maybe ali knows a little
bit more about that if there are
priorities on that or
no no
it's not easy
we've actually got something with the ui
team scheduled here in the next
i think the next two months i think so
um okay prepare lots of questions for
them then um there's a few graphical
things like of ultrawide that we
sometimes need to fix or improve the
performance of maybe like um or
sometimes the quality of maybe our post
effects aren't always amazing and super
wide and also you know if you super wide
depending on how we deal with the aspect
ratio kind of more objects to render and
obviously you have more pixels to render
so you know gen 12 and other
optimizations like dlss and things we've
talked about would all help there but
yeah in terms of just making it you know
a fun experience with you know where you
positioned the hud and the
chat windows and stuff but yeah it's all
on the ui team the end and we don't
really have any control of that
um let's see we've only got 10 minutes
to go let's see what more we can squeeze
in here uh are there any plans in the
future to to dynamically use more vram
for cards that have it available for
example the game seems to use six gigs
on my 390 but i have 24 gigs available
would you also would more vram usage
allow for better frames or higher
quality textures
yes
okay
so first thing i'd say is
um you don't want to use 24 gigs just
because you can like you want to use
what you need
but yeah
so the question is is the quality
improvements we could make
which way we could use them 24 gigs
at the moment
the system is such that basically
it assumes it wants to achieve the
resolution you ask for so if you ask for
4k it's going to spend a lot of money
achieving 4k it looks what memory it's
got left on your graphics card and it
says okay i'll use all that's rest left
on the meshes and textures
and it will scale up the texture budget
up until about three or four gigs i
think the internal limit is of how much
you lose on textures um we could uncap
that that three gig limit and put it to
100 gigs or whatever and it'll just try
and load all the textures in the game um
for you um the only reason there is we
haven't really uncapped that is
it doesn't usually lead to any visual
improvement like three gigabytes tends
to get you every single texture we have
on screen loaded at the highest quality
we have available
so um raising up is just risks a little
bit we might get some streaming issues
where
your hard drive just starts churning
away and
maybe you've got a fast hard drive it's
okay but maybe you don't have such a
fast hard drive and you're wondering why
the game runs slow and because it's
trying to load the 24 gigs of textures
you've asked for which you don't really
need
so um that's where the situation today
where we want to be though with uh once
we've finished 1012 is to expose some of
these numbers to the player instead so
you pick your resolution and it shows
you how much money is left and you pick
how much text resolution you want to use
um and then you can download upwards and
then if you want to hang yourself you
know put 24 gigs of textures and maybe
it does look better maybe it doesn't but
we'll give that to user to pick how they
uh distribute the memory
um one thing i would say is one thing it
would be nice which we can't promise
booze something would definitely is a
future option is to have a high-res
texture pack um we offer all of our
textures at double the resolution we
actually ship them at
um but there's some several issues in
trying to achieve at the moment uh
mainly just the size of the build would
would obviously go enormously high
um and that has costs associated with as
well on the back end side there was
there's some money
uh a cost for
bandwidth um so we also have some some
tasks in the pipeline to reduce the size
of the build
um so you know you know we're this is
stuff that's a higher level decision
than we can make in our team but
maybe if we have detectors available and
we have technology to use them we also
save a bunch of memory on the build
maybe we get to a point where it's more
viable
uh to have a high-risk texture pack and
then the people that do have
uh 20 gigs or whatever memory will have
a very real reason to use that memory
and you know if you say double the
resolution of every texture that would
be four times the texture memory so our
three gigatexture limit might go to 12
gigs instead
um at least so and 12 gigs once you add
on 4k and a few other things you each
get to 16 to 20 gigs of memory so
so yeah this is a um something in the
future definitely um there is some
technologies as well in the future that
we might use that could eat up some of
that memory things like weight tracing
and sdfs uh distance fields that are
used for various pieces of technology
these all consume extra memory
we just have to make sure the game can
still scale so that the people that have
six gigs or whatever can still run the
game you know sensibly
you understand i have to put everything
ultramax ultra ultra
right just all the sliders got to go up
alley
yeah not worth playing if i can't max
everything out
well interesting a lot of old games used
to let you max out beyond what your gpu
could do um i think some games now have
taken the approach that we're talking
about here where if you maximize it it
will not let you like it but if you want
to run it your game at 8k and to have
all the textures loaded in the world
it's not it's not going to happen
there's no space physically there
so
yeah it will kind of force you to live
within the constraints of your gpu it
should be a whole new like difficulty
level settings in graphic settings that
you like like the the demon souls
version of graphics settings
you know that just that you know you run
the risk of murdering your computer
we definitely hope to have that yeah
that's a definite goal we want
um
all right let's see if we can drop some
uh more engine related questions in
before we get going uh
let's see
is it planned to support direct storage
on windows 11 and do you expect a
performance boost from it
we have
at least taken a look at that but
[Music]
we already have a custom
technology in place to improve the
memory transfer to the gpu
so it's unclear if we can gain a lot of
performance from that
that's something we will have to take
that people looking to measure and check
where it makes sense if it makes sense
and then it will probably be implemented
the diplomatic answer here
all right
um
this next question's about lots and and
distance uh what's being done with this
uh the pop in is honestly dreadful and
seems the render distance for ground
foliage trees rocks and such is so low
that it is really jarring visually
compared to anything else
will this change or increase due to gen
12 or vocal implementation or what can
you tell us overall
lot popping
um yeah i i'm seeing that too
the thing is that's mostly um
decided by art how they want to set it
up of course it's
measured based on performance so
um
but 1212 and vulcan
it'll improve another performance and i
i think we we will scale it up at one
point
um
but yeah i'm not sure what what exactly
is planned there if there's anything
official yet so
[Music]
yeah this is the cpu um
plans or not not concrete but definitely
um discussions of the planet tech team
about
how we can take things one level higher
um at the moment basically each object
is considered an incidence an individual
object in the scene um this type of
spawned and managed the position of it
um we do have some small scales grouping
where like we might group five or ten
objects together but what you need if
you want to say render an entire
rainforest is the ability to have
millions of trees and just to have the
concept exist of an individual tree
means that that becomes beyond the reach
of a sensible speaking cure you need to
have the concept of it this is a whole
you know this is a patch of forest that
might be a kilometer wide or 10
kilometers wide and the type of the
trees either never existed individually
and that type of a group or
they are being spawned extremely quickly
and then merged into one type of uber
club that we just type of can submit to
the gpu
or even nightmares with gpu but like
type of just render on the gpu
without any cpu involvement but yeah but
the current approach of type of having
one object you know type of constructed
and sent to the gp reach frame it just
doesn't scale quite to the to the level
we need but yeah gen 12 will
give us like a big boost on what would
be possible with the current system but
yeah those there's plans for the extreme
lods we'd call them like you know the
rainforest where you could just sleep
for miles and miles of trees that need
something slightly different for that to
work
and and all these objects on the planets
they're already using a more specialized
path to
be rendered much quicker than our usual
objects like all those brushes
uh but yes i pointed out um if we want
to have like really dense light forests
like you've seen a microsoft flight
simulator
um there's definitely a lot of room to
improve and
definitely something we're looking at
aware of and yeah hopefully we'll
implement something in the future about
that
oh we're just about out of time so let's
let's
end with something a little more general
uh
for graphics
engine performance
gen 12 what's the
what's the what's the immediate future
look like like like like
what what do you got on your what you
got on your
agenda for the next
three six months
here no dates no it just just what are
you working towards right now
well as i already pointed out the
beginning we want to finish 1012 so
there are few more milestones we have to
finish the transparent rendering that's
the biggest one
and yeah once that's done
i expect
all the other things which are missing
which more like a few compute passes uh
like planet atmosphere stuff and like
compute skinning
and a few other things we're probably uh
half of a look at um are finished
um we have then gentle offs done and i
really excited to see how um
how much performance we gained from that
and
yeah um
after that we can walk in which is not
um lacking too far far behind because
like in general we're um developing 1012
and vulcan parallel
and vulcan is just lacking a little bit
behind so once gen 12 is done um
it shouldn't take us
too long to even get a first version of
vulcan working
okay anything you want to add to that
ally jonas
uh now we've got like uh we've got these
guys have 10 12 on the entry team we've
got um about half the graphics team on
gen 12 as well um
the ones that aren't on that um
are working on a number of features
mainly
there's a bit of a backlog for s42 type
of the critical features we need for
that they'll obviously feed into the pu
as well there's very little that would
be specific to squadron it's more just
you know who who is the prime
uh
you know need for for each feature but
yeah there's a few features in the works
for them
um
some research for longer term uh
features like uh jump points um to the
graphical implementation of that
um
things like uh improving the water
effects is something that's on the kind
of near-term goals as well and unifying
then we have like a planet uh ocean
shader we have a water volume shader we
have a river shader
um these things all need work and love
and integrate them with the vfx as well
we don't we've lost in the in the in the
transition of our engine over to
you know all the improvements with major
planets and stuff we've lost like
splashes and dynamic waves and stuff
like this so we need to
reintroduce these types of technologies
and um
that's ibm mainly of a half team on gen
12 and when that's done they'll be on
vulcan until that is running butter
buttery smooth um
and even then that team might in then
look at the dls uh fsr type approaches
and only then will the type of
join the rest of the team on the uh the
general graphics features
cool
um yeah two or two more things i would
like to say really quickly um like one
of the questions was could we pay a beer
to christopher balti so i want to have a
small shout out to balti for all the
nice improvements he did for 3.17
and
he he claimed all all those improvements
for himself
internally
so give them a big shout out
and one last thing i've promised one of
my friends
okay there's your dab
yeah that's it
all right i think i think they might
have finally found out the way to make
sure i never invite them back on the
show ever again
dab
we're going to see ian leon dab on the
next show just to get out of it
all right
everybody uh thank you so much jonas
sylvan and ally for taking time out of
the end of your week to be here on the
show
um
uh
folks if you haven't check out
yesterday's inside star citizen uh it
was a special tools time episode uh
detailing uh the work of two of our
tools teams one in montreal and one in
uk on some recent things that they've
done um
it's it's it's not the flashiest show
but it's the kind of thing that only
star citizen whatever touched explore so
those tend to be my favorite and so
thank you so much for indulging me uh in
in those really really esoteric behind
the scenes stuff i will be back next
week with a all sprint report ish
episode of inside star citizen so that
you have all that so you can get all
your your cool visuals and stuff back uh
and then we're back here uh
next week on scl i think it's the
modular content team i'm not sure it's
my i don't my schedule's all upside down
right now
uh but
take care i
remember that invictus launch week was
just uh announced yesterday the day
