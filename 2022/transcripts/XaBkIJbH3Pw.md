## Transcript

why do you want to start the show since
we're we're just doing it on let me just
do the title card we'll just do a title
card there we go
and then we'll do we'll do me like hi
everybody
uh welcome to star citizen live
uh i'm talking to you uh from from the
void uh i am traveling uh this week uh
doing some things we'll talk about uh in
the future
uh
but we're doing today's show from the
void here uh joining us on the show this
week are our two members from our uh
esteemed uh props team uh that's louis
and thomas say hi lewis and thomas
hello everyone
thomas do you have any light in your
room whatsoever why are you so dark i i
don't know why i'm so dark i uh but i
got everything before and do this oh
open a blank notepad open up blank
notepad and make it really big on your
screen oh that's small
look at that look at that
there we go that worked from home glow
who's who's been doing this forever he's
been doing this forever
all right now granted uh this is a game
dev show uh if you've never seen a game
dev episode it's where uh we spend most
of our time uh in screen share and you
won't see our faces anyway uh as we
create something uh
to potentially go into the persistent
universe uh louis what are we making
today
today so today what we're going to be
doing is uh
you know we looked at the feedback from
the cone
and we thought uh we do think of a bit
more interesting today um so what we're
going to be doing is turning a cone 2.0
yeah we're doing a cone again uh because
everyone loved the first one
no um today we're going to be turning um
a white box mesh that we've been working
on that's going uh into the game so this
is not specifically made for this stream
but this is actually something that's
going to be going into our um our pyro
stations later on um which is
it's basically a trolley so we're going
to be doing the setup on the trolley and
we're going to have at the end of the
stream hopefully if all goes well an
interactable trolley that we could push
around with some cool items on it so
yeah
fingers crossed all day as well knowing
date at forge it won't but
but we'll see and before we get started
uh who who who are you ever it's
everybody's first show so louis
introduce yourself and then thomas you
can introduce yourself
so yeah i'm lewis thompson i'm a i'm a
cone modeler from the box team um but
yeah just make props um so
i think probably the most notable thing
that i've done in the game so far i made
the medical beds um
so when that update came out you've all
probably woken up in one of my beds at
one point so
yeah
you heard it here first you've all woken
up in lewis's bed
uh thomas who are you what do you do
i'm thomas uh i'm also part of the box
team
and i've yeah i've been working for cig
since six months now and i passed
probation not long ago so i'm a full
artist a box team member now
and
and yeah i've done the trophy for the
citizencon this year so you probably got
it in your hands and that's my first
props
i implemented in the game so i'm pretty
proud of it
all right
an awesome trophy as well awesome
thank you
well lewis if you want if you want to
start up the screen share we can jump
into it
okay let's go
okay let's go
oh my my perforce is crying
all right cool
so
um
everything's disappeared
that's per tradition
so what we have here um we basically
wait wait
hold on hold on real quick richard tyres
is calling me
hey
hey rich we're live on the stream right
now how are you awesome
what's going on man hey you you called
me and i'm just you know being happy and
calling you back
oh well how you doing i'm doing well
i'll i'll leave you to your stream if
you're
streaming that's just lewis
just
okay now i'll call you back after the
show all right have fun bye-bye bye
all right
as you were lewis and thomas right cool
so
what usually happens when we we start a
new task on props we get sent a cool
piece of concept art by one of our many
talented concept artists
um this is this is one of them um
so yeah we'll have this image and we've
basically got to go around and
and work out how to turn it from this 2d
image into a working object in the game
so
um obviously this is like a little pump
truck trolley type thing so
we can make it interactable uh we've got
wheels we've got a handle so we can turn
this into a trolley essentially
that players can interact with so and in
the us would we refer to that as a
pallet mover
a pallet neither yeah hell yeah
i always get confused when we're naming
stuff uh on on props especially because
like there's so many different ways of
saying
like is it the american way or the
british way and we always get sick yeah
the the the the colloquial
is pallet jack
is what we would call it
because the forks go into the prime into
the holes at the bottom of the pallet
and then you crank the handle down and
it it jacks it up off the ground like a
like an automotive jack
yep yeah so a pallet jet we've got a
we've got actually got a pallet in the
scene that hopefully we're going to be
able to once we've got it running
hopefully be able to get it
on there so
i'm gonna start uh yeah i'm just gonna
go away so tom if you wanna like
start
chatting so i'll try to make some way on
this
yeah so basically uh now lewis is
checking if everything is you know
separated to put the anchor points so
like he is checking like if the wheel as
it's gonna roll by itself it is being
separated
and just making sure the whole hierarchy
is
well done
in this uh in this scene
and
once it cut that we will separate it
things up
so we can actually push it in the scene
and having fun with it
so this this was something that was
created previously just to be a a visual
item in the background and and now you
have to convert it into something that
npcs can actually move around
yeah essentially right okay
like i said because we're not doing this
just for the stream this is actually a a
prop that i've been assigned to work on
this week so um eventually it's going to
look something like this with all the
pom details and the materials like done
up
at the moment it is literally just
kind of white yeah
grey box so
it's still uh if i move this back over
here
is there a designer attached to this do
we have any stats on this pallet jack
can it lift above its weight class
i've heard that uh it can lift the
reclaimer uh it's that is that good we
designed them strong
if you go if you if you go back to a
really old scl uh the reclaimer can't
even escape the gravity of a planet's
atmosphere
oh my god i didn't call it flying that
for the first time
yes we're creating this in response to
uh for that special reclaimer so we can
lift it up
yeah essentially so what we have um to
make a trolley what we need to do um let
me let me move this
um
so we've got two points on each wheel so
we've got the point at which uh
the wheel rotates so
for example like this so that we can
maneuver it and then there's one for the
actual wheel to spin so that the wheels
spin like they do in the game like like
a realistic wheel um
and basically what we need to do in
order to
uh have this function is create two
point helpers so i believe
yeah the main one and the wheel one yeah
so this will be wheel turn one so we'll
call this wheel will be wheel one um
you know we're really good with naming
conventions here we don't have the
lights over
this this will be the uh uk version of
maneuvering with an extra u in it right
yeah exactly
so um so
with this new point helper we've got
this um we then attach the geometry
which we want to rotate so now basically
when we rotate this the geometry will
move with it and when we create um
like collision meshes for it as well we
can put that in under that in the
hierarchy and that will also uh move
along with that
um so we've got that mesh
so now what we need to do is make
another helper so that tells that that
mesh where to spin
uh like this
so the next one uh is gonna tell the
wheel
what to do so we're gonna do instead of
wheel turn this one's going to be called
uh wheel spin spin again again we like
we like our fancy naming conventions
but now we've got so for this wheel
we'll go ahead sorry i'm going to say
everybody knows that star citizen we're
really good at naming things that's one
word strong suits
um somebody in chat was asking uh why
are you using 3d max in a blender
uh as long as you are like i think that
in in cig what's cool that it's that you
can use any tool that you want as long
as you work well with it and you are
efficient and everything i think
everyone really agree with that
and that's
yeah that's yeah you'd agree that
blender is better though
trying to learn blender at home but it's
it's so once you've you've got max
ingrained in your head when you go to
blender it's like it's exactly different
it's so like there's so much to it i'm
really really trying i'm really trying
to like it
as long as you're making good art the
tool that you're using is
it's not really the model i would say
i'd like to load up an old copy of like
bryce 3d from 1999 see what i could do
when i was younger i used to use a
sketchup and you'd always have like
creepy 2d man uh staring here when you
start the program
the one that always turns to face the
camera
i i used to learn uh 3d on maxon
actually cinema 4d
that was quite cool yeah i i i used 3d
max
in the late 90s and you know back when
we were we used to like
download models of like x-wings
that other people had posted the
bulletin boards uh and then you know
make our own little animated uh trench
runs
well i think what i didn't that i opened
in sketchup once i downloaded someone
had done like a a model of the citadel
from mass effect
like one of the um you know the big bit
that curves around and it's got all the
foliage and the balconies and like the
main presidium i think it is i i loaded
that in and i remember my like my 150
pound laptop literally like started
screaming i've never heard a sound like
that come from a computer
but my god it was like nope
can't handle this please sexy
i'm thrilled to see some
some people my age that remember bryce
3d
yeah bryce 3d how many canyons did you
guys make i made hundreds of canyons
i used to fly those x-wings through them
i was just gonna stay uh yeah do it when
i learned 3d i was like
a lot of like star wars stuff as well
like in jared it's yeah
what scene was it you made again for
your personal work
uh the one on youtube
was it the i mean it was palpatine's
room wasn't it
ah yeah yeah i did like the the
palpatine's office and then regine
yeah
yeah when i'm doing 3d for my personal
work it's often star wars related thing
did you do palpatine's throne room and
jedi or did you do his office in like
you know you know now in you know the
office in uh on coruscant you know
yeah
you know with his office uh yeah i did
that in another engine
oh we're missing a wheel
there it is
now don't forget to add the uh weapon
hardpoints here and uh yeah
do you know what let me let me let me
just go through my
downloads quickly because i swear when
we were making the original trolleys we
made a like a
battle trolley
[Laughter]
we were working on it cory made a gif of
it and we've got like uh like the i
can't i don't know what hard points
those are but we put a quantum drive on
the back of the trolley we've got
missiles we've got
a pilot's seat
i'm trying to convince these people the
props team aren't a bunch of screw-ups
and you're not helping me right now
this this was a research task this was
very important
it's a very interesting research test
yeah
now if you want the battle trolley folks
i suggest you take to reddit into a
spectrum
and start your threads now
uh r request the battle trolley uh lti
token
do it now it's glorious it's glorious
given to the might of the battle trolley
right um
grips there though no not yet so this is
what i'm gonna do next so um
basically we've got the wheels now uh
we've got the helpers that tell date of
forge uh how the wheels need to turn um
so they should all turn independently
and stuff uh considering hoping i've set
them up right the next thing we need uh
is a place for the player to be able to
grip the trolley and interact with it so
i'm just going to start making that now
but you got to make that one wheel that
has like a 15 degree
less turning radius that's you know
there's always one wheel it's always
sketchy
yeah
the part of the workflow that we love
about it most is when we send this off
to audio to
to basically add in a squeaky wheel uh
the
two-week research trip to tesco's the
first round
probably they can
so this is going to be a really
like
quick version obviously we take a lot
more time
for now i'm just going to do this so
this will be
mesh
interaction
one so yeah now you're making the mesh
and then you're gonna put the encode
points
and that's for like the targeted
animations so that they'll reach out and
grab for that
so
yeah
yeah uh for for folks
excuse me for folks who are just tuning
in and whatnot
a lot of what we're doing now it's it's
we had a three we had a white box uh
model of a trolley but it was meant for
like background and just you know
sitting there we are now converting it
into a usable
uh option with you know with wheels that
can uh rotate and function independently
uh the grip here so that uh players and
embassies like have a targeted location
for the animations to to grab onto and
then once it's been converted into a
proper usable we'll begin building it up
for
uh
the force potential use inside uh a pyro
space station uh this is a work that was
nor that was already on their workload
this is not something being created
specifically uh for the show uh this is
a task that um that these guys already
have on their uh a development docket so
we're just we're just killing two birds
uh with one stone here
this is how yours money is used spider
studio specifically yours money
yeah we handpicked yours
right
so yeah now you're put yeah did you put
the interaction point which is gonna be
the the text where the text of grip is
gonna appear i guess yeah so basically
this is a
this is where the interaction takes
place i believe
the interaction highlight is driven by
the collision mesh for it which is
why is that over here and a completely
different shape toward
ah again did it go this is fun right why
do you do it different way
why do you always kill birds lando i
just like the phrase i don't kill
anything i'm the guy that catches a fly
and walks it out outside of my front
door and lets it go
so no
there's a problem
that's about the only aspect of me
that's remotely awesome
is that like bias towards different
insects
i just i just
i just
everything's got its place in the
universe i don't have to like it but
you know just it doesn't and it doesn't
just doesn't have to do it inside my
house so i just move it out
of the house and then they can go off
and live their life
and do whatever task nature wanted them
to do somewhere else
right here we go so
so now it is converted as a proxy
so yeah this uh
if i rename it
my rename tool is not working fantastic
uh
let me just i'll do it manually
if i can remember physics
proxy yeah
and one yes and for the uh for the
blender questions that come in um
again uh as as usual this is one of
those kind of things we just we end up
repeating quite a bit over the eight
years that i've been doing this here at
cig
we we we allow uh most of our artists to
work in the tools with which they're
more they're most professional with so
so we have a a marvelous a tools team
here
whose job is to create all of these
importers and exporters and bridges and
and stuff between all these softwares so
that when we bring folks into the
project if their primary experience is
on 3d max or it's on blender or it's in
houdini or or whatever
we support that and let them work in the
aspects in which they are most uh
familiar yeah if they want to learn
other software's like like um
you just start saying that you're trying
to learn blender right now in his spare
time that's fine nothing but but we're
one of the things that i think we're
really proud of is how we support our
artists and letting them work in the
software that is most
native or comfortable to them yeah we
had a guy on the team that that
literally worked in blender and then
when he was finished he'd
move his assets over to max uh just to
use the tools that we used to export
them and stuff
so it's really flexible to be honest um
it's just whatever works fastest because
that's what you want really like fast
yeah i'm actually i'm actually getting
ready uh i think the next uh segment we
do for isc
uh that has to do with turbulent will
actually be with their tools team and
talking about magic bridge
it's have you ever seen that with that
with what they're building
between uh now they've built it they
built a new tool that uh
uh basically brings houdini inside of
yeah inside of the game engine and lets
them do it let's
that's that's houdini it basically does
live houdini stuff inside the game
engine and stuff it's really cool
but it's great oh no i know what i mean
yeah it's terrific for prop placements
you know it's they can sit there and
they just point at a shelf and go fill
this up with stuff and it fills it up
with bottles and you know all the things
that you guys have been making it now
makes the place go for it super cool
yeah
yeah i see what you mean now yeah we've
been trying to take a delve into houdini
on our side like developing some work no
place for it it's it's going to be
essential to to to really get that
coffee shop
uh gameplay into uh
317.
i know
i just love me in the chat and people
are super stoked about that copy shop
stuff so
and also what what i think it's really
great about what we do is
do you give us also the time to like
improve our skills in other softwares
from time to time
and it's really awesome to have like
this time to just work on on new skills
that we can grow
yeah definitely um like i said we've
been doing a bit houdini stuff um yeah
upcoming work that we're doing trying to
integrate that into our workflow um
yeah it's just it's really nice to be
able to
you know
this place really does recognize the
power of these these tools uh and i
think that's taken for granted
a bit in the game industry in some some
places you know
a lot of the times the engines will be
using like old tech and
and people are too afraid to move on and
learn some new stuff
there there's there's virtue to to both
approaches it's just yeah it's just if
there's one
underlying truth to all game development
unless this is all game development
anywhere is that there's no one right
way
to do every everything
it's just uh so we're we're big
proponents here of all right we got to
do this and then we got to do this we
gotta do this other thing this fourth
thing what are the most effective ways
to do each one and if they're not they
don't happen to be the same thing
through the same process you know that's
fine
as long as that as long as they all end
up in the same place
that's fine but
but the the arguments go both ways i i
see plenty of people
i could sit here and make a solid
argument for forcing everybody to use
the same tool
it's like this
that that's game development though
there's just no one way to do it
so
blender is better than 3d max though
i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt
your time
no no no no
straight for the first straight
so
here lewis did on this trolley i don't
know if you noticed but two anchor
points one for the left hand and one for
the right hand oh sorry yeah let's go
back yeah yeah just show them yeah
quickly so in the middle it's a grip
well it's the interactive point so
that's where you will see the text
messaging grip the thing and under the
two one the other two other one is just
the left hand right hand
so you can put your hands on it and now
we are gonna configure on it the how the
hands gonna behave on this and
to just say uh to do to the ai and to
your interaction points what and how you
are interacting with it
so here lewis is just renaming the
variant
yes
look
we've got like uh luckily we've got like
a a bunch of like templates we can pick
from depending what trolley we're using
so for example we got you know a
multi-grip one which means like a
trolley that you can grip from like
basically
uh two ends
um
there's
the single grip one which is just one
grip point which is what we're going to
be using there's stuff like the you know
the wheelchairs for
hospitals and stuff and and all sorts um
you know so for now what we're going to
do is going to jump in here
and plug in our geometry basically so
this is going to be
where we are where you link your your
mesh
my brain is ticking away i gotta give it
a refresh
come on
and my favorite part is it's gonna crash
my editor when i create this
ass
will we ever be able to use and sit in
the wheelchairs in the hospital
uh unknown
unknown uh
i think
i think it's safe to say that we would
all prefer that you can
it just it's it's the answer if it's
ever does it make things seem more
diegetic does it make things
act like we expect them to act the
answer is always going to be yes that's
what we want to do
but it always comes down to priorities
in time it's just
it's just do do we have a spot to take
the people necessary and assign them to
that task
yeah
we want to
but yeah
like for us uh usually we're just you
know making the geometry and plugging it
into something that's already been
programmed uh and then just configuring
it and tweaking it
but uh you know for us i know we're
always very very busy uh so
i can only imagine you know the
programming side creating these features
and you know there's a hell of a lot
that goes into just like you know it's
all good for me to come and just create
a variant but you know someone's already
come and paved the way for me to do this
in a big way you know it's been
developed over a long time when i first
joined like over a year ago like that
was when
this was being worked on
um
and there was like a good few months
where i joined in just to help support
the development of the trolleys and
there was a lot that went into it a lot
a lot of stress a lot of pain
um
but you know it's good it's good we love
this yeah and and for the for people who
have questions like why do we have
people working on trolleys and stuff
like this uh they are
principally a component of squadron 42
uh that they they are used in in several
of the background animations and and
things that are going on aboard life on
a on a ship like the idris or the
javelin or whatnot and so working is
prioritized for that purpose as we you
know
continue to
bring that game to completion and then
as what always does is the technology of
one the assets of one
can often be used to help and you know
push forward the other so
so we have our first
yeah
we have our first issue here it's a big
wheel it's the big wheel yeah
yeah
so maybe you have a rotation issue there
yeah yeah it was coming in at 90
instead of a zero
so i'm just going to move these out here
one for now
so we've got a bunch of like dodgy
transforms here so i'm just going to
reset all of those
and then
if we bring these back
i can use them already that's this one
yeah we'll we will turn that
when you look at the hierarchy sometimes
it's just it just blends into like yeah
it's just a blur of white and you're
like oh
i can't see so no it's right
oh it doesn't like this
that's because i'm disconnected from the
vpn to improve my internet connection oh
so if you connect in you're gonna
it might drop you from the show
um
we can give it a shot
it will still do it it just takes ages
to export so i just hope we get well
that's yeah almost
this is an issue from before this is
something i i need to go and fix but
it's it's not a huge issue for yeah just
the geometry issue yeah
um
max please come back to me uh why does
the vanguard's landing gear have wheels
and treads when he can't roll uh it
can't roll
at present
you can't roll now
that's all i'll say about that
max is not behaving let me let me try
let me try this
you're gonna stop the screen share if
you want until you
get the square
it's all right i just can't the thing is
i can't remember how to um
how to disconnect max from perforce when
it's
when it's disconnected from vpn because
basically uh it does a bunch of perforce
checks uh
when you export it so that all your
files that you're working on appear and
um
yeah it's all fine though um right so
and then we've also got this this wheels
bit funky sorry it's it's maybe the
second one yeah
the wheel same thing again
um
just double checking 90 degrees so we'll
reset that as well i've got a hot key
set up for that because reset x forms
and transforms is uh very important very
very yeah
there we go so that's resolved
cool
we got the same issues
so if i press ai in physics you see it
like it doesn't like that it it jumps
out the way
because of the way everything's set up
so lewis
while you fix that uh let's talk about
that art test that you had to do
um we actually had some folks in the in
uh chat asking what what what are the
what's what was the art test like for
you since you hired in so recently
yeah me i have like to do
a test for two weeks so
yeah you get the concept art uh corey
was really
cool he was just saying that they want
you to track your time of course play
the game and don't worry about this
uh just work like you would do um
show you like the steps that you did so
for example on my artist i just showed
that
i went to white box at this stage i went
to detail at that stage and worked on
the final art at that stage while
showing it in my track of time and yeah
it gives you
all the details of what you need to know
for your artist
and
yeah and basically you have fun with it
and show your artistic
view on the concept art because of
course you don't have to
that's the thing with concept art and
even our work in every day you have to
kind of have like a
big of an art
thing like side of things like you don't
do like
from
a to z to what you see in the concept
art just have fun with it like try to
adapt the shapes adapt the the props to
what you feel like it could be
uh
so it you know it is kind of
interesting to see and
how you see the props being interesting
basically and that's one thing that i
think we value a lot is seeing those
things
that you can have like an artistic side
of you those things
and yeah and it's really truly fun it's
really
it was a really great taste in my
opinion
i think you're back heavy there
louis i love it i love watching this
this stuff happens i remember the first
time i set up a trolley it i pressed
play and it just pinged off into the
distance and i was like uh-huh
yeah if we activate the physics we can
see the wheels are in the right
positions uh it rotates the points that
we want it to rotate uh this is a bit
down at the moment but that's something
i can fix by extending this mesh down
um but it's everything's sitting in the
right position um but obviously it's
very back heavy at the moment so at the
moment uh we don't have
apart from these so these are um
the debug for these is a bit dodgy but
if we go over to this um
this water we have
you can see that what data forge is
actually doing is um on that
those um those points
like here um it's actually spawning uh a
collision mesh
um
where the wheel is
and that basically what that allows us
to do is these essentially become the
collision for the wheels uh allowing us
to push them about
and obviously the actual mesh also has a
collision
uh
a collision mesh as well
um and we don't so the way that um the
physics are calculated for these objects
now i don't want to go too far into it
could be completely wrong but the the
way it's the way it's done
um my understanding is that it's done
via the collision proxy so if we
put the box for like the
box on each of these four blocks
uh it's a good time to remind you that
uh we're already halfway done by the way
time wise i think we do it i think we're
doing all right this time i think this
was a much better
uh
i think we're doing better for time than
we did the last stream we did yeah i
just want to make sure you you have time
to build it up that's all
okay
activate turbo let's go
so yeah i'll just
grow it yeah on the shape so it doesn't
go too far
i'll do another one
right it's not 100 accurate but it will
do for now we just at the moment we want
to get it working as best as we can and
then later on uh we can go and do tweaks
because it's really important um
essentially
with doing something like a white box
you want to get something
into
the game as quickly as you can so that
you know other teams aren't waiting
on you to be able to so for example if
the environment artists wanted to place
this um in a scene or to create a puzzle
with it or something like that um
you'd want to get the functionality done
as soon as you can
um
just
be not
holding
really
so we can drag this in here to answer
the folks in in chat
yes
what you're seeing is lag from the
internet uh the uk is having a pretty
heavy storm right now and that's why
lewis's voice attenuates the way it does
sometimes and he's the one sharing so
that that is that's why your frame rate
looks like it does sometimes so uh and
also it's called the pyro proposition
because we're making a prop for the pyro
space stations and yeah i i just like
really bad crappy titles
because they amuse me
so don't read too much into it other
than that
yeah the prop for the pyro system is
really amazing like i had really a lot
of fun with what we
do they are really doing a pretty good
job concert artist ronda yeah like like
my art test
back in the day was i had to i i made
this
uh
these one-off shows called the wonderful
world of star citizen that i made
before and then like
i did that that was sort of my audition
and they're like can you make can you
make videos that are more professional
and with less funny haha in them and i'm
like no
and like all right we'll hire you anyway
i'm like cool
so it's always been a it's always been a
it's been a thing since day one
it's like no
always be yourself
you too
you told me i could be crappy i'm crappy
it's like all right
that's the thing as well you have to be
yourself why acting as someone you are
not no that's it's it's it's literally
one of my you know people ask
you know there's lots of reasons to like
your job and whatever but one of the
things that i like most about my job
probably the thing that i like most
about this job
is that they've never asked me to be
anything other than who i am
yeah sometimes they've made you know so
occasionally i get a suggestion like
could you be more
like this or whatever and i'm like not
really
that this is
it's it's you know sometimes the joke is
a little too
obtuse and just like i don't get it i'm
like yeah i know but i did and it made
me laugh so
worth it every time
sometimes i make things for an audience
of one
so essentially what just happened there
god gone i'll let you i'll let you know
i was i was gonna say just but perks is
to have weight on it and i was asking if
it was going to work ah yes
yeah so so two things happened um so
originally the template comes with four
wheels so obviously we don't have four
wheels unless we have three um so i
removed one of them and
the wheels at the front were quite big
by default so i've changed the sizes uh
down for those so these are a lot
smaller now um and also this back one uh
the size increased a bit
um and then we because we've got these
proxies on the front now and the weight
distribution is way better so
now when we we activate our physics
it's a lot better um
obviously stuff like this the wheel you
know
you can tweak these basically so that
the mesh isn't clipping with the floor
um
so for example here it's still a bit
dodge
but um
you know stuff we can all tweak later
the thing i'm interested in now
you see if it's worse with your hands
well actually i need to turn this off
let's see if this works now
surprise surprise
it's broken so i'm gonna go quickly
check
where it's gone wrong
jared is an on-air personality no that's
like 90 minutes of my job every week i
still got another
another 50 hours that's my actual job
the on-air stuff is like the bonus
what did you do louis
is it the right name for the for the
proxy
maybe it's just that that he doesn't
have the right name
uh the group should be the right name
where is
this is the fun part this is the this is
the most time consuming part exactly
interaction grips
i should be working
interesting
yeah i don't know it's not appearing so
this one i prepared earlier
which also oh
this could get spicy is it gonna do what
it did to me last stream no this one
works
so you might just press this one
this is what i set up earlier just so
that i ironed out any kinks with
with what was going on so
we could probably move this one because
you only got like 20 minutes left
yeah exactly so
so yeah that that totally went fine
this is totally not one that we made
earlier but it's all good
so
we're going to quickly drag this into
the trash
okay
guys we've talked about the frame rate
it's a screen share
across the world during a storm
yeah my window came in at any point
that's how bad it is
it's really bad right now in the uk
it's the worst come on
cool
so i'm just gonna quickly replace this
right let's start adding stuff
so
being my infinite wisdom i decided we're
going to add
we'll start off with the palette
now what's the brief for this because so
far we've only spent the time time
talking about physicalizing this palette
but what are you actually adding to it
what's the brief here what's the mandate
what are we trying to do
so so essentially we want to i believe
this is going to be used um you can use
it as an interactable but there's also
going to be some around levels with like
items on them
you can use this cover pretty much so um
essentially we want to create
a version that has a palette on with
some cargo on it so
what i'm going to do is i'm going to
start dragging
but the cargo isn't you know just a scu
box full of stuff it's
the this is like an npc's personal
belongings that they're yeah we just
want a load of random crap on it really
anyway
anyway um so yeah what the way the way
i'm gonna i've picked a few random items
uh these are obviously
gonna change because there's you know we
want to tell a story with this uh for
this first iteration it's just gonna be
some placeholder stuff so the first
thing we want
is gonna be a palette
because that gives us a bit more uh
room to
start placing stuff
so i've got a tool here basically lets
me move one helper
uh and it updates the position of the
mesh so i could do this and then
wait what am i doing
obviously i can do that but um i can
also
create
more nodes rotate them in whatever
direction i want
and put them
and if i hit update it then updates it
with all all the stuff so
it's a cool little way of like uh kind
of addressing
you know how you want something to be
and then instancing the meshes so that
you can make changes on a larger scale
so for example if we've got all these
placed like this
um in random orientations and we wanted
to change like a detail on the palette
we can just change one here and we just
hit update and it will it'll update
globally on everything so it's really
handy tool to have
so
now um i'm just going to drag
this over
and wax that there in the middle so we
have like the palette on the right place
uh and then what we're gonna go for next
what have we got this hierarchy is a
mess i'm really sorry i should have
cleaned this up
uh next we'll do the next biggest thing
which was this is an honest
demonstration of workflow
yeah i think it's really important as
well because i think a lot of people
come onto these like you know streams
i've seen streams before people come on
they they edit out all of the
the happy accidents and the mistakes and
and you don't get to see the
you know the
the process because it does take a long
time it does take a long time
oh come on it works always takes time
and so does yours
would it work update yeah
crisis of it
now you're going to same with the
generator
yeah so i'll add that
no that's not working
oh it is it's just not okay i just had
it hidden
basically i'm an idiot
cool
so add that on there uh i don't know
maybe maybe we have two
because we're adventurous
we'll even put a bit of rotation on it
whoa
i don't know why there we go
i use this little sidebar
to quickly i can display all the proxies
i can hide them uh the collision meshes
um i can change between
lots
this is a cool little tool i actually
use
uh what next
[Music]
[Laughter]
is a plush whale really going to provide
effective cover
this one
that's huge
is that the is that the right size
that's the big one that's the big one
that's bigger than one two sizes yeah
oh we to judge the size of the plush
whale come on that's that's not very
inclusive that's way bigger than the one
we shipped out recently
maybe uh i don't know
maybe it grow
because of silence
like i'm i'm fed up with my artist
already
it's close it just might have more
profanity in it
please i would like to come back again
okay hopefully this works
that's like my favorite tagline for our
team hopefully this works
i know
in an attempt to make the internet
run a bit smoother uh i disconnected
from the vpn again so
i need to learn how to disconnect from
perforce
but we'll wait
there we go object file oh no
it's all right it's just yeah see that
you can fix with the form
has eight degenerate faces
where's object five in the scene oh my
god
and then this is the part where max it's
trying to trying to do stuff
uh
did you all remove versus go now
yeah yeah i turned it off because it was
it was making everything that could be
white sticking time now yeah
i need to learn how to disconnect it
yeah uh brexit says i just realized we
don't currently have squashable objects
eddie from we we have we have soft body
physics
uh they just have to we just have to
choose to enable them for certain things
oh
wow
i mean it's a different it's a different
colored version uh it's a material but
it's because no like a tintable i guess
right
yeah maybe
so
then i'll buy now yeah
now we can stroll about with our
uh our new object
and we can add more so
in general what we do is uh when
we're creating this this this will be to
cover metrics so obviously we won't have
a giant plushie um to take cover behind
in a realistic scenario but we'd have
some you know maybe more variety of
stuff so if it's for pyro it could be
like scrap metal and like engine parts
and
bits from the station or you know a big
benny's vending machine it could be
anything really like it's
it's down to
the the story we're trying to create but
uh
put a benny's
make it
work oh
i've only got top secret ones
not the top secret one
no no no no
well here hold on i'll i'll turn the
screen shirt off you show me
here they can't see your screen show it
to me and i'll tell you whether you can
show it or not
what is it
let me get these they're looking at my
face right now instead of you so you can
show me let me see
i'm just trying to find the image
oh my god
i need to clean my files out
there's so much cursed stuff here so
i literally dumped everything it's uh
it's this one but the mesh for this one
that's all right
yeah yeah that's all right
all right
that was that was actually uh originally
uh that was actually part of a
citizencon and then it got cut
but only because of time only because of
time so we're clear on that one
all right
i'll do my best to get it in
we got 10 minutes we can do this 10
minutes
in advance
this
they could all say i was there
i fought for this one
yeah
i had a really long task and i was like
i really want to do this one next
because it
yeah
yeah i say you guys can sit here and try
to recreate it from the reflection of my
glasses but we're just going to show it
to you in a minute so you save yourself
the effort
i gotta go back on the vpn for one bit
load faster
there's too many polygons
i'm
this is the part where i take a coffee
break
it's the most minor inconvenience you go
for a coffee break
oh my god
what is that is that never before seen
prop okay i better be able to start i
swear corey comes back from holiday and
he's like why'd you let jared do that
why'd you let him
this is not allowed it's illegal
right i'm going to hit my magic copy
button
it's defending amazing
i love it i love it already
right you could remove those yeah
oh that wasn't the right button
i was like where's my root no
you put it up there
there we go
see this in this shape it doesn't really
look like anything they can't tell what
it is
ah this this is the thing
hopefully i submitted it correctly
but but but a bit of uh too late what i
was going to say
there we go oh this look i'll tell you
what this lighting doesn't do it justice
like yeah change it to can you change
the time of day change it to like night
time
i didn't remember how to do that i'm on
it i'm in the test lab at the moment i
can't
you can change the time of day in the
test level
i don't have the facilities for that
oh my god it's like
it's like a
where is it it's like a one button push
i can't remember what the button is
right now but you just it has uh it has
like five different preset pre-baked and
i just can't remember what the button is
for it
uh
it's all right it doesn't matter uh what
folks are seeing right here uh
so to explain it is uh
because some of the pyro space stations
are a bit older
uh you know they're old and abandoned
some of them go back uh
maybe even a hundred years uh
one of the tasks was to develop a what
what a big benny's machine look like
from
from
many many years ago years ago yeah yeah
so what you're seeing is like a classic
vintage retro
uh big betty's vending machine here you
can show them the concept
uh
yeah yeah so okay yes the lighting here
is a bit worked so let me show you the
content
you can even show your screenshot i
guess i'm thinking of the screenshot
yeah the thing that you just showed me
the thing that you just showed me when i
had it off you can show that
okay
because he also has a good screenshot
with
spyro station and it looks really very
good
that was the concept yeah
i've got one of i've got a good
screenshot of it in the game but i don't
know i can show that would you you can
can you okay here i'm gonna change the
camera so that i don't see anything else
but go ahead and bring it up yeah
okay
there we go okay yeah
yeah i'll go back there there you go
yeah so so that's it actually in the
game with proper lighting
and working yep without the dodgy screen
so yeah
essentially using those tools we can
create trolleys we can do different
variants of these so you know this could
be like a full height cover one for
example
uh you could do one that's like crouch
height
um
and yeah you could put it in any
orientation and
you can even walk this around now i'm
gonna say yeah try pushing it around see
if it works
you could even imagine to have like a
place that you need to go and you can
push it to just access it you know
secret spaces and stuff like this could
be fun
yeah i'd tip it over and kill somebody
with it
i wish i hadn't made the level so big i
would run it off the cliff
but yeah um
anyway this this asset
at the moment it's it's very basic
there's going to be more done to it it
obviously needs cleaning up like this
spring that i've made for it is is not
the right size it's clipping through
there's
stuff as well to get details and after
details
but the main thing when you're
submitting something like this is to get
all the collision working and uh just so
that it's in a position where you know
the level designers can then go in and
start integrating it and then what you
do is you slowly carry on developing the
asset until you reach uh final art on it
so
yeah yeah
that's uh that's trolley 101 players
uh can you can you bring up the the
battle trolley one more time
uh the battle trolley yeah bring out the
battle trailer one more time
all right all right folks so hold on
leave this up on the screen for a little
bit go where's it animated it's not
playing anymore
it was playing the door nope does my
mouse need to be over it i don't know
there it is there it is
okay so here
what what i want you to do folks
look at me this is my serious face
i want you to go to twitter i want you
to tag john crew
and i want you to be like hey john crew
we saw battle trolley on scl
uh when is it when is it coming to the
persistent universe
oh on every single like if you don't
have a twitter account go make a twitter
account
and then and then
create create this you can screen you
know i'm gonna put on the screen you can
screenshot it right now and screenshot
it right now again
and just
and just i wanna see
i want to see
at least
300 posts 300 posts
on john cruz twitter account say jared
said we could we could have the battle
trolley if we got the 300
posts
but that you have to tag it in there so
he gets the notification though if you
don't tag it it doesn't count
it has to like buzz his phone every time
it happens because i know he has
notifications on
so
so so so go to go to twitter
and and and tag john with a screenshot
of this
so that his phone keeps buzzing
he's going to be fuming
[Laughter]
he's just going to start like rolling
off his desk
all right uh you can stop the screen
share
awesome
all right
uh louis thomas thank you so much for
for uh hanging out uh
showing us a bit of your showing us a
bit of your workflow yes it's underscore
it's at underscore john crew on twitter
folks look in the chat look in the chat
right now if you're watching if you're
watching on youtube if you're watching
on youtube later uh somebody added to
the youtube uh comments so people can
find it it's at underscore john crew all
one word c-r-e-w-e
don't forget the e at the end um
lewis thomas again thank you so much for
hanging out with us at the end of the
week uh
that's all i got remember folks um
there is a free fly going on right now
uh so check that out uh there's a new uh
armor and stuff on the referral program
be sure you check that out
uh
and uh yeah we'll be back uh we'll we'll
be back uh next week with more isc and
seo i don't remember what's on either
one of them right now
because i'm in total travel mode right
now so i'm i'm space brained so uh
late everybody
was we don't do c universe more that was
the other show why don't you see
universe
every day every we do every day on the
props
he just waits and then he spotlights his
camera in the meeting and he goes we'll
see you around the verse
you guys are up in there and everyone on
the team
every guy on the team just like leaves
slowly and
sadly
we'd live before he says it
definitely yes
yeah i know it's still on
i was giving you bonus content
oh my gosh i was giving you bonus
content i know it was still on
they don't want us to go yet
do
do what i like
you
