## Transcript

hello everybody
welcome to another episode of star
citizen live game dev star cart racing
uh i'm the person who lost his regular
prescription sunglasses and
this is all i've got right now so i can
see the screen i'm jared huckabee hi
have you seen my glasses
i haven't
joining us on the show this week is
a a mr martin uh from the from the from
which which environment team are you on
you're on eu sandbox
i don't know what team are you on hi
um i'm on the sandbox 2 team you're on
eu sandbox too
yeah that that i mean really i mean
we're not going to try to throw eu
sandbox 1 under the bus but
sandbox 2 is better right
ah yeah totally
so uh uh uh martin
what is your title i forgot to ask
before the show i was too busy looking
for my glasses
hey i am an environment artist um
two
environment artists
and what does an environment auto artist
two do
um yeah like the title says i'm doing
environments like i'm modeling assets
i'm
texturing it i'm putting them into the
level and then i'm dressing levels with
the assets i and other artists created
and as folks may have seen on inside
star citizen last week uh when martin
had a little bit of time between tasks
uh he uh he
how did this happen would did you take
it upon yourself were you did nick come
over and be like hey you know i need you
to do this like how did the how did the
idea for this startup
um yeah basically nick came to me and he
asked me if i wanted to do to work on a
little side project um the expectations
were not really high because it was like
really not that much time for um
for the whole thing um and it was just
like hey maybe you have some time maybe
you want to try to build something in
this hall and i was like yeah sounds fun
so um we were just brainstorming a bit
um
and uh we came up with the goku track
because it's
um
yeah you can actually fit all the space
in this hall quite good
with not too many assets
so
that's how it happened
and these kind of things
happen quite often in game development
we saw i want to address some of the
comments we saw on the youtube and
spectrum and stuff afterwards um
game dev if you haven't if you've
watched everything that we've published
uh
at least in the eight years i've been
here i think
when we last counted it's something like
2300 videos
uh that that that i've made for star
citizen uh i hope you'll get a sense
that nothing is ever just the work of
one team it everything in star citizen
everything game development requires the
the work of this team working with this
team and this team and and has
prerequisites of of this team's work and
stuff like this and while there are
certain teams that are obviously the
lead in charge of this this is a this is
a project by you sandbox team uh what
happens often in gamedev is that some
things go faster than others uh it's
game development not game construction
as you're figuring things out as you're
fighting the bugs as you're fighting the
bugs to get your stuff made
sometimes you're left with you know
extra time here while you can't progress
to your next thing while somebody else
is working on them uh so
lots of different companies work with
that kind that phenomenon in different
ways uh one of the things that i think
is really awesome about here is we have
our kind of backlog our wish list of
tiny things like if we find the time if
we if we find the resources we
definitely want to throw this stuff in
and that's how things like
like the snake pit racetrack uh uh uh
from nemanja panic got in and how things
like uh our
buggy track racing uh from from martin
here does so what we're what are we
doing today
um so today we're building another race
track a smaller one
but uh with the same assets and um yeah
let's see how far we can get all right
so i'm going to start up the screen
share here there you go
so
yeah so
before we get started i do want to
remind folks that absolutely nothing in
star citizen can be made in an hour
uh
it's like i said not only does it take
the work of all these teams but it boy
we you know just
what you're going to see is going to be
a small demonstration of process uh kind
of an accelerated in certain places so
keep that in mind uh and with that
martin i'm gonna turn it over to you
it's your show
all right um so
what i did is i took another room from
the convention hall a smaller one so
hopefully we can make a
whole racetrack in um built in here
and um
i prepared it a little bit cleaned it up
put some branding on it so it looks nice
and
also i have all my modular assets
um on the side here i put them already
so so it's just quicker for me to just
grab them from here and place them in
the level
um i first what we're gonna do is we're
gonna place our roads um we try to make
it fun and kind of unique in a way
then we're going to put in some lights
um for example um
those railings have lights i already
placed them
so we will just put
once we have finished uh happy with the
road uh the track we just place all
those railings in then we're gonna get
some lights then we're gonna play some
of those um
checkpoint gates and spotlights i also
have a bigger spotlight if we need more
lights we can place them
everywhere
if it looks good then we can
um go into more details like placing
those uh
smaller props like those tires and and
this cone
which are also physical objects so when
we drive over it they will
fly away um
and also then we can um put in some more
dressing like those uh ground decals
this um
uh oil spots and stuff like that just to
spice it up a bit
um
yeah
so i think i will just start putting my
um track pieces which we're going to use
the most
inside my haul and then we can start
with it
yeah man have at it
i don't know if you know this but uh uh
uh one of the things i did to audition
for you know working here
was i took the original hanger module
you know back before arena commander was
out and then it was just a single player
hanger module and i actually uh built a
racetrack inside the the hanger module i
went in i got the cryengine sdk and i
pulled it apart and i made i connected
all four
hangers and and built a race track
within the the
hangers nice and i was doing youtube
videos the uh racing around the track
and they weren't getting many views
because
i just wasn't i wasn't i wasn't very
good at the youtube stuff
but uh uh but uh
uh event but i'm like i know how to get
it gonna get views i'll i'll i'll make
this i'll make this multiplayer so then
i went and got a a crisis two and and uh
the
and basically reverse engineered all of
the multi-player functionality out of
crisis 2 and put it into the hangar
module
and had the very first star citizen
multiplayer match of all time which was
me and a guy from australia who loaded
into my hangar and we raced around on
buggies
and that was literally my audition for
for cig i'm like i'm like look it's i
don't just talk and make videos i can
actually do this stuff and understand
what the stuff what these people are
doing you should hire me
that's cool
so
this this is a bit somebody reminded me
of it on twitter the other day like this
is where you got your start i'm like oh
yeah that's why i like picked up so much
awesome
um so
just to explain a little bit what i'm
doing i'm just connecting those pieces
as you can see
they um snap nicely together
most of the time
it can happen
that stuff like this is happening but
that's not a big issue um actually this
one is quite easy to fix
just had to change my
coordinate system
from white to white
from
worlds to local um so it follows this
direction you know the the 45 degree
direction
um
and um
what i
would like to do is to focus on this
inner area here you know so it's
surrounded by this um
orange carpet so
i don't have to cover that much
that much space sorry
and
also
um
yeah
how can we make it fun
i
think we should
already place some jumps in here
right
also if
the hall is too dark for you just um let
me know so i can um
yeah make it a little bit more brighter
so far so good uh of all the feedback
that we saw about the the isc segment
and we didn't we didn't show everything
in the racetrack we didn't show how you
started and load it in and and stuff
like that you know i have to leave some
things for for players to discover you
know once it hits ptu and stuff
but uh i think one of the biggest
surprises besides just how awesome it
was
uh
it was the verticality i think a lot of
people
uh when they first saw the the ads in uh
orizon uh kind of expected something
that was just flat
and
you know you know
like an old slot car you know race track
kind of thing but i think the the
verticality with the jumps and the dips
and stuff was
was really impressive to a lot of folks
yeah
we should also include it
in here that that was my way of subtly
trying to encourage you to include yeah
um
maybe we can
not just drive to a higher platform
where we can we can jump up onto it
i don't know if it works hey hey we're
good we're just trying to let's try
trying things do it
so
i mean how many times is the very first
version of a racetrack ever ever work
yeah
yeah i did so many racetracks just
figuring stuff out um also back then
when i did the racetrack i um
modeled those um track pieces parallel
to it because i didn't know how white
the track should be
um how tight the corner should be and
stuff like that because you know it's
just something
you never had grey cat racing in the
game so um
um yeah i just had to try it out and
it i had a lot of iterations and yeah
until it felt good it took a while
i i think there's
i think there's probably a
misperception a misconception if you
will
that
level design always and many times this
does but always starts out with like
drawing it out on paper and you know
laying it out and stuff like this i get
the sense uh from the limited time that
i've talked to you you didn't exactly
write all this out of paper before you
started messing with it am i right
nah especially for for the racetrack
it's like it's one thing to draw it on
paper actually i did it
but
you never know if it really is fun when
you play it
that's a whole nother thing
um
it
looks like i cannot jump high enough
but
you know what let me try to extend
the ramp a little bit
[Music]
so since
this is um
yeah uh
not a unique part it um
might look a little bit um
you know not perfect
but i hope the jump will work
and i like this
sometimes you have to be creative and
just try things kit bash some stuff
until it works
and then you can go polish it
ignore these
all right
and that's what i actually did i i
placed some things then i tested it
noticed oh it's not working tested
it again
did some new stuff
wow okay this is cool
works
i think once you drop that you should
you should stay at that little elevation
though
like build your way up and then like a
roller coaster like as you're looping
around like like spiral up and then
spiral down
yep inside of it
sounds good
is this a low gravity hanger i don't
know
no it's not
see
okay
now we have our elevated
track
um okay in general how should this track
look maybe like
something like an eight so we have this
overpass
we were driving on it right
could be cool and also we should add
more turns i think this
is kind of boring right now
yeah
so
no
do do do
uh euro trucker 24 says can a ground
vehicle make the best in show that's
entirely up to you
i mean i don't know the rules
but
i mean
it's people power
um
that's fine
all right
your trigger always says i always
thought it was i mean
if you can find somewhere where it says
that i mean i don't know you're a
trucker that's the problem i'm saying i
don't know unless you can find somewhere
where it's expressly says that i don't
know why anybody would think that
but again i don't know maybe it is maybe
it is only flyable ships only but i'm
saying look at the website read the text
see if that's what it says you don't
have to wonder
the information is out there
all right
um
i
added a few turns um
again test it see if it's fun
yeah jumping game zerg master says i
mean it's called ship showdown yeah but
that's because we like alliteration
it's it's i mean vehicle showdown
doesn't doesn't quite roll off the
tongue the same way you know what i'm
saying
it's like they may all be members of the
ship team but they also work on ground
vehicles too so
nice oh love the bank there
all right
love the bank coming out of the oh
yeah that's fine i it just jumped off
and whip showdown
that's totally fine that was intended
um
all right so far i think it's it's okay
um
maybe this piece is a bit too long um
let's shorten it a bit and add a few
more turns
on the upper area
actually what we also could do at some
point um once we have the track
add some obstacles on the track
um that could be also fun for example
the tires so you have to dodge them
maybe
just remind me later when when i forget
it again
yep euro trucker went and read and said
ship showdown is a month-long
multi-phase aerospace smackdown where
you decide the best ship slash vehicle
in the verse yeah see
the power of reading
i was just reading an article
about how
jen's ears
like use tik tok and
like 40 percent of all gen zeros use
tick tock and uh instagram for search
like information search
because they'd rather see small videos
with the information than have to read
i was just like
i i think i'm technically a
elder millennial i think that's that's
the new classification for me and i'm
like i would i would much
i'm the guy who makes all the videos but
i would much rather read stuff
personally
it's one of the great contradictions of
my life
i see a lot of people talking about
voting for the ptv i mean you can you
can do that don't get me wrong
but
i mean
there are a lot of
there are a lot of great ships out there
that you know personally if i were
allowed to vote
that you know like i i'd i'd rather see
new options for
for
a couple like like my daily drivers like
like the hammerhead like for me
personally i adore the hammerhead i i i
have a hard time not voting for the
hammerhead every single year and just
getting as many many paints
uh for the hammerhead as possible that's
me
personally
like if the genesis starliner were out
there'd be no force on earth that could
make me vote for something other than
the genesis starliner
i mean i i i get the meme boats i get i
get the the ptv meme vote and the the
the i think there's there's a mule
a faction for meme vote out there but
i don't know
mean things fun every once in a while
but
i think you only get the opportunity
once a year
me personally i'd get pains for the
the stuff i'm actually out there using
every day
but that's me
i also like to read so i'm weird
no reading is fine
i like where this is going i like where
this is going mine
right
all right now we have to connect it
somehow yeah the 45 after the jump is a
really nice touch
yeah
actually let's just
go down again
um
hmm
all right
uh jared aren't you generation x yes but
you know every time they they do these
things they they come into like sub
divisions and whatever i uh in the
larger divisions i'm generation x but
then they came up with this subdivision
that's like
a four year period where it's just
coming out of generation x and uh
whatever the heck was after that they
called it
uh uh
what i call elder millennials it's
basically people who were born when star
wars was coming out
like if you were born when star wars was
coming out it like fundamentally changed
your dna and you're not quite you're not
quite gen x anymore and you're
definitely not a millennial it's it's
this it's the star wars generation and
that they call it elder millennial now
or xenial xenon was another thing senile
sounds like
i don't know xenial sounds like
something that they they got from a
final fantasy video game or something
i'm not a sociologist i don't make the
rules
meh almost fits
um
no problem
uh senesei 416 says is this star citizen
or a racing game
why can't it be both
who wants to put star citizen in a box
not me but that's the cool thing about
star citizen right that you cannot do
all this crazy
it's a sandbox
that looks perfect martin good job
thank you ship it
come on
you don't notice it hey hey hey
hey you only got an hour i understand
man you gotta do what you gotta do yeah
you know what that's that's for cleaning
up later on
see there's some of my gen xers
understanding a dirty dancing reference
good job nighthawk
we need an in real life version of this
race track in the manchester studio
new manchester studio is pretty big but
we're already pushing some space limits
i'm not sure we got room for a
for uh
our track just yet
we need to we we need another floor you
got to talk somebody into getting
another floor of the building
another floor
well if we're going to fit it if we're
going to fit a
a a a go-kart track in the in the office
yeah sure why not let's go for it maybe
you can also have one in the frankfurt
studio right
all right now i have the whole track
let's see if
if it's fun if it works
that's not the whole track we're only
halfway through
yeah we're gonna go you you raise this
then we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna
get crazy we gotta go we gotta go up
another level
yeah sure we can go crazy
just love the 45 coming out of the jump
big fan of that
all right all right so as your art
director for this hour i went
i'm going to tell you where we break
watch keep racing
oh sorry i already pressed it all right
let me jump back into the game
no problem
this is too nice and professional we're
gonna we're gonna make this really dumb
here
i gotta i got a reputation to keep
martin
all right
i'll go around here it's all good
all right so we're going to jump up here
make this turn
come around hard turn
hard turn
and then right here stop
come on now now come on back back up
all right so you see where it
it it curves down here
we're going to go we're going to go up
here
up again we're going to go up again for
a third
level for a third level all right crazy
yeah sure
did they mention where it's going to be
yet uh the the
the racetrack that you saw in isc last
week uh ruby that's an origin that's in
the origin convention center this is
just us
uh messing around in a side room
they've let me put many things in the
game i don't think this will be one of
them
like i've named six spaceships
and
a whole bunch of the subscriber stuff
for like two years is you know started
from my ideas and stuff like that but i
don't i think asking for
the the the
monster a racetrack we're about to make
right now it's probably a bit too much
uh can we get enough speed for a loop uh
that was we discussed that on isc uh
last week that the gray cat as it's
currently tuned uh isn't quite fast
enough
for uh
all right
so yeah so so stay at this so stay at
this elevation and come and come around
we're not we're not going down yet no no
down yet
no down no no down yet man
all right martin did not what do you
want me to do martin did not know what
he was getting into so so erase that so
so so
so go straight forward and then come
make your next turn like go all the way
to the end like you're doing just just
straight forward for a bit
uh do do do do a curve
uh do you have curves on both sides like
like a straight like a straight away
with a curve
with a bend
you know it curves up like the 45s you
have a straightaway with a 45
uh i don't know what you mean uh okay
you know how the the side of the track
can bend up to a 45 degree angle i think
it's maybe it's actually 30 degree
those ones like that yeah do you have a
straightaway with one of those
um yeah
actually it's
um where have it
where are they
like those guys
and then i just place two of them next
to each other
and that that'll create a straight away
yep
page
you can get rid of those
the pieces that are there you can just
delete them we're not gonna use
those yeah get rid of that guy
get rid of that guy i push them to the
side for now maybe maybe i'm gonna use
the tire all right so put that in there
and then
yep and now zig zag back the other way
no no instead of making the turn we're
just gonna zigzag a little bit so that
one just curved to the left now curve
back to the right
all right we're getting janky here
doesn't fit that good but
okay that's fine for now i can fix it
later
right and back again all right now you
got you got an extra piece in there
don't come back one piece
come back one p oh no no just selection
come back a piece
come back a piece
come back a piece
what what yeah come back
retrace your steps
right back one more
that one get rid of that one
wait this one yeah get rid of that one
yeah okay okay
okay there i think two pieces on top of
each other sorry
um yep okay just clean it up
okay now that piece that's right there
get rid of it
all right no that's good i'm sorry yeah
now now you alright undo that
this is why i'm not an art director
undo bring it back
yep
and now
keep that curve
i can keep that curving to the right and
continue the curve
it was more it was a more pronounced
curve than i was expecting
and then add one more
the same direction
yep
and now
add
and now start bending back the other
direction
oh god yep this is this is a dead man's
curve this is a dead man's curse
three levels up this is dead man's curve
we're gonna see some people falling off
there you go
do you want me to do
yep
and then come back and continue until
we're back on the straightaway
you got it you got it you get you're
getting my crazy you're getting my crazy
okay and now and now a straight piece
little straight piece
yep you know what comes next martin
uh no i don't we go up again
give me a jump you know that at some
point we we have to get down again right
i know
we're only halfway through
so give me another jump up give me
another jump up
a jump up all right let's just copy this
one
man this is martin's first crazy
um
you know what
like this
um
okay at some point we have a roof right
yeah this is as high as we're going this
is the size we're going okay
so let's build a spill say we need a
landing someplace for it to land
um
we gonna need a ramp like this
just for referencing the height how high
i can get go
um
yo
my snapping was off that's bad
all right
and i guess you want a straight piece
do we have to slope down
right there oh yeah did just give me
another flat piece just like just land
on the flat piece
we can go with this one
and then
give me another flat piece
i'm about to turn it over to you because
your challenge will be to figure out how
to get back down after we do this yeah
so i'm about to hand it back over to you
thank you
um
now we're gonna okay this is not a
challenge but
um
you know what actually i should test it
first before i let's test it and see if
we can get up there and at this point
now you have to figure out how to get it
back down
that'll be your challenge
nice awesome thank you very much jared
more pickier than cr heck no
yeah this sounds dismissive thank you
[Music]
[Music]
i don't know what the great cat sounds
like anymore it's been too long dead
man's curve don't fall don't fall don't
fall it's not that hard to be honest
okay
now we are top yeah so yeah so now now
it's all you
now it's all you now you got to figure
out how to get back down
and connect it all
awesome okay yeah 25 minutes yeah 25
minutes this is your challenge that's
fine you can't change anything else
like you have to keep what's there
and now you have to connect to it
all right
to be honest
that shouldn't be too hard i think i
would just make a turn here maybe add
some more curves to it and then go down
here at the side
and then connect it here
so that's the idea let's see how it
works
now the exciting thing would be to go
down in the middle of the track
oh man
don't make me do this
i'm just saying that would be the baller
the baller thing would be good to go
down through the middle
yeah i'm excited
martin's never going to come back on scl
ever again
oh that's a big curve
i like it i like it
maybe there shouldn't be any railings on
top just
so
you really get punished when you fall
down
[Music]
right that's what you like
the this is rainbow road baby
is starting to look like a mighty mouse
roller coaster
yeah it is i cannot deny that kid
hercules
cannot deny it
nor would i want to
all right now we have to get down like
um a lot
yeah
um
i placed this one piece yet this side no
i need this one i think
it's basically playing lego kind of yeah
well i didn't i i actually just recently
discovered the joy of lego i had never
had lego as a kid
uh until until we did this uh cherry
live stream
event
last month uh when i had what i had with
were these uh
fisher-price
building
thing called construx that came in a big
bright orange uh briefcase
and uh i actually had it i actually had
a set of constructs with me during the
charity livestream and one of the
builders challenges was uh
jared's pain
and if they had drawn one i was going to
get up from the desk and bring them my
personal collection of constructs and
force them to stop using lego and start
building with constructs but nobody
nobody drew it
yeah that's that's wrong lego is just
the best
i think it's pretty good
but now i want to take the uh i want to
take the uh orange construction case for
my construct so i'm going to get like a
foam insert and turn into a laptop case
all right i don't know if
this will work so um
oh that's great i
think that would just fall off the
stairs
let's jump in and try
we are going to need to figure out where
the starting point is
yeah
it would make sense to have it like
let me drive there like here
somewhere you know um i have to starting
position block maybe we can integrate it
somehow yeah um
but yeah let's um finish the racetrack
first
okay new
that's a cool jump still
i mean usually i would
um try to make it kinda realistic you
know i'm having supports um supporting
the
uh
racetrack the upper
floor um racetrack
but right now i don't even know how to
add supports in here because it's just
crazy
let's grab left racetrack
all right remember we got grab left
whoop technology
okay i don't know that was kind of
meh
all right
hey you just need some zigzaggy
to get to get you connected
yeah but but i'm not happy with this
part it feels kind of you don't have
control at all over your car right so
maybe i should one drop and then a
straight and then a turn and then
another drop and you know
yeah
so man you could do this could since
it's a you know inside a convention
center these could be uh hanging
supports
the track could be suspended from the
ceiling ooh yeah right
i like that idea
sounds good good job don't please
good idea
but i don't have the assets for it so no
no sorry not going to happen today
we'll use grav love today
and then
like
the the health and safety department
will make us
ceiling supports later
alright
uh can you take a dragonfly on the track
uh
the tracks are really scaled and built
for
the gray cat and stuff like this it's
it's
remember this this is this is btr buggy
track racing it's not really
built for the other vehicles
there would be all kinds of other
additional
considerations that would need to be
taken in
it's not to say there won't be some kind
of you know dragonfly racing in the
future it's just
that not all things can be all things
and this is this is this is for grey cat
ptvs
oh it looks crazy but i like it yes it's
cool something
different all right so so you wanted to
integrate your starting
yeah let's take it
um
yeah
might not look perfect because
um
it's not connecting
that well
but who cares
no
maybe i should know what what if you
should play that piece
replace that straight piece with the
launch there
yeah that guy yeah that guy right there
if you replace that piece right there
yeah no because you have those bumps
here
um
[Music]
you know what
i will just place it
here for now
i had to turn to it
like this
and then add another straight piece to
connect it
you're still gonna have to bump um
because you know i need a we
need another piece something like
this one but
i have
um yeah here this
ramp so um because for the other
racetrack i needed it
so it's a kind of unique piece
maybe i shouldn't have done that no yeah
you use that replace the straightaway
with that guy and then elevate the
the the gray cat the the the launch pad
yeah
yeah it could also work
we're not up we're already using grab
live
yeah just yeah there you go
um
can't you hear the grav left
[Music]
yeah i can hear it
all right yeah awesome
now let's put our grey cat
to the starting position
and this is why race tracks take longer
than one hour
wait okay so we don't have that much
time anymore to to
build in
all the cool
railings and and gates and stuff
but that's fine still got 15 minutes
yeah
no worries i can do everything
all right let's see
[Music]
i wonder if zoom would share the sound
i have to turn off in the engine anyway
because at some points it was just
you know i couldn't hear it again
[Music]
cool
you know
all right all right
that's uh
still a bad
thing a different ground vehicle and try
it with a different ground vehicle let's
demonstrate what we were just talking
about about how these tracks are really
built for a grey cat
let's see what happens if we
martin it's just like none of the
they keep changing the deal
they've altered the deal
which one uh let's try the meal
which one is it uh dragon
this one is this one let me try
oh my
gosh i say save your work
yeah um maybe i should say
this is not a bad thing to do
all right
well
now it can't be a hover guys it's
fundamental differences in
wheeled vehicles versus it's in the
front
cycling is definitely too wide
cyclone's huge compared
yeah
wow it's got some zip to it look at it
this thing is fast yeah
and
the turn radius is like really high
what now it's dead
no no no no
yeah
yeah see it changes the whole philosophy
that's that's what we're talking about
it's like you design a race track for a
very specific vehicle
yeah you start you start allowing other
vehicles on this and all the tuning
goes out the window
come on i'm fine
you do you're doing much better than i
thought that you
thought you would i thought i was gonna
have to apologize after the show no
you're doing all right
yeah it's
it's doable kinda but you know
i cannot go full speed
because it would just fly off every
curve but but but but you know what
you know what's awesome about the mule
speed though
remember tell me remember that loop that
you made
oh
yes she got distracted by that i started
thinking about the loop it sounds like
[Laughter]
let's go see if the mule can do the loop
i think it can
it was
yeah that's um
let's see where can i
put it in
oh
you're gonna have to get like a running
start
maybe somewhere here
no
okay now i will break the the the track
a bit but
i think it's worth it
remember the loop was built for the grey
cat it was built to try to accommodate
the gray cat and whatnot so this is
this this is not
as intended
martin is a professional and i am a
clown and i am a clown
and i i'm forcing martin to be a clown
yeah it's fun to be a clown it's awesome
all right
that is a steep
oh because you're meant to go out one
all right so i'm looking at the outway
here that's that's where you come out of
it there you go all right
just
just so we can try
this is kind of sad
all right
okay i
let me go back again
i'll see you driving a third person
oh
wasn't that bad
try it in first person where you have
like more control better better control
all right
um but first let me go back again
first person universe
okay
kinda like this right
i don't see anything
i mean
excellent
but it
has enough enough speed so so i can make
it work i just need more time for for
the
uh loop yeah
and have to adjust it a bit
uh well maybe maybe
ma maybe uh
maybe area 18 needs some uh uh meal
track racing
yeah i'm a big fan of it
all right no
try again
yeah
almost almost
it was worth it perfect try so let's put
it back
we did science
we did science yeah
all right awesome cool now
i think i want to add some lights sure
just to
make it look a bit better
fantastic already
right so okay that's it with lights
that's it
um yeah
can i add a few more of those guys yeah
i i think if i'm allowed to speak for
the community here i think the lighting
was one of the most impressive aspects
of the
of the track that you made for the next
patch it's
the
you know
contrasting by the way if you're
watching this right now and you haven't
watched the isc segment with the actual
track an actual demonstration of what
martin's talent and skill can do please
go and watch that because this is this
is me making him a clown but go see the
stuff that he actually made
with with the different sections
and the colored lights for all the
different sections it is
a work of art like like it is you just
you just watch it you just like look at
it and it is it is a beautiful track
yeah for the lights i get to say i did
the first lighting pass on it like a
really rough lighting pass and then um
the lighting team took over and made it
look really good because i'm no lighting
artists and i'm kind of bad with lights
as you can see you know this is like
look at this i did light um
so um yeah usually
more professional people are doing this
yeah
shout out to chris campbell and his team
yep
yeah it's kind of hard to light the
upper area because you know all my
lights
on the floor need a floor
um
but actually
where is
isn't that working
oops so
this is how the railing looks with the
light
i think it's pretty cool when you drive
see you you get more sense of speed oh
yeah those lights
really does it i forget what i said
about no railing that is that is very
cool
yeah it looks really cool um
but you know setting up light is
it takes a lot of time actually because
also i have now my lights bleeding
through the
road
which can be also fixed but it takes
time like i said so so i won't do that
um
but yeah i will just add a few more of
them of them because it looks nice
why not
awesome lighting is done
not quite
cool
all right
look at that
not bad for an hour
well actually it was more like 45
minutes because
i derailed you
but yeah it's pretty good nice okay
can we drive it the last time yeah drive
it in first person we haven't seen it in
first person yet
i cannot go up there
i'm a really bad driver in first person
so
don't expect me to make oh that's like
yourself short you're a bad driver
period
[Music]
those railings do so much
yeah right
good call on the railings oh my god no
no no no no no no no
aren't you ruined
fire fire
somebody's on fire
okay and thus ended the story of martin
mills
uh no that's that's good um before we go
you uh you wanna sit on the racetrack uh
one of the racetracks i made like
almost a decade ago
star citizen yeah hold on
let me uh let me do this
i've never i should maybe i've figured
out how to do this before all right so
i'm gonna switch back to yes
and i'm gonna do this over here
and then i'm gonna screen share with you
let's see if this works
i'll optimize for video clip so that you
can see it
uh do you see my screen share now
i do all right hold on
and then if i do this
hold on this play
this is really old
it's said that the test of a man's
courage is how he performs in the face
of danger to meet these challenges see i
made like a hologram racetrack
oh nicer
please don't judge these please don't
judge the voiceover if that includes
yourself
well robot industries is proud to bring
to you the grey cat 6000 su-x
covered from head to toe with a bunch of
crap you could find anywhere else but
won't the great cat6000su x is a
modern-day testament to the virtues of
excess first and foremost every 6 000 su
x comes with an automated drive all
right we're not going to watch the whole
thing but
yeah but that that but it's amazing yeah
very very vertical uh very vertical and
