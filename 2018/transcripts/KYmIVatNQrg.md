## Transcript

greeting citizens and welcome to another
edition of reverse the verse live the
only weekly star citizen live stream
where you can help guide the direction
of star citizen's development as we
explore what features you most want us
to focus on in the coming months I'm
your host Content Manager jared huckaby
go now
maybe I buried the lede a little bit
there so let's go over that again after
every major release of star citizen the
teams around here and around the world
I've always gone into what we call a
review phase where we examine what
worked what could have gone better
what exceeded our expectations and
perhaps most importantly what your
responses were to the content this
evaluation is an important step after
every release that allows us to focus
our efforts and ensure you the most
efficient development process we can
with the upcoming release of star
citizen alpha 3.1 and the 3.2 looming on
the horizon and in our continuing
efforts to involve the star citizen
community in every aspect of our game
development we wanted to try something
new to that end on the show today we've
got founder and chief executive officer
chris roberts who will discuss a new
alpha 3.2 feature survey we're launching
later today but before we get to that
let's check out the Week in Review
now last Friday we had Jim Martin on the
show to talk about his career in science
fiction fandom and work on some of star
citizen's early a spaceship designs it's
always a blast to chat with Jim and it's
in the chance to showcase his
contribution to the project was a fun
walk down memory lane to some of star
citizen's earliest milestones if you
haven't seen it it's available now up on
YouTube Monday brought with another all
new episode of our weekly question and
answer series calling all depths this
week with answers to backer voted
questions like climbing cliffs and rock
faces while on foot the real-time
tracking of market commodities evie a
between ships of high velocity switching
between 2d and 3d radar types and the
future of a war in the persistent
universe remember you can submit your
questions for consideration each and
every week in the thread up on spectrum
and don't forget to vote Tuesday is
Laura day in the star citizen universe
and this week brought with it the first
featuring our newly revealed Aegis
Vulcan refueling repairing and rearming
ship it's a fun read and our first
glance at what an experienced as a
Vulcan operator might be like in the
persistent universe you can find that in
all our lower stories up on the Roberts
space industries comm website now
Wednesday we had the foot we had a
couple folks at the games development
conference in San Francisco where
visitors could experience the game on
the show floor and our own Shawn Tracy
gave a presentation on how star citizen
works with Intel's new octane technology
while yesterday brought with it the
latest episode of around the verse with
a project update and a series of
features focused on the work of our
audio team now I'm going to recommend
wearing headphones when you watch this
one because it's always a delight when
we can lend an ear to the amazing work
our audio team is doing to bring the
star citizen universe to life now with
that we're gonna take a real short break
and when we return we'll be sitting down
with chris roberts to discuss the alfa
3.2 feature survey that will be
launching later today and how you can
influence the direction of star
citizen's development by casting your
vote stay tuned we'll be right back
[Music]
jelena lost all my cargo back on you
love Nana all my you we see on the love
Nana it stored my ship for me on your
love can't get it back from Zelda oh you
love poking some cargo they said to me
sell it and double your a you will see
oh oh we're not there thinking it would
be easy mean my way over to our court my
knee I was like filled up for my cargo
with what I could buy of Barrow and I
was like
oh I made it I'll pass that move and a
server crashed oh no no no no no last on
my car go back on your love Nana
oh my you we see on your love Nana
it's toward my ship for me on your luck
can't get it back from yellow or your
love oh oh oh na na can't get it back
from yellow
[Music]
alright that was of course yellow yellow
yellow yellow which I can never say
appropriately I know we showcased that
before but it was stuck in my head
earlier this week and I figured if I
have to separate through it again
so do you joining us on the show this
week my boss
chris Roberts how you doing it I'm doing
good Jared okay welcome back I'm doing
well
22 twice on reverse the first in a year
that's a personal record for us yeah you
know it's only much still it's only
March alright
so alpha 3.0 3.0 on live now alpha 3.1
on PTU two subscribers and concierge
members and hopefully going a little
wider the Cathy and evocati and alpha
3.2 on the horizon how are things pretty
good so you know this is the first of
our quarterly releases and I have to say
that things are tracking really well I
know there was a fair amount of
skepticism out there but you know we're
pretty confident that we're gonna make
the 3-1 release I'll burn down the
tracks exactly to the date we're looking
for and everything of course is always a
couple of last-minute things like I
could I could have just messed up there
but now we're feeling good I think we're
going to have a strong PTU release today
or tomorrow we've we've put a lot of
work into the telemetry we still got
more work to do but in terms of us being
able to look at the performance both our
hang servers and on clients and also on
clients out in the wild so you know sort
of our ever catty members can do a
capture and then we can look at exactly
what was happening on their machine and
it's really useful because for us in our
QA environment we don't see a lot of the
stuff that happens out in the wild
there's a obviously we've only I mean
we've got a pretty big QA department
it's just under 70 people but still
they're not gonna do the same thing that
thousands of backers do and all the
crazy stuff and so having the data that
we can just automatically
so like we've put stuff in that if the
server starts to dip below a certain
frame rate it automatically just starts
capturing a few seconds of the
performance and then we can take a look
and see where the times been spent in
the routine is the same on that same on
the clients so that's helping a lot
we're building some more telemetry in
terms of various sort of things that
people do so we can sort of see and what
people are doing in the game and how
it's working so that's been sort of a
behind-the-scenes effort that we've been
working on and I think that's you know
helping with our ongoing performance
enhancements so 3 1 is definitely
performing better than 3 zero and you
know that's going to continue on as we
work on some of our more long-term
things we've talked about which you know
the object container streaming will help
with sort of memory we've got
asynchronous warning that we're getting
closer to have working properly it's
it's quite complicated to get working
because the game wasn't built it was
just built to create things on the main
thread and so you know people program
things assuming they can touch anything
at any one time which you can't do when
you're on multiple threads so and it's
such a big codebase that it requires a
lot to retrofit it and/or change things
out refactor them to be a new thing so
but all those things will make you know
like so for instance you play and some
AI spawning right now there'll be a
hitch because they have to load in and
there's a stall on the main thread until
everything's load in but long term that
will go away because I'll just sort of
valve loading the background when
they're ready the main thread will be
notified and then BAM that we turned on
so we're so we're putting all these
things in place so I'm feeling really
quite good about it we've we've added
some new features like the service
beacons stuff there's been a lot of this
sort of UI improvement and polishes I
think people noted and little things
like the you know procedural ground you
know sort of following they want you
know I've noticed quite a few people
posting videos and liking that which is
good and we've tried to work in some
things to you know improve like
interdiction and stuff like that and so
generally it's going pretty well it'd be
our first one and I know we've got a
the belief or the trust of everyone that
you know we say okay we're doing
quarterly we actually do coolies so this
one will be a good step the next one
won't be a good step but so it's going
good but you know the one of the reasons
why we're doing this show here because
we've you know the best way to do this
is as we've planned out a road map but
obviously you sort of check-in where you
are when you sort of get your release
out okay like this is what I'm going to
do four three two that's what we're
gonna do two three three before other
things that we want to fix or change
that we didn't foresee when we first did
this road mapping you know are the
things that we want to address for
quality of life or things we could do in
the game to make the game play right now
feel better because ultimately I mean
you know the amount of functionality
that we have actually in the game right
now if it all works together and works
well is more than a lot of release games
I mean Co thieves just came out and you
know we have like more variety of
missions hell of a lot more ships a
bunch more stuff that you can do and a
lot more area to play in but you know
they spend a lot of time polishing some
of their their basic stuff I know people
complain they still want more features
in that because I think that's generally
gamers were like I want more I want more
all the time but you know we've been
talking internally about you know star
citizen is it's not a sprint it's a sort
of longs America yeah it's very yes more
than a marathon it's like you know a
walk around the world but yeah you know
there's definitely things that in terms
of the gameplay if we work on a fixed
you know they perform this is obviously
one but just being able to play with
your friends and and get together easily
with them you know some of the stuff
that comes to the multi-crew ships that
we haven't finished off properly yet you
know i think the base gameplay can be a
lot of fun because it's kind of a fun
sandbox so we've been discussing about
maybe or not maybe definitely putting a
little more focus in some of the
near-term
kind of features or improvement at the
features as opposed to always focusing
on like the next big feature we're
trying to get in because you know if you
looked at 3-0 we put a vast amount of
things into it but we didn't spend
enough time making sure the base stuff
was working well so what you had was a
whole bunch of new features but a lot of
stuff that used to work into stick so
before that ended up not being as good
I'll be broken and so we've been fixing
a bunch of that and three one but we
still got more to do so you know we've
got things that we want to address and
you know the you know how it feels when
you fly around we're not we're not you
know the ifcs and the flight model still
has a bunch of work we want to do you
know the feel of fps moving around again
same stuff so you know it's a so long
term slug so we've sort of right now
we're taking a look at it going ok what
what four three two that we didn't
foresee that maybe we want to spend some
time working on and you know and then
just sort of reassess some of the stuff
that we're doing four three two and then
maybe move a couple of the bigger things
off to three three so we have more time
to do some sort of quality of life or
kind of fixes or improvements to systems
right now so that's the phase we're out
this is what we'll do every single we
sort of do it as we're coming up to the
release we're assessing it just to make
sure all the teams are aligned you know
our new production process is working
really well we've you know we've
factored in to sort of a much more sort
of team-based agile scrum and sort of
velocity in terms of fixes and
and resolving issues is much much better
I mean with I think resolved something
like 8,000 during 3.1 I can't cramming
around but I yeah this is right and then
Dennis and I think it was like 15,000
for the whole of 3.0 which was basically
a year you know so and our velocity is
you know 120 issues resolved a day
versus the 30 or even 20 that we had
during 3-0 so I think the teams working
together because we we really work to
try to put everyone together not like
here's the program as his designers it's
like okay you know your vehicle feature
team one your vehicle feature team two
your gameplay team and you've got the
designers and the engineers and the
artists and we're actually putting them
all together and we're trying to
collocate people so the teams are sort
of oriented in the various Studios we're
not having them spread between time
zones as much as we used to and I think
it sort of really helped in the
turnaround and also the energy in the
morale of the team so it's so generally
we're you know it's early days but we're
feeling pretty good about kind of the
velocity and trajectory we're going to
do so that's why we're sitting here and
we thought you know the discussion I had
with my brother Aaron who was just out
here and unfortunately he got on a plane
yesterday evening otherwise I would have
put him in is that you know we were we
were talking about yeah the quality of
life issues
you know perhaps push back a couple of
sort of the the bigger feature stuff so
we can do that but if we're doing that
why don't we ask you guys why don't we
see what it what's interesting to you
because it's it's always you know for us
we have our ideas but you know there's
hundreds of thousands of you guys out
there and I think in terms of you know
what is more interesting one of the
things that you want to do or you know I
still remember back in the very early
days when we did our survey of what
profession people would be interested in
and you know of course I'm just always
thinking well you because you know most
space sim games have been very combat
oriented so you're thinking okay it's
you know being a pirate or a murse
or maybe even a trader but you know I
think it was something like 70% of the
people wanted to be explorers right so
that was a surprise but that's cool and
then we're like okay well we need to put
gameplay to allow you to do that and you
know it did kind of affect sort of where
we went so I mean we went a different
way than say something like a leap or a
no man's sky where they sort of
procedurally darian but we one of the
reasons why we went with the procedural
tech to build the world's - the level of
detail we did was we thought that sort
of micro exploring this you know like
that idea of getting landfill on a
planet and you know discovering the
mountain or the lake or really getting
into the detail would be something that
we great so we're still working towards
realizing that but you can already see
you know it with three moons that we
have around Crusader and Delamar and you
know in our upcoming releases it's
obviously going to get bigger and wider
but you know that sort of effected
because you're thinking about okay yeah
like we want people to sort of be
tactile and get out there and explore
and so so yeah we thought it would be
really useful to have a discussion about
things that we've identified that we
want to improve for the immediate
experience and then also get some
feedback of sort of the bigger long-term
professions
what's interesting or what's the most
important you guys my name's already
been in progress it started at the
beginning of this year I know in our
roadmap it says scheduled but it's
actually being in progress it should be
that should be changing in the next the
next roadmap I don't know if will be
this Friday but the one afterwards but
we've been working on that that has a
lot of infrastructure issues in terms of
making sure the resources are mapped on
the planets and we can persist them
across instances and we can generate it
and handle all the stuff so we're making
very good progress on that and it's I
think it's going to be a very cool
feature that people be really happy with
so that's that's that's definitely three
mm but in terms of some of the other
ones yeah we would like to know
priorities because if we're going to add
some stuff - three - it's a zero sum
game we're gonna have to shift some
other stuff out so yeah what's more
interesting you know is is you know
repair more interesting than Salvage is
more interesting than refueling those
kind of
so this is one of the unique challenges
that star susan has is that we are
operating a live game environment in the
middle of our game development yes so
that was a massive challenge yes so so
some of what we're going to talk about
today is is that balancing act between
adding new features and going back and
revisiting old ones and Britain and
making them better making them more
user-friendly making them more enjoyable
because at the end of the day it's a
video game
the games are supposed to be fun to play
and whatnot so to that end we are
launching later today our alpha 3.2
feature survey you're gonna see that up
on the robert space industry comm
website it will be a survey for backers
Souto so it will only be available to
backer so if you do go to this thing and
it doesn't let you do anything that's
probably because you're either not
logged in or you know a backer you
should consider the movie exactly and
get any happier voice for you but when
the feature Survey launches today
you already said we're gonna talk a
little talk a little bit about big
profession based features like Salvage
mining or Salvage and repair and
revealing but a lot of it is is is
quality of life stuff is the kind of
things that will make playing the game
easier to play with your friends
my dad's been asking me hey so I'm not
even gonna to play star citizen and like
like but not what if we add if we had if
we had some of these features I'm not
gonna have an excuse anymore I'm gonna
have to play the game with my dad so
careful you vote but let's go ahead and
talk talk about some of these features
we have now week now we can show you
what the survey is gonna look like i JJ
want you to bring that up there alright
so we've got this so we'll then this
goes live later today you'll see your
star sis and alpha 3 point to feature
survey we've got a little preamble
pretty much a much shorter version of
what Chris just did so we'll go ahead
and skip that past that and some of the
feature improvements that we're we're
gonna be discussing for the survey this
the this this four three two is uh
things like quantum linking improved
interdiction service bacon improvements
so why don't we why don't we just go
from top to bottom here let's talk a
little bit about quantum linking what is
quantum linking in a
why should people I mean it's you and
your friends you're heading to a
destination and yeah first of all you
need to share the destination and also
everyone jumps at the same time so when
you're traveling there and someone gets
it's addictive you get pulled out all at
the same time so it's I mean I think for
multiplayer gameplay or playing with
your friends it's it's super important
so it's been on our horizon we've we've
discussed it we've implemented elements
of it but we haven't managed to finish
it off because there's always been some
big new massive shiny thing that we're
trying to do and so you know we've
actually one of the you know you'll see
on a couple of things here we said okay
look you know getting in with your
friends playing together doing stuff
together you know how do we make that
simpler easier because we have elements
little bits of it but they can't you
know like it's it's not nearly as you
know friendlier as polish as it can be
and it's all sort of like halfway
solutions that we've said well this is a
temporary thing when we have the new
shiny thing it'll be great so you know
now it's time now's the time to sort of
sort of say okay yeah let's not keep
deferring this right and this is
actually something that I've you know in
general sort of made a direction this
year which is like do not think like we
one of the problems we have in star
citizen is that we constantly are
thinking about when all this is done
like it's all like projecting into the
future well when we have all this it'll
be great right but you know we basically
are operating a live game as you said
right now people are playing I mean we
have people playing hundreds thousands
of hours evening some cases and you know
they've got a lot of patience I mean you
really do because there's a bunch of
issues and quality of life things and
shout out to our speakers and so yeah I
mean so it's like you know let's let's
let's let's recognize what we have which
is a live game make sure that the live
experience we make sure is as good as
possible and then you know we're adding
on all this extra you know functionality
and content as we go but don't forget
you know like as I think with 3-0
you know we rush to put so much stuff in
that I think we should did ourselves a
disservice and you know essentially
release something that was lacking
polish or had broken features and I
don't really want to be doing that going
forward and so you know so we one of the
things that we were looking at is okay
you know in terms of you know chatting
with your friends or getting together
with him and all joining together in the
same place and making that easy and
making that accessible or going to go to
places together like the quantum linking
there are all things that we should
spend some time to make sure it's it's
well and polished and a lot of times on
our features we put the base stuff in
and then that team schedule to do some
new feature but of course there's always
you know bug fixing and polish and then
maybe enhancements in the features or
you see people use it and go oh we can
make that better well that all takes
time and you have to do and you have to
so where's that time going to come from
for the teams and so that's kind of what
we're focusing on so quantum linking is
not just you and your buddies and other
ships you going together and if you get
it one of you gets interjected it pulls
all of you out so you're no longer
having to face these AI a pirate's by
themselves but it's also great for the
service beacon missions you know you'll
be able to pick a missions and now you
know if you're got to go out to some you
know or out-there area you don't it's
this one scroll over here so over here
it's no that's not the right one you
know now you can all link and you can
all go together yes yeah so a pretty
important feature and I do want to
mention because I'm looking at the chat
while we're talking the vote is not do
this or this these are all features that
are going to go into star citizen yeah
yeah yeah
so yeah it's be totally clear these
these are all things we are definitely
going to do what we're interested in
knowing is what's the most important
things be priorities that helps make us
priorities you know we're actually going
to try to do all this stuff and maybe
get it all done four three two but we
have to have a priority list because you
know we will have to at some point make
a call you know if there's something's
running behind something would have to
get pushed and so what we're really
interested in is what is the most
important things for you guys because
that really helps us in terms of
ordering
you know what our team's work on first
or you know if there's a conflict
between two things
who wins yeah even with 475 plus people
around the world and you're still only
so many things you can work on in any
given time there's always there's never
enough people everyone wants more people
I'm constantly amazed if you told me
that this company would be the size it
is and we're doing all this and it would
take this many people to to do this then
I would have told you you're absolutely
insane about four years ago three years
ago probably two as well but you know I
think it is part of the fact that the
game is so big and is built at such
fidelity but also at such scale and that
we're operating a live project and the
same time as doing development and also
building this incredibly ambitious
single player game squadron 42 it's just
a lot it seems like a good time to say
that I need like five more people all
right so moving on from quantum linking
which you know it seems like a pretty
valuable feature our next one in the
list was improved interdiction now
improved interdiction why don't you just
take them there what is improved in
addiction okay well of course well we're
trying to even in 3-1 we sort of have
done some interdiction improvements to
make sure that the spawning is like when
you get into dicted the AI of closed you
know so it's not like someone's ten or
eight kilometres away because in 3-0 it
was just a fixed number and the fixed
number was determined by the biggest
thing which was the scenario that I
think had some asteroids and so it had
to be a big distance so now the the
distances and the arrangement of the
ships is more dependent on the kind of
scenario you're getting pulled out into
and you know we even have we've put the
first I the basically we've always
planned to have sort of a quantum jammer
which was gonna you know be an item
which could either be on a ship or it
can be you know sort of mine or a way
that you could put out and so we
actually implemented that for AI so the
AI ships in 3-1 that interdict you will
one of the ships will have this item and
we're going to I think it's not in the
current
right now in the PTU but it will be by
the time hopefully we released next week
you should be able to be able to see
which one is actually jamming and you
have to disable it or destroy it and
then you'll be able to jump again
right or get far enough away from the
jamming signal to be able to do quantum
again so with the interdiction
improvements we won't need to finish off
the item functionality make it available
to players to equip the the component or
like deploy a launch a buoy so in 3 1 we
don't have the voice we would have the
boy in 3 2 we have a very simple version
of the component the item in 3 1 it
would be a much more sophisticated one
that pulls more power like obviously if
you got the power you can see maybe the
e/m signal the ship would be much
greater and you'll be able to go okay
that's the one that's that's jamming my
ability to use quantum and then we're
also going to enable it so players then
can deploy this and pull other players
or AI out and so that's going to be kind
of fun because you don't you so if I'm a
pirate you know I can deploy it and
maybe I don't catch players but I can
catch them AI generated cargo you know
haulers and you know attack them or get
you know go and take their cargo and
then we have another feature that would
tie into this which i think is the
service beacon thing is the world which
ties into another one talking about but
well we also want to make AI ships to be
able to also do our service beacon
responses so you could have a nice
feedback loop where a player puts the
quantum boy out captures a a AI cargo
hauler who then generates a service
beacon help request that brings in
another player or another AI so so so
and and that's a core gameplay loop I
mean like if you played freelancer you
play you know privateer you know the
whole point of you know there has to be
some risk or challenge to get to
locations and obviously in more
dangerous areas you get paid more for
your cargo or whatever with and there's
a higher chance of being interdicted or
attacked and so we need to make that
gameplay loop of you know going from
point A to point B challenging right but
not annoying
so in 3-0 definitely annoying three one
I think will be better and three two is
game focusing on that call because that
is the core gameplay loop in a lot of
sort of space system games and space
trading games so it's not just new tech
for the for the addiction it's actually
a increased variety in the type of
scenarios yeah I know definitely so so
again again where we'll be building more
fluid scenarios making them more sort of
emergent on and you know there's a
feedback loop between what AI and
players do and so I think it would make
the world just feel more alive and more
things going on and I for one I'm gonna
rush the opportunity to get revenge on
some of these AI players and interdict
them just over and I'm just gonna log in
for like eight hours straight and just
interdict AI over and over and over
again that's just for three-hour all
right so this leads into the service
beacon improvements so when we go ahead
and bring up the the she here service
speaking improvements the service beacon
will expand and evolve to include new
contract types additional filters and
more feedback precision AI characters
will be able to interface with the
system so that they too will be able to
request help and provide assistance to
others which will in turn increase both
how much this type of immediate content
we can offer at any given time as well
as the likelihood that someone whether
player or non-player character will be
drawn to respond to your calls for
support so what can we add to that
service beacon
well I mean so I mean we already have
service we can work on the 3-2 roadmap
so you know what we're talking about is
some of the stuff we did but also you
know like the a I mentioned AI is being
able to also generate service beacon
requests which sort of creates a really
nice feedback loop and you know general
you know I think we've decided that we
need to spend a little more time on the
usability and focus the first issue of
the you know the first use of service
beacon will be in 3-1 which was nice we
moved it up from 3 to into 3-1 so I know
everyone had a lot of teeth-gnashing
when bank killing went out of 3-1 yeah
but the service beacon stuff you know
came in which is I think it adds a
little bit of gameplay but it really is
going to sort of come alive more in 3 2
and will include things like the sort of
ability to be able to rate and
you know yes this person's a this one's
a reliable service beacon person or no
they're a bit sketchy
the service beacon system is new for 3/1
and I even though three ones only been
in PTU for a couple days
many backers won't have experienced it
as a system yet why and I think in some
of the past releases it wasn't
functional so I might have to check I
think in the PTU release that will be
happening today people should be able to
be using the service beacon but yet it's
a very very new thing yeah but it's kind
of cool because it's there basically
player generates it's the first stage of
player generated missions and the whole
service beacon system is actually how
players you know it's basically a player
contract manager it's like hey I need
you to do this job whether it's helping
me I'm under attack or it's take me from
point A to point B or escort me from
point A to point B or you know
eventually you know take out this person
or whatever it would be the this is this
is how players will enter into contracts
with other players put jobs and missions
out also probably how they'll be able to
sort of you know like you can hire
some people to help you do this big run
which you'll make a bunch of money on
and then you distribute some of the
products some of your costs go to the
people you add to hire to help you to do
the run and so the service beginning is
the infrastructure that allows that and
we're building on top of it and it's
very critical I think for the player
interaction or we're talking about you
with your friends or interacting with
other players achieving stuff either
together in cooperation or in some cases
you could be in opposition but I think
very much a good focus of star citizen
is the idea of like you and your friends
going and doing stuff together whether
it's you know against you know AI or
it's against players you know it's kind
of up to you but I think you know our
big focus is yes this is an online game
how can me and my friends go and have
fun together a pretty big feature yep
and and and I'm thinking I'm just
imagining that somebody is going to end
up creating a star citizen Yelp to start
reviewing people and servers well that's
actually the idea so the service beacon
is going to have a terrace so it's going
to have like
of the Yelp ratings or the uber ratings
where you can both rate the person
that's responding taking the contract
and the person that's giving the
contract so it'll help to have that sort
of you'll you know if someone's
basically you know they they do a
honeypot
deal like you know you give them a 0
star 1 star rating and you see this
person who's offering a contract and
they've got you know their ratings one
versus two an African contractor whose
ratings 5 you're gonna take the person
as a 5 rating my condolences to tyler
witkin ahead of time all right moving on
from service bacon improvements one of
the more intriguing options that are
that are on the survey at least for me
speaking only for myself first tier of
guilds and associations now that this
kind of came up in our in our vault in
our ages vulcan promotion with the
Wayfarers club and i've seen a lot of
people talking who might have thought
that this was just you know sales copy
this was just something for the lower
but but this is actually the way prayers
club is actually a guild our association
that's going into the game it'll be a
functional organization in the game yes
yes so we we've always had a plan you
know and this was true in privateer or
things like velocity you have you know
non player organizations or guild you
know where the classic ones of the
merchant gamer scenario guild and so we
have those and we we also want to have a
level of associations to like you know
the Wayfarers clubs almost like triple-a
in space and you know like you have it
here in america and triple-a you know
they have services or come out and
they'll tell you or whatever and also if
you you know go to certain places i'll
give you discounts because they
pre-negotiated discount and so we
actually want to start to put the
infrastructure in for the various you
know guilds and associations you'll do
so in three two it would be the very
beginning of that but as we go through
would build much more of it up and and
so what you would do is you would
essentially you know earn some money or
you know pay with you you see to be a
member of this guild that you know you
would
- but you get benefits for it like for
instance you know jobs or missions that
maybe you couldn't get somewhere else or
you could get help in a way that you
wouldn't normally get it or you get
discounts in discount gas prices yeah
exactly that's sort of what we were
talking about for the white Wayfarer cop
so so it's the beginning of that and
that will definitely have quite a lot of
these that would be sort of focused on
the different you know like the I'm sure
there'll be a salvagers organization and
you know various different those in the
world that you can you know you know as
an ex-military one you could join or
whatever it would be and so we want to
start to put that in to kind of lay that
infrastructure because it's quite
important for I think the long-term
gameplay very cool so yeah that stuff we
were talking about in the ages volcán
promotion wasn't just a flavor copy
should check that out if you haven't
already waivers know things just
flavored coffee if you read it in the
fiction stuff we're usually thinking of
at some point that would actually exist
in the world that's the whole point so
if you read you know like the writers do
really nice fiction stuff but a lot of
that fiction stuff is specifically
seeding what we want to do long term so
so don't just view it as fiction it is
it is it is highlighting where the game
will go hi it's the next step on the
list the party system this is a party
system reads these improvements these
improvements will improve these
improvements Mike these improvements
will improve the players ability to
create groups allowing you to team up
with your friends or to join the same
game instance and cooperate on jobs and
missions that's a big one yeah well I
mean I think this is a massive
communauté
complaint of feedback for a long time
and we've always been so yeah yeah when
we get the full spectrum integration
then there will get it over and
basically what we've we've said was look
we just got a focus some time on this
now
so because yeah I mean I'm saying this
you want a game with your friends and
you want to get me your AAG made so
or you know however you want to do it
you need to have an easy way to do it
and right now it's not so easy at all so
we want to spend some actual time on our
back-end and on a front-end side to make
that process earlier and sort of be the
beginnings of what it is yeah let's you
know make it easy I to many people tell
me like how will be really easy I would
like it much you know I could only get
in with my friends reliably counterpoint
though I told my dad I wouldn't play
with them until this was in so if we put
it off yeah you know so you don't have
to vote for it
I think of disco right now partying says
no it's a big one of the folks that
folks have been talking and asking for
that for a while
complementary to that team chat the
improvements to the team chat system
that will polish communication between
players and make the experience more
robust and intuitive work on this system
will also begin to factor in the
incorporation of spectrum into the game
yeah well you know we've talked a long
time one of the reasons why we did the
whole spectrum set up on the platform is
the idea is we're going to unify you
know the friends lists and all the rest
of stuff that you'll do on make on the
platform side and it can also be
replicated down on the game side so you
don't have to maintain parallel lists
but you know basically the chat feature
in the game right now is the chat that
was in from the very beginning we spent
no time other than just fixing it if it
breaks in the game and you know like
yeah how does that work with your list
of friends or you know groups and so
again it's along with you know getting
together with your friends getting into
the game having an ability to sort of
chat with them and that in your various
sort of like setups or groups it's super
important and it's also a precursor to
the type stuff that's going to come in
with 3 3 so we want to get it in there
and make it easy because you know right
now yeah just there once in a general
chat which is cool but it would and even
that still you know again like I said
the implementation of chat that we had
before we even did you know the the PU
yeah it's best I don't say anything all
right so next up on the list we've got
economy shopping UI experience now this
feature includes the implementation of
shopping kiosks in the stores and
increased variation of available
products including ship items and
weapons not physically available to
display so like mail-order catalog yeah
we search so one of the big things is
that you know they obviously we want to
be selling everything in game ships ship
weapons ship components all the rest of
at the moment in the game because we've
got a limited amount of real estate and
we don't have the big landing zones in
we don't have the big planets in yet we
don't have places to sell ship weapons
or ships or any of that stuff because
they're just we don't have stores set
for them and we don't have the room for
it now that will we will you know have
sort of physical you know big stores and
displays as the landing zones come in
and all the rest of stuff but we haven't
done the sort of shopping kiosk
functionality which will allow you to
have a kiosk in a shop and you know you
could go through a bunch of ship weapons
or you know even the buggy or something
and you can see it there and say okay
I'll buy that and then it can be
delivered to you but it doesn't need to
be displayed in the store so it give us
the ability to allow you to buy a wider
variety of items like basically we want
to get rid of the Virgin Voyager direct
store online on the platform that the
goal is that's going away and you all
those items you buy in the in the game
but we can't do that until we can have
like a location to sell you in and you
know up until now that's sort of waiting
for the landing locations but really if
we can get some of the key our stuff in
we can sort of make that move studio and
I think it would be good because one of
the things we want to do is you know the
ability to sort of upgrade or very old
coming one of the later features we have
here you know we want to make the
components of your ship much more
meaningful this whole item 2.0 that
we've talked about there's a whole
infrastructure for it but we've got to
finish it off properly for you to really
realize and understand and see the
benefits of it and
one of the components of that has been
able to sort of buy bigger and better
stuff and so the shopping kiosk will
allow that to happen sooner rather than
later because you know otherwise we're
kind of bound by real estate and then
we're bound by when we roll in the
planets and the other locations which
you know they're kind of dependent on
the object container streaming and
extend yourself so it we think that's a
good way to get some of this possibility
of game play in the game sooner rather
than later
awesome so you know seems like shopping
you know you I but obviously it's a
gateway to a lot of core game that's
very important which leads us into the
item 2.0 ship systems and weapons so
this is another option there's another
feature that you'll be able to vote for
it and again remember we are doing all
of these that's this is just about
prioritizing so item 2.0 ship systems
weapons says feature work would include
finalizing item 2.0 functionality that
allows them to overheat misfire and
suffer critical failures based on
factors such as increased wear and or
damage it would also introduce deeper
functionality to upgradable items so
that new power plants shields coolers
stealth coms radar all make the marked
difference to a shift performance based
on how they are configured so yeah that
this this is this is the big thing from
you know this is my Hornet and you have
your horn my horn it won't I would say I
would say this is probably the biggest
missing element of the kind of like core
sort of gameplay mechanic of venturing
around in space is that we haven't
finished so we have an infrastructure
for item 2.0 and a lot of the bits are
there but not enough of the stuffs in
there that the the the user can realize
it so where we so we already had wear
and tear in the 3-2 roadmap so wear and
tear is definitely part of this but
really where it comes in is you know the
effect of say for instance I'm running
my engines my thrusters hot right I'm
over I'm overpowering I'm putting more
power to him so I can boost him so I can
turn a bit yeah I can for that time I'm
turning him but they're running hot so
as a running heart they're becoming
overheated as they're becoming
overheated there's a chance that they
may misfire or they could even have a
critical failure
more their overheating the faster the
wear increases wear also affects your
chance of misfire and overheating so
because you need to have you need to
have downsides to doing things right so
everything is the trade-off right so
what we don't really have that's that
effective in the game right now is you
running your ship should have to be
making conscious choices am I putting my
power to the shields because I'm going
to come over then I'm not being able to
put as much power to my guns so I can't
recharge them as quickly or I can't put
as much power to my thrusters to a you
know to super heat the plasma to check
the you know the the gases to thrust me
around and so what we want to do is is
is is give you know focus much more
making all that whole sort of holistic
aspect work that also has the issues to
downside the wear that then means that
the item as it gets older or gets
worried you're not fixing that like if
you've got a damaged item you're not
repairing it the chance that it can
misfire or just have a critical failure
as much higher right so what we want you
to do is you've got your ship you've
been out there you've been a fat you've
got to take back you're gonna have to
repair it make sure the equipment's in
good taste it's like if you don't you
know do a overhaul of your change and
every so many hours of operation you
know you could quite likely fall out of
the sky in the real world well we want
you to have those same sort of calls and
that you know and if you overuse it like
you just you know you just trash your
your your you know in the real world you
thrash your car all the time you on your
breaks all the time well you know at
some point your breaks are gonna fail if
you don't replace them right so we need
to make sure that all that whole loop is
in there and it has effects and players
can feel it and so there isn't any case
where one player can just say oh yeah
well doesn't matter I've got so much
power everything's powered and tiller
there and everything works perfectly we
want sort of trade off in the ships even
you know big expensive ships that you
have to make decisions on your resources
am I doing this right doing that there's
always a there's a pro and a con for
both of them and then also having this
the item 2.0 finished I properly means
that the multi crew behavior that you
can do is much more like so one of if
they
and say a constellation versus in horner
is the crew could run around and like be
fixing up components as a sort of
failing that would enable you to last
longer or in a fight or out in space so
you know if you're getting hits on your
shield and you you're your power plant
it's putting our energy to try and keep
the shields up right as that strain on
your power plant the power plant would
have a you know at some point misfire
opportunity if it misfires one of them
fuel rods in the power plant goes power
plant now has say four fuel rods so now
it goes to 75% power instead of a
hundred percent power as a player you
could go and change the sub component
the fuel rod our knee and then get it
back to 100% right
and you know the more so and the same
for other items could have fuses and
stuff and so we have these sub
components we've got they are even for
them but having that whole loop October
you can go and do stuff and you know I
mentioned Co thieves at the top of it
and it has some kind of like much
smaller stuff but you know you're in a
fighh and your cannon ball comes into
your ship and there's a hole in your
ship and if you don't put a plank on it
and you don't bail out the water I mean
that's cool right there's someone's
there
you know driving the ship someone's down
trying to bail out the water or
someone's firing the cannons and you
know you know it's that's what we've had
is our design from day one you know back
in 2012 and 13 and I sort of feel like
we need to finish it off properly
instead of talk about it and and and get
it done so that was a that's a big sort
of drive for me too you know so I think
it's I think it will provide a vast
amount of fun and gameplay and
challenges and trade-offs and discussion
for the for everyone out there when you
talk about having to maintain your
components or they miss fire all I kept
thinking was Han Solo in the Falcon in
Star Wars versus Han Solo in the Falcon
and Empire Strikes Back you know one
that's maintained when it's not any cos
you can see the difference there also
land out in the Falcon in the news so
excited all right and then the final of
the feature improvements that backers
will be able to to vote on fps AI combat
the first stage of getting combat AI
into the persistent universe now this
would expand mission types by
introducing the risk that an AI could be
waiting to ambush you on a
moon or in a Hulk drifting in space now
you say FPS come we're talking like like
not in ships obviously we have comm yeah
we have we have ship come I know it's
basically you know we have all these
great space wrecks but there's not a lot
of unless there's some other player
there waiting to ambush you there's not
a lot of a challenge in it so you know
the the goal of the idea has always been
that like you know some of these wrecks
could have some outlaws of pirates
waiting to ambush you and you know
prevent yeah creates a known risk
challenge and also just kind of fun for
us to use another part of our you know
like we've got a very you know you know
full-featured FPS game inside of a
full-featured flying around in space
game and you don't really have an
opportunity to use it that much outside
of playing other players and you know
ultimately you know the goal in the star
citizen universe is to sort of be 90
percent kind of AI environment 10
percent players and you know there's a
you know the problem with player versus
player stuff is that there's always a
loser in that case that's a player right
so there's someone that's pissed off but
AI don't get pissed off when they get
shot in the face they don't get pissed
off when they get blown up in space and
so I think it's very important to have a
lot of AI or environment encounters
whether it's in space are down on the
ground so as a player even they're like
great I compute you know like yeah I
took I took that pirate out oh yeah I'm
badass right and you know I may not be
nearly as good of a pilot as as you know
the guy that's obsessively or the girl
that's obsessively playing 30 hours a
week and can snipe me a kilometer or
whatever but you know it's it allows
people to sort of have fun because you
know combat to a certain extent is one
of the core mechanics and so I think
when we'd be missing we're missing in
the PU this sort of ground combat aspect
or you know like shipboard combat aspect
and so this is the the first aspect of
it and obviously definitely always on
our plans but we kind of want to try to
make a bit of a push for it just to yeah
have some challenge of variety when
you're down on
you know these moons these you know
large amounts of area that we've created
for you to explore like let's have some
challenges let's have some risks down
there rather than just looking at the
sunset or the sunrise and I can already
see the reddit thread Chris hates PvP
being creepy he doesn't wear time of
adding to it we've got PvP now yeah I
don't hate PvP I'm adding to it I just
think I think what you want to do is you
want to have a game that allows for both
and allows people to allows people to
choose kind of what they're more
interested in I mean that's the service
beacon stuff and all the rest of stuff
and so I'm hoping that we put a
structure together and the way that
we're doing it it will allow for both
types of play and you know people I kind
of view what's gonna happen with PvP is
going to be more all player organization
driven and they'll be fighting over
resources on you know there's a vast
amount of land that we're now creating
with this sort of very detailed
procedural system so I sort of whew
you've got you're gonna have individual
players that are playing sort of lone
wolf style small groups of friends doing
stuff together cooperatively you know I
would I could kind of see there then be
more kind of PvE focus like let's go and
adventure and do stuff and we have fun
and get attacked by AI pirates or
whatever it would be and then the bigger
orgs on a player basis are fighting over
resources and you know various aspects
that you know a sort of player PvP and
that's but it allows people to sort of
choose what they they want and a group
of you know a smaller group could join
that larger player group and be part of
this bigger battle or you know all
versus all that's right so I think we
can have all those in the game and I'd
like to do it in a sort of organic
holistic way so I don't want people to
sort of only be in a PvP server or only
be in a you know a PvE server I want it
to be this is the world and it's sort of
up to you to sort of play and choose
your challenges alright so but that
that's that's the Alpha three point two
feature survey that will go live later
today look for that in shortly after the
conclusion of this show we got about 10
minutes left yeah you want to do some
backer questions for sure
do it right off the bat this question
came up a bunch of times we talked a
little bit about it but how far are we
in the development of mining gameplay
it's kinda it's an equation but it came
up so many times I feel like I have so
we're pretty deep into it we generate we
have a resource map for the various
planets which determines what kind of
resources can be mined which also
determines what kind of rocks are
generated we already have the gameplay
for controlling your mining laser and
breaking apart rocks so you know the
goal is that you should be able to once
you learn how to do it you could mine
just based sort of the visual and aural
feedbacks but you also will have sort of
UI that will sort of be telling you like
how much energy you're putting in and
how close to in the optimal zone the the
rock is or it's gonna go critical and
blow up but yeah we're pretty far along
I mean I've been reviewing the sprint
reviews of it and it's looking it's
looking good so four by three - I'm
pretty confident that it'll be pretty
full feature them and polished okay this
question also came up quite a bit one of
the ships coming online with three point
one is the the misc razor we've had the
dragonfly with with 3.0 the Knox queue
is coming with 3.1 which was also a
racing variant we haven't had any
additions to racing in play for a firsta
first yeah yeah so we've actually I mean
we don't have it on the list here we've
talked about trying to get some racing
stuff in four three two if we can make
it definitely in four three three the
other thing which is sort of going to
the playing of now in the game is that
we we've decided that we need to make
sure that we give love to arena
commander we give love to star marie and
we give love to Marie Cup racing and so
we're in the process of looking to build
dedicated teams to focus on that because
the problem right now is that you know
we did the arena commander because that
was okay let's get the dogfighting
working and then we did star marine
because us I get the FPS working and
there
all sort of feeding into the PU so all
the people that were supporting and
doing that do PU stuff now so you know
essentially we just sort of fix up stuff
in arena commander of stammering but
we're not really adding new content
polishing and keeping up there and we
sort of feel like we need to have some
dedicated scrum teams that that you know
you're the arena commander team you're
the star Marine team and we're adding
you know new levels new challenge
because for me the like long-term vision
for what we're doing here in star
citizen is yes you got the PU the array
venturing in but you know arena
commander is where you go to practice so
you don't have to risk your stuff it's
also where you can go and you can easily
sort of just you know you're on you're
on a certain level playing fields you
can say objectively who's the best dog
fighter in a way that would be maybe
hard in the PU and the same four-star
marine and the same for the marika
racing now we're going to have racing
that will be embedded in in the PU that
you can do which will be really kind of
cool but the idea is yet we I want to
make arena commander and star marine
viable ongoing game modes that have
updates that have new content and allow
people because I think sometimes you may
just say you know what I don't have the
time to get into the PU and do a big
mission with all my friends but maybe I
just want to get in and you know have a
you know see how I do on the
leaderboards and have a quick dogfight
or you know get into a quick stammering
match so I feel like we've done a
disservice by like getting these game
modes up and running to get a to get a
mechanic working and then once once we
have we just like okay so the PU now we
don't worry about it so so we are
definitely going to do that so do look
for stuff that will add for racing that
is on our agenda only downside is you
know unfortunately good resources don't
grow on trees
so hiring the people and getting them up
takes a bit of time but it is a it is a
goal for us to have dedicated
stakeholders so that's all they're doing
they're not getting distracted to fix
something else on the PU so look look
for that to be happening towards the
later part of this year all right well
we do it that's it that's it yeah yeah
yeah everybody always dreads coming on
the show with me and I'm like
bypassed don't worry about it all right
so remember the Alpha 3.2 feature survey
will go live very shortly later today
look for that that it's open to all
backers it's not a concierge exclusive
or subscribers loose exclusive if you
supported the project you'll be able to
cast your vote and that'll go for
roughly about a week I think we're still
kind of flexible with the end time but
it'll be it'll be at least a week yeah
we probably want it done
I would think before we start on three
two stuffs exactly we need we need the
feedback so that we can make our
decisions four three two so we are
aiming to go live for three one the end
the next week no so yeah so look for
that later today Chris thank you so much
for be on the show
you're welcome Jared and thank you
everyone out there tuning in and
listening and everyone that's back to us
thank you very much and you know I think
hopefully you guys are going to like
three one and you know this year I'm
pretty excited I think we've got a good
cadence going so it's gonna be good okay
we'll see in a few minutes everybody

equipment slots players building their
own space stations and more so don't
forget you there's also one week left to
pick up an Aegis Vulcan refueling
repairing and rearming ship if you
haven't already and there's also the
paint and decal library to pack that's
good even if you're waiting to earn the
ship in the game so for reverse the
