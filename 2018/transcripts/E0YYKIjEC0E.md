[Music]
Hi everybody. Welcome to a special
edition of Reverse the Verse Live here
in uh the Tagert Conference Room. The
beautiful, stylish uh Keith is shaking
his head over there. Tagert conference
room in in Wimslow, United Kingdom. Uh
I'm your host, content manager for
Global Video Production, Jared Huckabe.
And today we are joined by an esteemed
panel of engineers and QA and
programmers here to discuss a topic very
close to my heart. Uh I was going to say
something funny like basket weaving but
no it's object container streaming. Uh
now object container streaming is
something we've been talking about for a
long time. uh we we it's we when we
started the conversation about uh
serialized variables once upon a time
for buying calling object container
streaming network performance
improvements you know all these all
these different topics that all kind of
roll into an overall performance uh uh
improvement for Star Citizen. Uh we
wanted as we approach 33 and the uh the
inclusion of Hursten and and object
container streaming, we wanted to take
one of these last opportunities to
really dive into what this system is and
explore the work that's being done and
uh maybe dispel a couple myths about it
because we see a lot of misinformation
on on the forums and stuff like that. Uh
people thinking it's a silver bullet
that's going to solve every problem in
the world and stuff like that. So, I
really want to take some time to talk
through exactly what object container
streaming is uh and what it means for
Star Citizen. Before we do that, we do
the same thing every week. We assume
that nobody has seen any other episode
of Reverse the Verse before. So, let's
take a few moments and introduce
ourselves. And we'll start over here
with you, Gordon. Who are you and what
do you do for Star Citizen?
I am Gordon Mlan. I'm a senior gameplay
programmer um on the FPS team here in
Wimsilo. So, um my main rema is the
actor. So I own the actual player and
any sort of human type person running
around.
Gotcha.
Yeah. So I've been here for like three
and a half years now.
Say you've been here just about as long
as I am.
Yeah, I've been here for quite a bit
now. So yeah.
And uh you said uh most of your focus is
on FPS stuff, but how how what what have
you been doing with regards to object
container streaming?
Yeah. So I was sort of drafted in as
support gameplay engineering support for
object container streaming. Um so it's a
lot of sort of um
mostly bug fixing and sort of fixing
peripheral issues around OCS. Um sort of
probably the main biggest one was the
likes of the mission markers for
instance. So making them work with OCS
tracking tracking a mission when you're
out of range of such like um yeah and
then general performance stuff as well.
Tracking all the stuff that he brings
up.
Yeah, pretty much.
So Chris, who are you and what do you do
for Star Citizen? Uh I'm Chris
Eckersley. I'm lead technical QA in the
UK.
And what do you do for start? So what
what does that do?
Um so we're part of the main QA
department, but uh we tend to handle
more of the tools and techy side of
things. Uh so we tend to be a bit more
hands-on with the servers than the rest
of the department, which is why uh OCS
and Bulling stuff tends to fall our way.
Gotcha. So less of the less of the
gameplay stuff. A big misconception
about QA is that it's all just playing
the game all day. Uh you're you're
you're you're sitting there beating on
the tools and the servers and the back
end and stuff like that.
That's right. Yeah.
Gotcha. And last but certainly not
least, Clive. Who are you and what do
you do for Star Citizen?
I'm Clive Johnson. I'm the lead network
programmer. Um what do I do? Uh
yeah,
you're Mr. Happy Funtime.
Yeah, program a little bit of
networking. Uh try and avoid going into
meetings. Um, so yeah, my my main focus
is the the client server network rather
than the back end side. Uh, so it's it's
getting the game plan to talk to the
server and get the information back uh
as efficiently and um with as little
bandwidth as possible.
Gotcha. Now we've featured Clive on
other shows about networking and about
buying calling and stuff like that. Um,
we as always with Reverse the Verse, we
are going to be taking questions live
from the Twitch chat where you can
submit your questions with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets. You can also do so in
Spectrum, our live uh communication
platform on robertspace industries.com.
Uh, the question period is going to come
a little bit later because I I want to I
want to I want to start with a with an
oral journey, if you would. I want to
shake things up a little bit a little
different. I don't I only get one week a
year in these other studios. Uh, so now
I've got you here all in a room. You
can't fake, oh, the Skype call went down
or whatever because I'm here. Um, let's
just talk about OCS in general. Uh,
let's start at the beginning. What were
we trying to achieve with OCS? It's it's
a what what what was you know we we
started working on OCS I think when I
was talking to Luke Hail who's a a the
associate producer that that handles a
lot of your work he said the the
earliest works on this you started about
three years ago uh when we started work
on OCS 3 years ago what were we trying
to achieve
the the main concerns always been trying
to fit Star Citizen onto um a a player's
computer Um obviously we servers tend to
be a lot more powerful than the domestic
users computer. So having all this
expansive solar system uh all the
planets all the locations
uh all the ships loaded in all the time
is just not possible without masses and
masses of memory which is much more than
your typical user is going to have. Um,
so the primary concern is just making
the game fit, breaking it up into
smaller chunks that can fit on each
player's PC.
Gotcha. when we when we started moving
towards 360°ree
fully realized moons and planets and
wanting to do that without loading
screens, you know, you leave up from one
and you don't want to like you set
course for from Hurst into microte and
you don't want to go, you know, quantum
jump and then it goes, you know, loading
screen, you know, and then and change
that. Um, object container streaming was
was the tech that we wanted to be able
to seamlessly move like when you turn
away from Hurston, you move away from
Hurston to pull Hursten out of out of
out of a out of a client's memory and
then feed in microte that and then vice
versa. And this and it's not just the
juggling of the client side, it's also
of the server side. I understand it's
doing the same thing with the server
because even once we start putting in
all these space stations and and uh uh
planets and moons and everything uh
servers still have a finite amount of
memory finite amount of processing
power. So there's there's client side
OCS and then there's still a serverside
component. Am I right with that?
That's that's right. That's not
something we're working on for 3 further
down the line. Um but yeah, because the
solar system is going to get even more
densely populated and more planets and
so on, uh even the servers with a
massive amount of memory that they have
won't be able to keep everything in
place at the same time. So they'll need
to stream in and out locations based on
demand. So when a player goes to a
location or as he's heading towards a
location rather, the server will detect
that go okay, I need to stream in the
the entities that are there that the all
the planet and directs and whatever
around. Um, so by the time the player
reaches that location, it's all in
memory on the server, it'll the server
has to coordinate that with the client
itself and tell the client what it needs
to stream in. So the entities are
present on the client as well. Uh, and
then when the player leaves that
location, the server's free to unload
that information, free the memory for
anything else. We were talking just a
few minutes before we went live and uh
this isn't a technology that we're
inventing for Star Citizen that this
this this this juggling act of moving
things in and out of of of memory in
video games. This exists for many years.
Yes. Yeah.
What's the difference with Star Citizen?
Why why why is this such a big thing for
Star Citizen then?
Um well, map streaming is generally more
common in single player games. Um, a
lot, not all, but a lot of, um,
multiplayer games will confine the maps
to smaller sizes so that it can all fit
in memory all at once. Uh, so once
you've loaded in,
all the memory is resident on your
client. Sorry, all the data is resident
on your client. No streamings required
and that cuts down uh, the chance of any
stalls
uh, or any frame rate hits uh, and makes
for a smoother online experience. said
that the challenge is to do streaming
during a multiplayer game.
Mhm.
Not have any stalls or um performance
hits. And it's also, as I say, it's
about the scale that we're doing this
on. Um obviously our our maps are
millions of times bigger than than most
maps of of virtually any other game. So
yeah, it's it's a question of scale and
trying to do it while you're online as
well.
Gotcha. So, it's it's not that we're
necessarily reinventing the wheel here.
It's that we're adapting the wheel to a
scale that's previously unheard of.
Yeah, it Yeah, we are we're probably one
of the bigger games ever envisioned at
this point. Um, and we've kind of we've
we've done quite a lot of stuff over the
last couple years where we've had like
snippets of game like Star Commander
where it's been like a small contained
bubble of the game and we're now going
right, it's now that, but it's in this
big massive universe. It's making
everything bigger and by going well if
we only need to stream in this one bit
where the FPS is happening the
performance should be the same as star
reading probably on the client. So
um now
so that's why we want to do it what's
this look like when when when we get
there now now obviously 33 and you you
mentioned it earlier and I'm glad you
brought up the the server side object
container streaming is not a is not a
part of the work that we're doing right
now. Uh we're doing we're working on the
client side uh object container
streaming. Uh but once this is all done,
let let's let's jump ahead. You know how
much I love jumping ahead to the far
future, but I'm going to do it this
time. Once we jump ahead, once once
we've got binding and once we've got uh
server side uh object container
streaming and then in the future once we
have server side, what did I say that
right? Client once we have client side
object data streaming and then later on
down the road once we have server side
object container streaming. What's
what's that going to look like as as far
as performance? Do does everybody
suddenly just get 90 frames a second on
everything? It it's it's what what
what's this picture look like?
Um,
okay. It it's not it's not a silver
bullet as you kind of mentioned before.
So, we can't make any guarantees on how
performance is going to improve. Um,
partly because there's so many
variations of CPUs and motherboards and
RAM and everything else and GPUs that
you can't predict how it's going to
affect all the different combinations.
So, it's a best guess uh what we think
is actually going to help um what it's
going to look like. So effectively the
the difference to what you have now is
you start off in your bed at port also
um and
yellow is loaded on your clients um and
there are entities on your client in
memory hopefully idle and not doing
anything if the um the in range um
update calling is is working correctly.
Uh the difference will be with OCS
you'll load into Port Alisar and
basically Port Alisar
and a few entities for the the uh the
what's it called the uh the star map
will be loaded and that's it. Uh any
players and ships that are around your
immediate vicinity will be loaded in. Um
anyone who quantum travels to your
current location will dynamically be
loaded in.
Mhm. um anyone who comes and travels
away will be loaded out and your client
won't have any awareness of them
anymore. Um so it cuts down the amount
of memory that your client needs. Uh it
should cut down some of the performance
overhead uh for maintaining all these um
entities of memory as well. Um
I suppose as you move around the solar
system, yeah, it will unload areas that
are uh it that it doesn't need anymore
unloading the new ones. So you head off
to to Lefki, it will stream Leking for
the first time and that's the first time
your your client is aware of those
entities in that location.
Okay. Uh what criteria do we use for
that? Is is it just proximity? Is that
the only criteria? It's we we we we set
a we set a bubble or or a streaming
window around you and anything within
this area is visible to you and anything
that's outside is is not loaded into
memory pretty much. Yeah, it's it's not
exactly a hard bubble. Uh it's not a a
defining distance. It's actually the um
kind of the the size the object will
appear to you if you were to look at it.
So an object that's twice as big, you
will see it the same size as an object
that's
half as big, twice as far away. See what
I mean?
Okay.
So a a planet will stream out Well, no,
that's a bad example. Yeah. Leki will
stream out very far away, but a small
spaceship like um and a Gladius will
stream out much closer.
Gotcha. So there's there's there's a
there's a like a tagging system involved
in like it it's that the system's going
to know that if if you're approaching
Levky to bring Levky in at this far
away.
Yeah.
But if it if it's a Starfare to bring
the Starfare in at this far away and if
it's a Hornet to bring the Hornet in at
this far away like that. So So it's so
it's an intelligent kind of switching.
Yes.
Between So like that. And and is that is
that
um and that's something ult at the end
at the when all is said and done. Is
that is that something handled by the
servers or by the clients or
that's handled entirely by the servers?
Okay. Yeah. Interesting. All right. So,
uh the work on when we we're doing we
we've got notes because this is a pretty
dense topic here. Um
when when the work started on this uh it
was originally envisioned is kind of
three steps. Uh bind calling which we've
talked about quite a bit. Uh then client
side uh OCS which is what we're working
on right now. Uh and then uh later down
the road server side OCS. Yeah. Um let's
talk real quick about bindulling and
what it is and what its role here is. If
you can just who wants to give me just a
nickel version. What is bindulling?
Anybody? One, two, three.
Don't want to jump in when there's a
problem.
Go for it. Yeah. So um
this is a test score.
This this a I should have revised
further. This is Yeah. Um yeah. So it's
this is the act of unbinding the
entities on the client when they go out
of range. Um so if you're too far away
from stuff, it basically streams it out
is the idea. Um
there's quite a lot of implications for
that for gameplay code. Um which I'm
obviously slightly concerned with being
a gameplay programmer. Um, so it's a
type of thing of if I'm on one side of
the universe and I've got to go and kill
someone on the other side of the
universe, I would normally in the game
just now you see a little objective
marker, but
that's not there because he doesn't
exist on my client because he has been
unbound.
Um, or similarly if you've got have a
comm's call with someone who's too far
away, he'll be unbound. Um, or sort of
similar things. Um, and there's from a
more technical standpoint, we have um
the likes of all our entity pointers
themselves will as soon as something
goes out range, they'll all become
invalid. You can't talk to the entity
anymore because he doesn't exist for
you. You can't um like you can't get his
status. You can't get the amount of
health he's got because it doesn't it no
longer exists on your client. Um, and
you've got to be able to handle um him
obviously leaving and then him coming
back again later on. So if you've got to
fix stuff up and if you've then got to
um reworked your gameplay system to make
it work with someone that's just came
back. Um
so what are the answers to those things?
Um so for the likes of the the markers
uh they were solved by having an
independently streamable object. So
that's basically saying we've got this
little marker which a really small
lightweight thing. Um it's really far
away from you but the server is going to
tell you that it has to exist in the
client because you need to know some
stuff about it. um it's removed from the
normal hierarchy. So it's not um if
you've got a marker, for instance, on a
person that's inside a ship that's
inside another ship, normally you would
need to have all these zones all the way
down to get him.
Um in this case, it's just that marker
and it just gives you the zone position
of the biggest zone that's still
streamed in. So the planet or the root
zone if he's just out in the space
somewhere.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong on this.
I'm picturing like when you're playing
golf and you you you you pick up your
ball and you put a quarter down in its
place.
It's like so so that you know where that
thing's supposed to be. The ball isn't
actually there anymore, but but you know
where it's going to be and when it comes
time for you to actually need to
interact with it, it's going to know
where
kind of um and it's also got the
advantage of we can do things like the
because it's so far away, the position
doesn't need to update constantly
because it's so far away, you can't tell
if it's 10 cm out. So it can update
every 30 frames or every 60 frames or
whatever, which also obviously increases
performance ever so slightly.
That's going to be a big one for server
FPS.
Yeah. Um and it's more um we don't need
to get the messages from the client from
the server as often. So it's not it's
not affected. And then once you get in
range, once it gets fully bound,
everything else has been unbound. So the
network performance is then the
stuff. Um
yeah, and then obviously there's stuff
I'm not as involved in. the legs of the
radar scanning stuff has got to be able
to work when the stuff it's scanning
doesn't exist on your client. And so a
lot a lot of the game code was changed
from everything happens on the client to
the client has to ask the server for
some results or it has to push requests
to the server for things to happen.
We've seen that. It's a big uh it's a
big uh concern of the community is is uh
we're seeing it coming in the questions
right now about how scan how long range
scanning is supposed to work. If this
thing isn't loaded in for if in your
client universe it doesn't exist, how
are you supposed to scan for it and
discover it?
Well, I mean even the likes of when
Clive was mentioning what how we decide
if something streams out is based on how
big it is on your screen. So if there's
a Gladius that's 20 km away, they're
going it's going to be one pixel on your
screen. it can probably stream out or
it's going to be less than a pixel it
can stream out. Um there's some
adjustments made to that for the likes
of the radar. So the Gladius will be
made to think it's bigger because it
needs to stay around because although
you can't see it, your radar can see it.
So there needs to be some kind of um
adjustment there. So you're still able
to still able to get the up to date and
the high end the high um
frequency updates to see where it is.
And and how does how does serialized
variables play into buying calling? It's
a serialized variables that that in my
terrible analogy and forgive me if I
keep using it, but the quarter that you
put down is is is is that what a
serializ I think one of the complexities
of OCS is there's a whole interconnected
bunch of technologies that will need to
work. So there's serialized variables
need to be there. There's actual bindcom
itself. There's the likes of the um the
um I've lost my train of thought now
where I was going with this. other
technologies as well that only need to
exist for it to work. Um the serialized
variables are kind of like the thing
that sort of almost I don't want to say
glues it all together because that's a
bit of a cliche phrase but um uh for the
likes of the marker you'll have
serialized variables that have all the
data you need in it. Um the server will
be able to tell you the data you the
data you need to have in those variables
how often you need to get it. Um and it
will kind of do it seamless almost
seamlessly from a game gameplay point of
view. So we've just got the data we need
to use. And and uh for again just
assuming that this is somebody's first
show uh what is serialized what are
serialized variables?
So serialized variables are the um the
mechanism that we expose to the gameplay
programmers to allow them to communicate
over the network. So um the game's built
out of entities. Entities are built out
of components. components have these
serialized variables which are values
that can change over time as the
gameplay programs assign new values to
it. Those change values will get
replicated over the network to the
equivalent entity on your clients. It
will uh change the value of the
serialized variable there as though it's
being changed exactly by the server. So
it's it's a remote control over um the
state of entities in the game. Not when
when we've I've had a number of
conversations about this over the last
year. Um I always and please correct me
if I'm wrong. I always kind of saw them
as like save games like like like it it
was it's you know here's something
actively doing thing and then when it
gets converted into a serialized
variable it's kind of like that's like
the save state file for it.
It's yeah it's exactly it's almost
exactly like that. We we use serialized
variables
understanding what's going on. We use
serialized rules not just for uh
networking but because serializing to a
network it it doesn't necessarily need
to be a network. You've got this
serialization process that converts from
the um I suppose the native format that
the program's running with uh into
another format and it could be the
network it could be a save game file it
could be the persistent database. So we
use serialized variables for those three
things.
Okay. again and forgive me but these are
the engineers and the programmers so I I
am the layman in many things it also
over the conversations it's almost like
uh uh like I worked in a professional
baseball for years and I I imagine like
when the catcher is giving signs to the
to the pitcher short form information
that means long form stuff
there's so kind of compression reducing
the um
not so much on the on the data itself
the the the the
way serialized variables
save us um oh how to explain this. Okay,
so one way of um updating the state of
entities in a game over the network is
to periodically every so often just send
the state over to all the clients.
Um and that can be inefficient because
you're sending the same values over and
over again and nothing's changed. So
serialized variables track when
something has changed and go, okay, this
one now needs to be sent. Okay,
these ones that haven't changed don't
need to be sent. So that saves us a lot
of bandwidth. It's kind It's kind It's
kind of like when my mom keeps calling
me and says, "How are you doing?" I'm
like, "I'm fine. Anything new?" "No,
nothing new." It's like now the
serialized variable is she would only
call me when something's actually
happened.
Yeah.
Sorry, my mom doesn't watch the show.
Uh I I love you mom in case you suddenly
did dad watches the show. So all right
so that's fine callulling that's
serialized variables we've talen kind of
high level let's get into the work that
we're doing right now which is
essentially full client streaming that's
the section of of OCS that that we've
been focusing on right now. Um, one of
the big uh uh misconceptions uh that
that that I wanted to address here is is
the notion that when 3 comes out, when
Hurstston comes out, that that's the
that's all of OCS that it's done. That
that it's there and we're done and
suddenly everything is great. You can
see you like he's just like no that's
not I can I can feel the heat radi of
them right now. Um, we did bind calling.
Uh, we were we got bind calling to a to
to a state where it's feature complete
at least. Um, now we're working on full
client streaming uh for Hurst and
everything. uh when that's done and
that's into your hands and after you
guys have beat on it through EvoTotti
and and and PTU and then even with our
live testing environment which is still
a testing environment uh once we've got
that to a place where we're happy with
it I guess or content with it then we
move on to server uh side client
streaming but let's so I just want to
that's just to help paint a picture
there for full client streaming the
stuff we're working on right now what is
full client streaming let's just start
with a simple thing. We'll go we'll go
from there.
Um, it's kind of what we said already.
I'm not sure what else we can say about
it. So, it's yeah, it's the server
dictating what your uh client can see,
what entities it's aware of. Um,
and yeah, as you move around controlling
uh changing which entities those are
present on your machine.
Okay. So, so buying calling is the is
the tech of dropping things out and
everything.
Yeah. So, client side.
Okay. So, the the the difference between
the the two and how they fit together is
um object container streaming um is
something that we need for Squadron 42
as well. So, a single player um single
player game. Um, so it's very much the
kind of um
traditional level streaming that you
that we see in uh in many games.
So that controls um that's a big So that
controls the uh the
figuring out the distances of entities,
what needs to be present uh and what
doesn't. uh at the minute on the server
uh everything's present all the time. So
we've just got this distance calculation
based on entities that exist uh and then
it can do the um the streaming in and
out. The other part of OCS is the
asynchronous entity loading. Mhm.
So, um, up until now, uh, anytime we
spawn an entity, it happens on the main
thread. Um, and the main thread will
block for how long it takes to spawn
that entity. And that includes the time
it takes to load any files off the disk.
So, textures and, uh, physics, geometry,
and anything else. Um part of OCS is
making that um spawning process
asynchronous. And
by that we mean we tell it to start and
then when it finishes on a background
thread we get the results back and the
entity is finished and we can put it
into the game.
Kind of right.
Right. Yeah. So, um, those are the kind
of the two parts of OCS that that
determining what a client needs to do
and being able to, um, asynchronously,
uh, spawn entities and get rid of them.
Um, binding culling comes in by
replicating those server side decisions
over to um, over the network, over to
clients so that the streaming happens
for them as well. So it's server server
side control of bind calling and server
side control of OCS on your clients.
All right.
Right. Yeah.
Right. So what's
Forgive me for for asking question
Tyler our lead community manager he
takes the questions from the community
and he feeds me up. He's sitting like
people in chat are saying I don't have
any questions. You're talking about all
the things we want to and I've been
doing this for a while. Uh um
the question that comes to my mind is
what's
if we've got buying calling already if
if we've got blind calling as a feature
complete what what takes so long what
what's the time sync here? What what's
what's this it's if you've got the if
you've got the tech if you've got the
technology you've got the code written
whatever uh where where's where are the
hours going
right now?
Yeah.
Okay. Um so yeah we've got the async
entity loading working we've got um the
rangebased decision making working we've
got buying column working it's now
fitting those together because what what
we currently have without
asynchronous
spawning is binding will say okay these
or the what have we got the streaming
manager will say these entities are out
of range for this client you don't need
them anymore buying will relay those
messages, the client will drop them. Um,
and that's fine. But when you come into
range of some entities, and the client
needs to spawn them, it will do a
blocking spawn.
Puts them all on the main thread.
It puts your game launches to a halt.
Yeah. So the changes that we the part
that we're left with now is changing the
the network messaging that handles
spawning so that it can work with this
asynchronous process because the network
messages as they currently stand um
assume this blocking synchronous spawn
this as soon as I've said spawn it will
be spawned um and I can start sending
messages to that entity.
Okay.
But because it's an asynchronous process
we've got to load the files from the
disk. It can take depending on the the
number of entities that we're trying to
trying to spawn. So, you know,
say a whole planet.
Say a whole planet. It's going to take a
few seconds to do. Um, so we need the
client to start spawning, do all its
work. When it's finished, go back to the
server and say, I'm done now. Can you
send me some updates? And then the
server can start uh communicating
information to those clients uh to those
new entities put them in their final
state because things have probably
changed during the time it's taken that
from the time it's started from the time
it finished something has changed.
Yeah. And then when all that process is
finished the client can finally go right
I've got the I can put these entities
into my local simulation and they can
start interacting.
All right, Chris, you you've gotten off
light here, but you're you're uh working
with the QA team that's that's testing
this. You you've been working with what
what what's involved in testing uh
object container streaming. What kind of
things are you are you working with?
What are you looking at? Um, so with it
involving entities dropping in and out,
it's a lot of traveling around, but it's
also finding all the the different
entities, how we can spawn them, move
them, change the state for one player
without changing it for another,
bringing the players back together, like
uh the states of everything match up.
Um,
and we're like looking for all the edge
cases as well at the moment. Um
because it's everything's fine apart
from
stalling when you start loading up. Uh
like these flights to Levki. Uh there's
a stall as it brings Levki in. Um
sorry, I'm losing my train of thought.
Um
sorry,
it's all gone. He you me you mentioned
uh when two two players in there and and
and the calling if if he and I are are
are playing you say we're in a dog fight
or whatever we're we're
a threeperson furball here and I get so
far away that the system goes okay it's
going to callull it for me but it's got
to leave it for him because he's still
in in range. Uh, that's not as easy as
I'm saying as as I as I as I'm making
it, is it?
And and we'll be looking for things like
as you're dog fighting, um, you've got a
mate in your cargo bay throwing a cargo
crate out the back and you're blowing up
Gordon at the same time. As another
player who when he left, you were just
dog fighting happily. He comes back,
everything's different. Does his does
his client show everything as it should
be? Is the cargo crate there in space?
Is your cargo bay open? Is Gordon alive
or dead? Um,
so it's all these different states,
a lot of different states. And one of
the things that, um, I've been looking
at myself this week is
we need not just two people doing it.
Um, two people seem to be quite easy to
keep track of. Um what happens with the
server when there is
people or a group of people not just out
in space dog fighting but you've got
someone at Allosar Grim Hex Levki people
out in space uh people off in Hurston.
So we've been using headless clients
which are just sort of uh lowweight
clients don't actually render the game
but we can give them basic commands. So,
we're filling the server. Um,
the zombies
Yeah. putting zombies, they they do
basic things. They'll they'll get out of
their bed at Allar. They'll use console
commands to zip around the solar system.
Um, so we're seeing what's happening
with the server now. What's the load
like when there's someone everywhere
or nearly everywhere because the player
limit is uh 50 and it's a big solar
system, so you can't get everywhere with
50 people right now. It's uh I I've I've
no doubt and I've heard I've heard in
off-hand conversation uh how anxious
many people are to get this on into
testing into into wider testing. You
know, one of the advantages Star Citizen
has in our development is that we run a
live testing environment in the middle
of our game development and even from
Evocati uh to the larger PTU to even our
live alpha environment. Even the live
alpha environment is a testing
environment. uh guys like you and your
team, you know, QA here in Manchester
and in Frankfurt and Austin and LA,
you're knocking on pipes as much as you
can.
Mhm. But I don't think there's I think
it's safe to say that when when this
does go out, we're going to see a a
plethora, as Elapo would say, of all new
kind of issues, things that we could
never that things that we've never seen,
interactions with this with this system,
the streaming, pulling it out, pulling
it out of four people's thing, but not
pulling it out of two people's things
and and vice versa. It's like that. That
that will be a a very interesting
challenge for you guys to to track down
when that happens. not just going to be
hitting the object container streaming
new issues that have been introduced
since the last time we did a live
release
um other systems other content has been
updated as well. So we're going to be
dealing with uh the bind calling object
container stuff uh working out what's
going on there and all the new fun
issues that get introduced just from the
general development elsewhere.
You hinted at a a good point there.
Object streaming hits just about every
single aspect of Star Citizen. I mean
the everything's got to be converted or
OSR has got to be converted. The
asteroids around Yila have to be
converted. I mean everything that's in
the game now has some kind of
fundamental change to its underlying
structure. So it's not just the new
things like Hursten and its four moons
that that that we're adding. It's also
everything that's already in 32 gets a
fundamental change. So, so new bugs,
bugs that you're finding out and bugs
that you're chasing, uh, can affect not
just the new the the the new content,
but every single aspect of Star Citizen
today. Like maybe only Arena Commander
is safe.
Are we doing anything with her? Yeah, I
don't think I think OCS is touching
Arena Commander yet.
So, uh, is is that uh is that daunting?
Um, yes, definitely. I personally
haven't worked on on that side of
things. I think it's kind of
Yeah, I think the amount of
teams even it touches. So like sort of
um one of the changes we've been having
to make for the uh this the async
spawning stuff, everything all the
components have had to be made thread
safe. All the components of the game
have had to be made thread safe so they
can be spawned off the main thread. Um
for the actor that means all the actors
components first need to be made thread
safe. So you've got a bunch of
components that need to be done by the
audio team, a bunch that need to be done
by AI, a bunch that need to be done on
all these different people. Um, and some
components depend on other ones being
done first. So I couldn't convert, for
instance, the local player component
until the particle stuff was converted.
So we get this big dependency graph that
sometimes goes several levels deep uh
before you can actually get um there.
And there's a yeah, there's just an
awful lot of stuff. There's 100 odd
components on the actor now. Um,
yeah, when you say components, you're
not talk uh backers know components as
the things in your ship that you're
talking about all the raw components in
the most base vocabulary sense that make
up the entire game.
Yeah. So, it's our game runs off an
entity component system. So, the entity
is like an actor. It has an actor
component. It has a local player
component. It's got an audio component.
It's got all these various variety of
different things. So it's there'll be
ones for animation and ones for effects
and all these plethora of different
things um which will be shared between
different entities as well. So there'll
be other entities that also have
animation components and stuff. Um but
yeah everything had to be made thread
everything had to be able to be spawned
for say sorry not
so when I so when I was asking before
about you know where the time sync was
going through and every existing
component of of the game had to be just
about every existing
component. And we've already talked
about how this has been an ongoing
thing. Most of my last quarter, so quote
Q2 was spent doing this for the actor.
And a big big chunk of that was we had a
there's a scripting language called Lua
um that we use extensively in the game.
Um and it basically had to go um because
it's not particularly thread safe or
it's not it wasn't there was no good way
to make it safe for spawning things as a
asynchronously. So um it was a case of
going through for the actor there was an
awful lot of Louis and there was an
awful lot of stuff that just had been
around since this engine was created.
Everyone going has evolved over the
course of the engine. Um and yeah it was
just a lot of tiding up and cleaning up
and moving things around. Um and again
it was by multiple departments as well.
Now, as we're in,
we we talked a bit about how even once
the the the client side streaming is
done, the stuff that we're working on
for Hurst and everything, uh there's
still the whole server side that needs
to come after that. But as we're
approaching the finish line of of our
client side streaming here, are uh what
are you seeing in the game when when
when things work? What what's your
gameplay experience like? Um
I uh overheard someone today use the
phrase truly amazing.
I don't want to oversell it. Um but um
yeah, we I know the um the backers have
complained about performance like quite
legitimately. It's not at the state
anyone wants it to be. Um but we're
seeing uh really
raw builds each day. Like typically our
performance can be pretty terrible. Um,
but now
everyone's reporting improvement. Some
people reporting drastic improvements.
It's it's just it's nicer to test when
you're hitting a really nice smooth
frame rate.
Now, he makes a good point. I I I set
Chris up there. I I wanted to know what
his experience was like. At the same
time, uh, part of this part of OCS, this
is where I get to deflate the balloon a
little bit is, you know, improving the
performance on everything that we have
right now, but part of the reason we do
that is so that we can add so much more
to the game. So, it it's it's it's one
of those things. It's like in in my
terrible analogies again, you know, it's
it's it's I'm carrying a a 50 lb
backpack and OCS is me going to the gym
and working out for for 10 year for 5
years or whatever and now that 50 lb
backpack feels like a 10 lb backpack and
I'm awesome. But the next step after
that is to add 500 more pounds to my
backpack, you know? So, so it's it's
that's one of those things where we when
we say it's not the silver bullet that
fixes everything. There will still be a
continuing network improvements. There
will still be continuing optimization of
of every aspect of the game. You know,
it is a it is a OCS is not the answer to
everything. It's it's a it's a
foundational technology that allows us
to continue building and expanding the
Star Citizen universe to uh well soon
Hursten and then Arc Corp and Microte
and Crusader and then the entire system
and then more systems beyond that. So
it's uh so it's one of So it it's
interesting. I I I don't think we can
predict and I was asking around. I don't
think we can predict you know what kind
of performance players will see with 33
yet or when Hursten is is added yet
because
well we're still working on it first of
all. We're still putting it together but
you know we we we make all these
improvements to what we have now and
then we add more onto it. So it's it's
it's a constant juggling. I think all of
OCS is juggling. It's the server
juggling things. It's the client
juggling things and then with
development it's OCS is like adding 50
more arms but then we're going to throw
75 more balls at it and go juggle it.
What we're seeing now is like you're um
when you're in Port Alisar you're not
you know you're not getting updates from
Levki Grimhex or anything like that. So
performance is great. You go to Lorville
your your frame rate is still dropping
very low because you're still loading
Lville and everything that's in it.
Lurville's big.
It's it's very it's getting bigger.
No no no spoiler there. Lurville is big.
All right. So, I think I think that's
our that's our deep background. Now, now
we're going to take questions. We we
Tyler's been collecting some questions
uh from the community. We also put up a
thread earlier this week in Spectrum
where folks who maybe couldn't join us
live could submit questions. It also
allowed people to vote on which question
they wanted to see most. I'm going to
start with the single most voted on
question. Uh nearly 500 votes the last
time I looked at it. It says, oh,
actually I already just answered this.
Sorry. Uh, can we expect performance
improvements in the game because of OCS
in its first iteration or will it or
will it only work in making a larger
verse viable while maybe allowing more
players per instance? Um, so yeah, I
just kind of answered that, didn't I? Is
there anything else we want to add to
that or is that Sorry, I got carried
away. I went ahead and answered. Uh,
they said they talk about the allowing
more players per instance. That's is
that linked to OCS in any way? No,
that's that's that's not um so the
performance benefits, the memory savings
that you're going to get, if any
hedge bets, your mileage may vary. Um is
going to be purely client side. Uh
server side, all those entities still
have to exist on the server. Uh they
need to be updated when anyone's near to
them. Um, so the server load is going to
be heavier than it has been in the past
because we're increasing the scale of um
of the the solar system massively,
right?
Massive amounts of new content. So, um I
don't think it's likely we're going to
increase server count uh the player
counts. You make you you just made a
really good point there. The these
improvements uh uh when when when this
system comes online is strictly client
side. Yes. So the next step is the
server side improvements and until that
happens we are still adding a planet and
four moons to these servers.
Yes.
So the the load on our server side is
going to increase.
Yes.
Pretty dramatically uh when this comes
online.
So it'll be interesting to see to it's I
think we're all going to be looking at
what the what the improvements are and
how it all works.
Yeah. When that time comes. All right.
uh from let's see um
why are client and server side OCS split
from the live chat like why why aren't
we just working on both at the same
time?
Um
so
yeah okay
so
server side streaming requires um some
extra technologies that we haven't got
yet. So we're by working purely on
client side streaming uh we're getting
some of the benefit uh onto our clients
um and we're not having to do all the
technology at once. So the kind of extra
pieces that we need are uh on server
side stream once um a server decides to
unload some entities what happens to uh
they're going to have to be persisted
out by current state um and then we're
going to have to reload that that state
back in. So, it's it's not clear if we
need the the full persistence to work,
but it's going to have to be something
pretty close uh to full persistence to
get the server side stream at work.
Um how will does OCS affect uh uh our
view or render distance?
It shouldn't do. Um
the as I say as Gordon said as well that
the the range at which entities get
streamed out and streamed in uh should
be
pixel size or thereabouts. So you
shouldn't notice anything. Uh but
because of the time it takes to load
things in there may be a little bit of
popping but it shouldn't affect the draw
distance really.
Okay. Um,
what are the uh what are the current
improvements that OCS has already you
talked a little bit about that already.
Are there any that any anything else
that you guys can can think of right
now? Current improvements that you've
already seen uh from a development point
of view, it takes me less time to load
the game. Um, which is nice. Um, so if
I'm wanting to test very simple stuff
and I only need all the star, I just
need to the PU takes less time for me to
load because it doesn't have to load all
the stuff that's out of range.
So you can iterate between builds
faster.
Yeah. So it's it's less of that.
It actually makes it possible to load
the game as well because the map's so
much bigger now. Not everyone has quite
large not everyone here has quite large
uh memory machines. So some of them
can't actually load the full map. It's
that big. So with uh they need um bind
calling on uh well we've got two maps.
We've got a cut down map and the full
map. They have to work on the cut down
map or if they want uh want to load the
format they have to turn bind colon on
to be able to get it actually in working
on their machine.
It's that much bigger. The um the
reduced memory is helping us as well
with um I mentioned earlier about
filling a server up um which is
effectively using one tester's time
across multiple machines. The less
memory the game's using, um, the more
game clients we can put on a single
machine, it kind of
the headless zombies.
The headless. Yeah.
Um, how deep does the container tree
extend? In other words, is there a limit
to how many containers you can put in
other containers?
That is deep.
Yeah. About that deep. Yeah.
So, there's no limit to how many
containers could be nested inside each
other. Um,
a container. Well, the the solar system
is built out of a root container. So,
we've got the Stanton system container.
Uh, and then inside that, um, there's a
container for each of the planets, I
believe. Uh, and the planets themselves
contain object containers for the moons
and the space stations and the planet
itself. And then on those, there'll be
like for Grim Hex, there'll be the
Grimhex object container. And then
inside GrimHex, there'll be object
containers for the different shops. So I
think we're probably getting on to about
seven levels deep there. Well, there's
in theory there's no limit.
Okay. Uh what's been the biggest
challenge you you've been you've been fa
you faced in the development of OCS?
I I personally I think you're going to
get a different answer depending who you
ask.
I I'm extremely tempted to say
networking, but I'm not. I'm gonna say
that it's probably the stuff Gordon was
talking about the conversion of um
entity spawning over to uh to to be
thread safe
thread safe and and asynchronous. It's
been a massive effort that and also kind
of the production side of things because
it's touched so many teams.
Yeah, it's to manage all that.
uh he mentioned that I was sitting with
uh Luke Hail who's the associate
producer who's who's uh handling a lot
of this um who wanted to be here but
he's actually in a production meeting
right now. uh he was he was saying that
some of the uh dependencies you like
like I need to work on this but in order
to work on this this person needs to
work on this and for this person to work
on this this some of the dependencies uh
uh uh right now are four deep you know-
which is which is which is you know just
to draw the thing it's he's need he's
needing to work on something but he
can't work on something until he
finishes his work on something and he
can't finish it until I'm done working
my thing and I can't finish until you
finish working on the Why are you
slowing us all up?
I apologize.
Yeah, but uh dependencies are one are
one of the the major things and that's
what uh that's what producers bring to
this and I know we wanted to we wanted
to have the producer on to to have that
final uh uh perspective on here just
juggling all those dependencies and and
you know and prioritizing. It's like
it's like your work is holding up two
people's work, but his work is holding
up three people's work, you know, and
and figuring out that prioritization of
where to put resources. Uh that's that's
been a major challenge. How about you
with at the end of this the end of this
chain at QA? What's what's your biggest
struggle? Um I think the fact that it
touches everything means we need to test
everything
and it's not just testing everything
with bind calling because uh when you
find an issue on our say the bind
calling server um is it a bind calling
issue you sometimes you can't tell just
from the symptoms of the issue alone you
go back to a regular server you need to
reproduce it there so you're not just
testing everything you're testing
everything twice uh with it um affecting
things coming and going um these aren't
tests you can usually do by yourself.
You need um two testers, preferably as
many testers as you can get together.
And uh we only have a finite amount with
regardless of how many zombies I can
necromanance. Um so it's it's been a
massive a massive strain on just our
resources of getting everybody we need
to be where we need to be covering as
many things as we can.
One of the questions in the live chat
just said, uh, while while testing OCS,
have there been, what's the funniest or
most interesting bug you've encountered?
Um,
see, now you've said funny, all I can
think of is crashes. Um,
there's been a fun ones where you're
trying to catch an AI who's decided to
run away from you. Um, I think this was
earlier on. So he's in range flying away
and you had an issue where he would
reach um sort of like outside
of uh your streaming window and he'd
stop. So then you you'd catch up and
eventually you'd get the updates from
this AI and he'd fly a bit further
because actually he's even further. So
you're constantly having this little
stop start race against the guy you're
kind of catch up trying to catch up and
you don't even know where he really is.
That doesn't sound very fun, dude.
Um, how will different hardware units
like CPU or GPU or RAM or VRAMm uh
benefit from OCS? Is this is this
something that can conceivably help all
aspects of computer? You squeeze a
little more CPU out, squeeze a little
more memory out, or is it just or only
certain aspects of performance?
But I think mostly it's going to affect
RAM. That's where you're going to get
the biggest save. Um, it should I'm
being a bit more cautious than than
Chris. Uh, it should have improved
things on CPU. It probably won't uh have
much effect on GPU.
Yeah, I I think from my exper Well, my
experience of in the last week or two,
um, there will be CPU improvements
probably, but we're also ramming a lot
more stuff in. Um, so although while
there might be some gains, um, we've
also got a significantly more large
amount of EI and such. That's uh most of
the questions that that had came in on
both the uh spectrum thread and the live
chat have to do with people wanting to
know how big the improvement is and the
and the difficult thing about that is
that like I said we are adding every day
we are adding more things into it uh uh
aspects of the world are becoming art
complete. You know the ship ships are
are finishing up uh you know the we're
adding the hammerhead which like the
biggest ship we've we've we've added in
the persistent universe at this point.
So, we're making all these improvements,
but at the same time, we're adding all
of these new things. So, it's it's hard.
It's a it's kind of like a shell game at
the moment. Forgive me, I'm on an
analogy trend. J Keith is just Oh my
god. You don't have to look at me like
that. I know. But, uh, but yeah, it's a
we will be finding out the the degree of
improvement together is basically I
think this the safest way to to to uh to
answer that question. Does OCS have any
drawback?
Um, apart from the time it takes for us
to test it, that's the only one like on
our end.
You mentioned earlier some of the
challenges that in involved like like
the scanning things like like h having
to put having to leave the markers when
something is called and what so that
people can still see it and stuff.
Yeah, I think um I don't want to
generalize but most gameplay programmers
are quite happy to just assume
everything exists all the time and sort
of do things a little bit. I'd be I'd be
very happy if I just did every single
entity in the client at the same time
because it'd make my job a lot easier.
Whereas now there's a lot of I've got to
make sure every entity I'm accessing
exists and if it stops existing while
I'm talking to it, what do I do? Um and
lots and lots of yeah lots more
technical challenges and more um
it just it just requires you to think
about things. Not not that we don't
think about things, but you've got to be
very aware of the implications of a lot
of stuff might stream out or I might I
might if I'm designing this feature,
will it work when not everyone's here?
Do I need to move it to exist on the
server rather than the client? Do I need
to um tweak things to make them work?
Um, you're good. One of the questions
that just came in the chat says, uh,
after this hits the community, you know,
when OCS hits the community, uh, how are
they going to be able to identify bugs
that are related to OCS and not related
to something else? It it's because you
know many of our members of our
community participate in the issue
council which is our fantastic tool that
you know lets the community you know
assist in the bug tracking and the bug
discovery process like how
how how do we know when something is OCS
related or or it's not just one of the
other thousands of types of bugs that
um I'd say any bug that you spot report
it to the issue council anyway and let
us sort it out. But probably the the
kind of things you're going to see are
um perhaps missing entities or uh stalls
as you approach planets or derelict or
whatever. Um
what else might you see? Some kind of
popping as things appear.
Yeah. Um the likes of teleporting
actors. Um that's one that's kind of
floated around a little bit. So just see
guys just jump around the place um
occasionally sort of issues with
uh one of the questions that came in was
the difference between asynchronous
background spawning and normal
background spawning. I think we we
covered that a little bit. Is the only
difference just whether it's on the main
thread or whether it's on the the
secondary threads or
Yeah, the the background part of that
says that it's it's off the main thread.
the a you can do asynchronous spawning
on the main thread but it's a a bit of a
it's a different way of doing things. So
it's for us it's a very precise way of
describing the process.
Gotcha.
Um
let's see we actually we actually we did
cover quite a quite a few of these. Uh
you me you mentioned that uh OCS uh is
still necessary for Squadron 42.
Yes.
Uh uh how does it play into Squadron 42
just in the size of the the the the the
full systems and everything when you're
Yes. But basically, again, it's down to
the size of the maps.
Gotcha. All right. Um Yeah. Well, let's
see. Uh that's I'm looking for other
questions that have come in. We've
actually hit just about everything here.
Uh is there anything else you wanted to
if you if you could tell the community
one thing about OCS? If you wanted if
you wanted to make sure that people
understood one thing about it, what do
you want to make sure people understand?
um
that it's it's been a as you said
earlier like three years since since we
kind of started work on on various parts
of it and although we've not been
working not everyone's been working on
it flat out for those three years it's
it's taken yeah it's taken a massive
amount of time a lot of changes tons of
people it's it's not down to to just us
in this room or or our teams in
particular it's it's a companywide
effort it's been Yeah, been a long road
and it's hopefully worth it when we
finally get there.
What'd you get?
Yeah, I think just sort of to reiterate
that it's it's touched every single
element of the game. Um,
and it is still currently
it's still currently touching every
single element in the game. Um, and it
is it's I've not it like I said it's a
collection of features, but I've never
there's never been a feature that's
really there's not been as many emails
that have come out to absolutely
everyone going, "Is this going to break
anything for you?" Um, it's needed
everyone to pitch in.
You see a whole lot more BCC everyone.
Yeah. On OCS threads than you do just
about anything else. And
I think as well, as Cloud said, it's not
been a it's not been a short road. I
mean even well before even object
container streaming there had to be
object containers themselves and that
started as I was starting. So that's
three and a half years ago. Um so it's
been that was kind of the the very
beginning of it and it's um this has
obviously been on the plan since then.
It's just taken three and a half years
of tech and improvements
and it doesn't end with this next
release in Hursten. It's
no well I mean this is the kind of thing
it's it's going to be ongoing forever
probably. Um there's always going to be
things to improve and things to more
stuff that he's added to it. Um sort of
the server streaming is obviously the
next major step and then there's there's
stuff beyond that as well.
What about you Chris?
Um just to reiterate that it touches
everything and from the QA standpoint
there's
show me on the game where OCS touch
everywhere.
Um yeah it touches everything. There's
going to be a lot of edge cases that
with our
department like as cool as everyone is
there's only so many of us there's only
so many evocart there's only so many PTU
testers as well even though there are a
lot things that are going to things are
going to break I think um please submit
to the issue council and always submit
your crashes
yes uh that that'll that that'll be my
point that that I want to add uh this is
a massive undertaking that touches every
asp aspect of the game. It's why I
wanted to do this show. It's why when
they gave me one week a year to come
over here, I wanted to use it for this,
you know, it's it's this this is every
department from from UI to to to every
system design, mining,
you know, FPS, locomotion. I mean, every
every game system touches OCS in some
way because of all the conversions to
thread safe and stuff like that. um when
this does get into your hands uh for for
testing whether you're on evokati or
whether you're in PTU or whether you're
still helping us test once it reaches
the live environment um
your help on this is going to be
appreciated uh that this this is one of
the most the biggest fundamental changes
to to Star Citizen that I can think of
in the times that we're being here and
it's not just on the feature side not
just that we're adding a planet to this
which is a pretty massive change
contentwise but under the hood we're
making this massive change to how
everything works under the hood. So, it
will be a uh it will be a uh it'll be an
adventure and I think uh for folks who
have followed our development and
continue to follow our development as it
goes on, this will be one of those
watershed moments when we look back and
be like, "Oh, yeah. I remember when they
added OCS and and everything was upside
down and stuff like that." You know,
it'll it'll be it'll be an interesting
thing to get through. And uh I'm I'm
excited. It's it's one of those building
blocks and one of those growing moments
for the game that that we've been
working towards for a long time. and I'm
excited to to finally
finally approach the the finish line,
whatever that may be. So, yeah, that's
it. I got no other housekeeping. This
was all I had to do today. So, uh thank
you so much, Clive and Chris and Gordon,
for taking time at the end of your week
to be here and to agree to this. I know
it's uh not everybody's fun most fun
thing to do. when I got into video games
and I want to make video games, I did it
so I could show up on live streams with
Jared. So uh thank you so much uh Clive
Gordon and Chris uh for Reverse the
Verse Live. I'm Jared Huckabe. I've got
nothing else to say. Uh tune in next
week, but I'll be back in LA after my
World 3E tour and we'll find out what
we're doing then. Uh take it easy
everybody. See you later.
