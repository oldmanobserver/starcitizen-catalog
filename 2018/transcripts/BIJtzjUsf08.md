## Transcript

welcome everybody to another edition of
calling all depths are relatively new
now weekly Q&A program where we take
questions submitted by you the star
system backer voted on by you the star
system backer asked by me the star
citizen content manager imposed to our
developers the star citizen developers
yes it's a joke I'm never gonna get
tired of let's just jump right into
things shall we so for our first
question the first question voted on and
submitted by backers we are calling
who's one of the rebels become a a
calling all devs all-star mr. Chad
McKinney here in Los Angeles - yeah Chad
how you doing man mm doing well welcome
back good to be back alright cuz we are
starting off with you we've got a
question here one of the most voted on
questions in the in our February thread
we put up a new thread every single
month this rose to the top very quickly
when will persistence log in but alright
no okay when will persistence log us
into the same location where we logged
out like ships outpost stations etc yeah
okay so this is a bug that actually we
knew about before even going to evocati
this actually did work at one point by
there were some changes there's actually
quite a few changes that I happened to
persistence and the way that we handle
persistent data throughout 3.0 release
and it was just one of those bugs that
we knew about clearly identified hadn't
repros and everything for it we just
didn't have the time to dedicate to fix
it was one of those things that we
decided that it was okay to let slip for
this particular release and we are
absolutely going to fix it for 3.1 we
did release a follow-up patch in through
point 0.1 that solved it in part there
was actually a large amount of
persistent data regarding the player
that wasn't getting sent to the game
server whenever a player would log in
and it would make it to where there's
certain persistent behaviors that
wouldn't track across servers that has
been fixed but it doesn't completely fix
this particular issue
so we just need to actually dedicate the
time to it to actually investigate it
and and fully kill it off but yeah this
is is something we've known about and
we're absolutely gonna fix it for the
next release all right so just just to
clarify it's actually not a feature
we're waiting to implement it's
something that's supposed to be in now
it's it's a bug that this doesn't happen
both just like um like say you whatever
signed out Levski you would expect you
respawn and I love ski but also the the
ship's spawning feature our logging off
feature that we added in that and
certain ships you can you can log off
and the middle of space and then
actually we log in and be back where you
were in the middle of space and so that
is something that we worked on and was
actually working it was actually kind of
a Rube Goldberg machine of persistent
data I'd like to get this thing to come
together and we actually had it working
but then it broke unfortunately but yeah
we'll get it working again one of the
perils of running a live game
environment in the middle of game
development I do want to I do want to
add one more thing just just to cover
your butt a little bit you said it'll
definitely be in for 3.1 I want to say
that is our intention to have it in it
is definitely our intention to have it
in for 3-4 but just like we didn't let
us stop yeah we're going out we're not
gonna let it stop that's right
we'll always identify what really has to
be in the Minimum Viable Product for the
release if this ends up being cut again
it's not because we didn't know about it
or slipped through the cracks is because
we felt like there was some other more
critical features that we needed to give
attention to always with the priorities
all right Chad thank you so much for
your time I'll let you get back to work
Thanks all right thank you so much for
that so for our next call well I'm not
gonna call anybody for this one I the
next question that has been submitted by
you guys the backers and voted on by you
is actually how are the mechanics for
multiple character slots gonna work and
I'm actually gonna fill that one myself
for in for a couple reasons one we run
these things we make these shows calling
all devs reverse the verse around the
verse we are doing this in the middle of
active game development one of the
challenges of that is
in the middle of active game development
you are still developing things and one
of the things you're developing are the
answers to these questions now you'll
see a lot of comments from chris Roberts
over the years on either 10 for the
chairman or women saying or 80b
where he'll share ideas of how he wants
that system to work we've mentioned the
past that's a good use for multiple game
packages basically you know every game
package you have equates to a character
slide and of course then the possibility
of selling additional character slots
these are still things that we are open
to exploring but right now there are no
plans to implement a multiple character
slot system in 2018 that's something
that's a little further out on the
schedule so because it's a little
further out in the schedule we don't
have the locked-down
answers for that system no it's simply a
matter of priorities so yeah so there's
basically nobody for me to call on that
one I didn't want to ignore I didn't
want to just skip over it's a good
question it comes up quite often you
guys submitted it and you voted it up so
I wanted to address it this is just
unfortunately the only answer that's
available for this so for our next call
we are going back to the UK for a
question about scheming and my favorite
x-wing and Patriot mr. will will how you
doing man hey Jared I was a guy that's
doing well I'm much better than my
getting over pneumonia
turns out oh it was my son oh I went to
the I went to the doctor and it's like
hey you know I'm not getting over this
you know Zoli got bunch of fluid in your
lungs but you're pretty much over it
over the money I had pneumonia how much
fluid in my lungs excuse me did that I
didn't ask that I didn't think to ask
that okay so you're a question from the
backers this week go
scanning mechanics are scanning
mechanics beyond Salvage in the work so
he doesn't want to know about scanning
mechanics with salvage it's like they
want snow beyond Salvage our scanning
mechanics in the work and if so what
patch are they planned for a one
question they when questions to the left
please yeah okay yeah
beyond Salvage absolutely scanning is
it's in the process at the moment we're
getting the baseline of what scanning is
Kirk's team in LA are doing great work
and just kind of getting that delivered
but if you don't want to know about how
we scan other ships just in general it's
good throw it in there he says he
doesn't want to know but I want to well
no I mean we've got Salvage but that's
different to just normal scanning anyway
so we've got your normal scanning which
is seer ship I don't know who that is
I'm gonna see what's inside Kai thing
which pirates will be using and which
everyone be using so which is and we've
got to kind of all scanning is made up
of two parts
we've got location and then we've got
analysis so you'll ping and you'll
identify with the radars or something's
over there and that's worth my interest
and so I'm going to go over there and
then when you get the thing that you
wanted to know about you'll scan it and
you'll analyze it and you'll get a
readout of what's inside and so that's
kind of the fundamental of how all
scanning is going to be you locate and
you analyze so for salvage even though
you wouldn't want to know about it for
salvage you will locate their links and
you will scan it and you'll find out
what metals it's made up of and how I
can use this to strip it for parts and
then when you're and so other things
we're looking at in the near future will
be mining and that's coming through and
so for mining we will be locating
deposits of resources I want to go over
there too to break up these duh stories
or that field or whatever and then when
you get there you can analyze these
rocks analyze the ground analyze the
asteroids and see okay this has got crud
that I don't need there's too much waste
in here this is a thick vein of gold or
something so yeah we'll again taking the
same phrase to the location and analysis
and that's yeah that's what we're
looking at but I can't really say when
that's coming through but that's where
our heads are at the moment with we've
both salvaged and mining yeah and just
to just to tack on to the one question I
know where we're having a little fun
here it's because the people who are
developing these features and when I
they're not production aren't
responsible for the scheduling stuff
they they do they're they do their work
and so I so it's it's one of those
reasons when we have the thing that
submit your questions it says don't
specify for different people preferred
tumors only ask one question per thing
it's the
people that can tell us about a thing
are usually not the people that can tell
us the win of a thing that's different
departments oh yeah so I figured the
thing that you want to know more about
is how it's gonna work anyway because
the answer to almost every one question
is when it's ready yeah but yeah that's
where these will be the first
implementations of the system so yes all
right so thanks well I'll let you get
back to work
nice um take it easy man like alright
thank you so much we'll maiden for our
next question you know we've got our
shipshape show and we do ship
information there but people keep
submitting questions for calling all
devs and you guys keep voting it so
we're cat working that we're gonna we're
gonna take a question for this and for
this one I am calling a good friend Kirk
to me here in our Los Angeles New York
arc how you doing my friend
oh hey jerk how's it going good good
good I thank you for taking the time to
be on the show again
sure no problem I've got a question for
you I'm pretty sure I already know the
answer but they voted it I'm posing it
to you the question is simply any news
at all about the band new merchantman
the merchantman um so a little bit of
bad news
and that it's effective fortunately not
on the active ship development scheduled
for 2018 last year we did commissioned
an external artist to do some concept
art for us which was delivered and we
approved and we're just under resourced
at the moment to be able to move it into
the 2018 schedule so as soon as we get
those resources freed up bomb will begin
to schedule working on it and get it
released to the community as soon as we
can
and I'm sure that when we do get those
resources and freed up and start working
on it that he'll definitely a fun
community yes good be sure the very
first shipshape when this happens will
be me running from the camera so I
obviously we're working on as many ships
as we can at the moment there and we're
just booked up in the since so many
resources are required to get ships in
the game
is that everyone working at one percent
I wonder you want to follow up on that
you mentioned that we that we did
through some outsource constant work
last year we've actually shown that
those images that you saw those images
on around the first last year when we
did features on the band knew in the
band knew a defender we wanted to flush
out more of the the band new style guide
and when developed in the bedroom so the
defender so yeah you guys have seen
everything that exists for the banding
merchantman at this time so like like
Erick said when when it's time on the
development wheel comes up you can be
darn certain that I'll be right there on
on a on a shipshape Dylan you guys so
thank you so much Kirk thank you for
your time sir no problem all right okay
and so for our last question of the show
this week we have a question here that's
perfect for one of our community
managers actually so I'm going to call
lead community manager out of our Austin
Texas studio mr. tyler witkin
[Music]
reclaimer sorry hi hey Jared good to see
you I'm sorry I know it's cooler than
anything I have in the entire fan game I
mean I'm not purposely putting it in the
frame to show that off to you or
anything and of course the reclaimer
coming in 3.1 so where's the plug nice
plug that's what I do I'm a shill on
Michelle all right so I have a question
for you from the from the backers voted
up on spectrum your question for this
week is why why why why do I have to go
to Reddit to Twitter to Facebook to find
official information that should have
been posted on spectrum okay that's a
good question I'm surprised it wasn't
about the Carrick in one way or another
but let's also tell me about the carrots
yeah I was waiting for that bit okay so
that's a really good question so one of
the things we like to do with our
communication style is to be adaptive to
some degree so what that means is while
spectrum has a lot of good information
announcements ask a dev or even
frequently developers hanging out in the
live chats you know discussing mechanics
or accepting the latest feedback we also
work to provide information on a variety
of other platforms that our community
uses as
now the reason we do this is because
everybody absorbs information in
different ways while one person may
prefer a text posts another prefers a
video and another may prefer something
more interactive like a live stream so
what we try to do is utilize all the
tools that we have in our belt to be as
accommodating as possible for everyone
in our community and so what this allows
is actually some really cool things like
getting to send developers to community
ran events like British and con bars
citizens getting to do a cool article in
a magazine just to really you know reach
everyone in our community in a variety
just drop to the buccaneer off the
reclaimer hughes middle of salvaging it
here hold that anyways anyways so we
have we do a lot of cool things like for
example a lot of our developers will
take the time to actually go on our
community's podcasts and videos and so
yeah I mean that's really what it comes
down to is it's not that we don't use
spectrum it's not that we don't use
Facebook or Twitter it's that we try to
use a variety of ways to communicate for
example a number of shows like this one
so information is everywhere and we try
to be accommodating yeah and a lot of
the information that you see on Twitter
or Facebook or is a repurposed
information that is thought that was
presented elsewhere either in one of our
videos or on a spectrum post and yeah so
it's it's it's it's reaching out to as
many people in as many different
platforms as we can and I think it's
served us very well over the last couple
years so yeah and of course there anyway
it's like you don't spend time on
spectrum you talked to Matt Sherman
phantom of spectrum I was going to say I
mean that sue comes to mind with as you
think about spectrum chat they line up
in the rafters of spectrum wait waiting
for somebody to say something and
rappelling down and saying ah here's the
information and it's funny you mentioned
information coming from reddit well
we're not actively posting information
on write and a lot of the information
that you may see on reddit comes from
places like our videos our streams Matt
Sherman our you know on spectrum so yeah
talk to talk to will maiden about yeah I
posted on spectra but the blow-up before
it happened on reddit so our community
is such an important part of
disseminating our message
you know and and and a lot of the stuff
gets repurposed to all those things so
we use everything we use everything in
every way in every shape that we can and
then I think we'll continue to do that
in the future because it served us so
long now you said something about people
showing up on on podcast I understand
that you're working on something to tell
facilitate that oh yeah yeah sure yeah
that's a good idea I think now's a good
time
so in the past we've had opportunities
given to our developers and to CAG staff
to appear on various YouTube videos or
live streams for members of our
community now as our community continues
to grow so does the need for us to
streamline this process and so this is
actually really exciting so in the past
the way it's worked is people from our
community would you know tweet at us or
send in a support ticket or try
whichever Avenue they could possibly get
through to see if they could get
somebody from CAG to appear on their
show and what we've realized is that we
we love that we're getting invited to do
these things we want to do them more so
we're gonna help facilitate an organized
process to do just that so coming soon
TM to the website is something we've
been working on which is an invite a
Developer Forum and what this basically
is this is an opportunity for you to
fill out a form that says you know hey
what's the name your show what do you
guys all about what's your scheduling
like because obviously scheduling is
super important our goal is for this
process to not impact the games
development in any way so much so that a
lot of our developers are going to be
doing this in their free time after
hours just because they want to which is
really cool but in this form you'll also
be able to request things like let's say
that your live stream is going to be all
about environment art or procedural
planet technology well you can actually
put in the type of discipline that
you're hoping to get from CI G to appear
in your show and we'll take them into
consideration now of course as a
disclaimer I have to say there's no
guarantee that we're going to be able to
accommodate every single request that
comes in but I will say that our goal is
to be more accommodating than we were
before this is going to help us by
taking all the information all the
invitations all the requests being able
to put it in one place for us to really
evaluate how much can we do how
frequently can we do it and for us
to make this process better so that we
can get more involved and be more
engaged with all of you yes thank you
for putting that disclaimer in there of
course it's always there that the
highest priority has to be their work on
the game
absolutely that but uh but no I think I
think it'll be I think it'll be a good
step towards uh towards reaching even
more communication platforms
than we currently do now so yeah all
right man thank you push the reclaimer
back away from the edge of the desk I've
watched you almost hit it like four
times in the middle of this conversation
it's or you could just send it to me
Jared I'm sorry I can't hear you over
the sound of my reclaimer thanks for
having me Jared all right and with that
that wraps up another episode of calling
all deaths I hope you enjoyed it
remember that you can submit your
questions for consideration each and
every week in the thread up on spectrum
and don't forget to vote that is the two
pronged process I say this every week
you got to submit the questions and you
got a vote on the questions and then and
then I'll find the developers that are
available to answer you know that which
let's meet let me add that there if
people like hey you skipped that
question you know it's all the way up at
the top there's not always a developer
that's available to answer the question
it's it's a it's a it's a mix of things
I do my best obviously just like with
today's show with the question about the
the the character slots there wasn't a
developer for that right now because
it's not in active development so do my
best not to not to avoid it to give you
the information that's available but
sometimes when I know there's a
development I've developed it's perfect
for it but they're not available this
week we'll put it off for another week
but rest assured we will get to that
question it's always a always a shell
game of priority so for calling all
Deb's I'm content manager for global
video production Jared Huckaby and we'll
see you next week everybody
thank you for watching so if you want to
keep it with the latest and greatest in
the star citizen of squadron 42
development please follow us on our
social media channels see you soon
you
