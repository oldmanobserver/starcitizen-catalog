## Transcript

hey everybody and welcome to another
edition of calling all Deb's our weekly
Q&A series where I take questions from
you the star citizen backer and posed
them directly to our star citizen
developers usually over Skype and
usually with full motion video not last
week's kabuki foo Mehdi featured
notwithstanding joining us on the show
this week our first question comes out
of Manchester United Kingdom and we are
calling John Crewe a lead technical
designer out of that studio let's see if
he picks up hello hello welcome back
once again once again once again calling
all devs
you were lucky last last week your
segment worked we had two questions were
the video corrupted during the recording
process and we had to do a slide show
from Eddie comic for the thing it's
anyway I thought it was kind of fun but
ultimately it's a video so we're gonna
do video so hopefully this video works
alright John I've got two questions for
you from the community topics I a topics
that haven't had a lot of conversation
about it which is nice you know you
always get that mix of things that
people have been asking for months and
months and months and months and then
sometimes you get stuff loaded up it's
like that's an interesting one I don't
think we've ever talked about that your
first question is one of those questions
that don't think we've talked about it
says can ships docked inside a capital
ship perform their function without
taking off the examples they give our
drone control scanning shooting it
enemies to the open landing bay door etc
etc etc so yes depending on what exactly
it does I'm not going to say yes to
everything but for the examples they're
controlling drones there's nothing
that's gonna stop you there shooting out
the door nothing to stop you there in
the instance of say a scanning ship that
is docked inside capital ship that's
probably not going to work as well as it
would if it is out in open space because
naturally it's inside a great big
hulking lump of metal
say yes within reason all right I mean I
imagine even if even if it does work
during the first implementation the
early implementation that that does seem
like something in a in a Dietetic
universe you'd want to you'd want to air
somehow yeah you don't want to have say
50 Terrapins inside a bengal Hoek being
pushed around is this some sort of super
scanning station what you don't want I'm
sure somebody a share wants but that's
the people on the receiving end we don't
want that all right that's the terrible
terrible arrest Russian nesting doll of
scanners all right your next question it
says ten questions yet - no - questions
my friend when we get you we get you I'm
an ass are there plans for landing aid
systems examples like radio altimeter to
display a real distance from my ship in
the surface that I that people want to
land on or even external cameras on the
MFDs so for the the people that remember
pre 3.0 we we actually had on the 3d
radar when you went into landing mode
you had sort of an assisted landing
that's something we're going to be
looking to bring back it was simply when
the conversion to item 2.0 happened and
all the cockpits got changed from their
old UI system to register texture that
was just something that just didn't fit
on the schedule at the time so that's
hopefully going to come back external
cameras interesting the graphics guys
sort of always pointing a gun to our
head over render to texture on screens
saying please don't do stuff like this
so I don't want to do anything down that
that lines it is a often talked about
point when you say please don't do
something you mean like unnecessarily or
frivolously yes don't have 16 cameras
yeah doing render to texture and a
cockpit all points in different ways yes
obviously everything has a performance
cost and it's a choice and the choice
is one more camera or getting another
player in your in your your-your-your
close field it's we're always gonna
choose to have another player of course
yeah all right man
I think that's it you did good two
questions about it being better boom
I'll let you get back to work man all
right then
see ya later man all right thank you so
much to John crew up next we're coming
back here to a fraught with city we live
in Los Angeles and our own mark abent
senior gameplay super dude mark hey
how's it going Jarrod good I thank you
for taking the time to be on the show
here sure um I got a question for you
about it I think this person might be
trying to sitcom us the location markers
on planets do not display in a different
color orange when they are on the other
side of the planet what are the
technical challenges preventing this are
they supposed to appear in orange is
this person just that's my knowledge
you're not supposed to be changing a
different color but we do have a fun
issue where when you get into the planet
we tend to show everything uh-huh and
that's just an unfortunate side-effect
we do have some plans to alleviate that
with some sort of hierarchy of what
should be shown when and where can't get
too much into detail on that because the
design is still getting flushed out on
that but I know I saw on I think we're
gonna read it they're talking about some
kind of planetary grid to show different
points and it's kind of a similar thing
but as we get closer we'll show you more
of what that is as for what the color is
yeah I think the community is trying to
add a little I guess did you call it
sitcom us but that's your suggestion
back doors yeah it's I think it's very
safe to say we're a world where we're
aware that when you approach a planet or
where you're when you're in the vicinity
of a planet that all the points are
showing up and it's very difficult to
tell which ones are actually on the side
that you're facing which ones are on the
other side we're aware of that I've
talked to a couple people not just you
we do have a couple ideas that were that
we're pursuing basically it's like it's
like an American glad
we throw a couple ideas into the pot and
they all fight each other and the one
that we think will work best as the
women we pursue you will hear more about
this almost certainly in an a TV segment
either in a project update or a studio
update segment on HTV when we have more
but we are aware of it we have plans to
work on it we are pursuing a solution
just not specifically turning them
orange it's yes I can to address the
idea that we show too much although
although we say this now and six months
from now they're going to end up being
turned orange or gonna be like an orange
we could be like hey that was a good
idea good job person's job person I
think thank you so much Marc I'll let
you get back to work sir thank you
take care all right Thank You Marc now
we are going on the opposite side of
Mike's test basically if you if your
stand out marks desk and you looked over
their side you'd see Chad McKinney lead
gameplay engineer here in our Los
Angeles studio
Chad how you doing man hey jae-joon well
I I know thank you for being on the show
I know you've got it you got some some
Scratchy going on a little bit of a cold
it's not too bad then yeah all right
so your question popular one this is the
most voted on question for all of a
prolonged up really fast well over 300
votes what's happening with persistence
ships and cargo are lost upon crashes
and disconnections weren't ships
supposed to persist since 3.0 is the
absence of persistence considered a bug
or is persistence an upcoming feature so
there's a couple things there
persistence is a really broad thing and
so persistence has been in the game for
some time and with reprint oh and three
point one we've greatly increased the
amount of features that are persistent
ship persistence is something that is
also greatly increasing its persistence
but I think here this question is really
getting at persistence kind of
mid-flight and so what we've been
working on is something called a client
crash recovery system to try to address
the problems that happen when you've
crashed or suddenly disconnected
mid travel so usually we have some kind
of persistent saving that happens at key
points turn game plays so that'll be for
instance whenever you land somewhere or
sell cargo or claim insurance things
like that but if you're just flying
previously when we weren't really
tracking the ship accurately but with
this new system we're gonna be doing
that better at the moment the latest
changes to that are in PTU testing right
now and should be out in the three point
one point two patch and so hopefully
that should help address a lot of these
concerns right now this was we've spoken
a little bit of this this this also
relates to the insurance expedition
expedition fee explanation expediting
fee experience expertise fee these these
two things one on one we're supposed or
supposed to work together and and it got
pushed from the 3.0 3.1 billed and
fortunately didn't make the cut in time
but and that caused a number of issues
as I don't think I would have to tell
the community but but it is in three one
two it is in testing right now on the
PTU so hopefully that will be out into
everybody's hands maybe even by the time
you see this episode sure so I mean and
and again with everything this is a hard
problem so I maybe it doesn't work a
hundred percent on this time or not but
it does the changes that we've made most
recently to try to address this issue
will be going in so cool and as I said
if it doesn't if it's not 100% with
everyone - we'll continue to iterate
I'll continue to work on it after that
exactly all right man that's it I'll let
you get back to work thank you so much
bye - all right for our last question of
the show this is one actually for me
being the the ship guy here in the
office at the moment the 600 I and the
Phoenix are on the roadmap for this year
but we have not heard of the Rovers that
are supposed to come with these ships
are these Rovers developed at the same
time the ships are or are they
completely separate pipeline well
they're not a separate pipeline all
ships and vehicles go through the same
pipeline but they are indeed separate
vehicles when we provide you when we
provide opportunities to pledge these
ships through a promotion program you
can you can pledge for the Phoenix and
the Lynx you can pledge for the carrick
and the
you can pledge for the Andromeda and the
Merlin but but as far as our development
they are separate ships just like when
you go to the ESOP terminal you can
spawn them as separate items so they are
developed separately they are not
developed one in the same you'll know
that the the Merlin was developed
separately from the Andromeda is your
best example if you've been following
the project for a while so when the time
comes the the rover will be developed to
the origin Rover the the what was the
other one they have a niche I think they
mentioned the links are over instead
they are developed separately so they
are not currently on the on the on the
roadmap right now because they are not
currently slated to be developed within
2018 but rest assured
just like the Merlin before it and just
like the Archimedes and the Pisces and
the links and everything else to go
after they will be developed just the
same as any other ship it's just a
matter of resources and schedules and
priorities and all that jazz so that's
it and with that we wrap up this week's
calling all Deb's I hope you enjoyed it
remember that you can submit your
questions for consideration each and
every week up on the thread up on
spectrum and don't forget to vote
that's the two-prong thing you got to
submit your questions and you got a vote
for the questions that way we know which
ones you want to see answered most each
and every week so for calling all Deb's
on Content Manager for global video
production Jared Huckaby I apologize for
hitting the table and bouncing the
camera just now I'll see you next week
