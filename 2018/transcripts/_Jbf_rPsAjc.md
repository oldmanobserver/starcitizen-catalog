everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host mark abent and I'm here to
show you some bugs all right so guys I'm
right here in my cartoon land test level
it's one of the beautiful things about
game development is some days the builds
are great some build are just amazing in
today's builds of my amazing because I'm
in cartoon land so in cartoon land I
don't well I got tired of it so I want
to fly up into my Cutlass but first I
got to go drive all the way over there
doo doo doo doo doo but um I can get up
there you can ram into this thing a few
times
ah oh no as you can see on the top left
as I was ramming into the ship that I
owned I increased my wanted level all
because the trains a little off from the
bridge on the bottoms down so when I'm
going back and forward in my Rover it
collides with the ship a little bit and
that increases my wanted level not good
considering I own the ship now the
business mechanic was mostly so that if
you've ran into another player and being
aggressive it counts toward your wanted
level because well you're being rude but
this shouldn't happen in the case that
it's your own vehicles otherwise how are
you gonna get your rover into the
consolation when you have
to move it around to get it in so here
we are in this fun little excuse me
thing called the player hostility
mashing in it player hostility manager
this guy is responsible for listening
things all around the game you know like
hey this guy shot that guy this guy
cluttered that guy some guy stole a
crate you name it it comes into here and
it figures out what the wants and levels
should increase decrease in all that
shenanigans well in this particular case
it listens for when the vehicle I'm in
hits another vehicle so when I hit
another vehicle it checks to see the
speed if I'm actually hostile toward
that other guy and then jacks up the
wanted level if it needs to be so if I
ram into an enemy that's pretty fun so
it's technically fine but if I ram into
a friendly it increases your hostility
however I am technically friends with
myself so that will increase hostility
not good so what we want to do is check
if the vehicle that we rent and rent
ramming into is basically owned by me so
if I own this vehicle I don't want to do
any damage and we do that by using this
food weight gain component which is
gonna go away into a completely this is
an old component we still use and it's
just that it holds some information
that's important to us called the
persistent information and the game
objects key vehicle OOP a is our vehicle
we need the vehicle that we're hitting
we want to get the entity entity worried
for the component
now this guy will have this thing called
a get owner original get on our GUI d GE
ID and this is basically if this entity
ID matches me I own it so if he matches
me we're gonna we're gonna do nothing
because I own this vehicle and I love
myself too much to Chris though wanted
level TM so we're gonna return out of
here so when the game runs through this
if I hit a hostile guy I'm not gonna
jack up my wants level or if I hit my
own vehicle I am NOT going to bump up my
wants of levels so let's hit the magical
recode button and see what magic it does
all right so a recode is done I still
have a wanted level so I'm going to
reset that on the server Shazam I have
no more want to level back up and put
some brick points on to make sure that
the codes doing the right thing we're
gonna move up bit ramp am so we hit my
own vehicle we're gonna see up moment
truth oh I own this we're not gonna jack
up the wanted level and now if I
continue the game gets out and doesn't
increase so now I could go back forward
up down left right trying to get into
position and I won't increase my wanted
level because well I own this ship and
the cool thing and now that we have this
awesome framework when we have more of a
system for like knowing who your friends
are we can easily add some code going if
you know the vehicle we just hit is our
friend
don't inject the wants of you level so
if we have a party or something we won't
increase the water level because you
want to get in your friends consolation
so lots of fun things later on but this
today we least prevent you from getting
a want to level when you wrap your own
ship hope you guys enjoyed so as you
guys saw we had a fun little bug where
if I smack right into my ship I increase
my wanted level which makes no sense
because it's my ship I mean if I want to
tear down my own tree house in the
middle of a forest why should I get a
want to level makes no sense so do a
little fix no I can destroy all my ships
all they want and they won't get a
criminal rating hope you guys enjoyed
until next time thank you for watching
so if you want to keep up with the
