hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse
I'm sandy Gardner and I'm Chris Robbins
this week we get up close and personal
with a new and improved pu group system
and laura makers guide to the galaxy
takes us to Caliban yes but first let's
check in with Ricky gently for a star
citizen project update hi everyone
who's ready for another persistent
universe project update let's get
started we start in the world of
characters a ton of progress has been
made with the facial rig tool you can
see it being used here on an
angry-looking band or
mining is one of the biggest focuses of
alpha-3 to check out where we are out
with it everyone's been working really
hard to make mining fun and involving
mechanic we think you're really going to
love getting to grips with it when it
reaches the PU
[Music]
[Music]
we've also been working on the kiosk
that your visit to sell and refine your
extracted minerals it's an exciting
feature to add as it marks another small
step towards building the in-game
economy the audio team have been doing
their part to enhance future PE missions
check out how this early track enhances
the beauty and calm of a few derelict
areas around the verse the idea is to
set a mysterious and somber mood while
encouraging the player to keep exploring
don't worry we've not forgotten about
blowing stuff up the audio team are busy
wood sound effects too like this probe
explosion the new party system is being
tested and tweaked although full
spectrum and chat integration isn't
ready just yet
as you can see power allocation has been
added to ships how you assign power
makes a big difference to the
performance of your ship systems and
components developments to kortek allow
us to implement changing weather on the
planets you'll be visiting soon in the
pu this is the current state of the wind
on Hurston which plays an important part
to the feel of the planet as a whole
and finally the new guns that we've
highlighted over the last few weeks here
on ATV are ready to go check out the
final audio effects for the Gemini f55
and the cossack armed scalpel sniper
rifle
that's all for this week gang until next
time back to you in the studio thanks
Ricky
yeah without 43.2 you live in the PTU
the first wave test group subscribers
and concierge have been working out any
leftover bugs for the many improvements
in new mechanics seen in our weekly
updates one feature that's getting a lot
of attention is the group system
community feedback and the results of
the poll we launched after the release
of three point one made it clear that
easier access to playing with friends is
a top priority for players yeah so let's
take a look at the new system and hear
all about it from the guys that worked
on it in this week's feature the group
system is the system behind the scenes
that manages all the requests for
creation of groups invitations and
disbands and so that system is basically
the only system responsible for
persisting these groups across reboots
restarts so it's a resilient system that
can live for a long period of time and
manage a high number of groups so we're
gonna be taking a look at the new group
system it's pretty exciting what this is
going to be doing in the future but for
now there's only a certain few features
that are gonna be in the game for the
end user number one what we have is we
now have a contacts menu that lets
people either add players to their
contacts or invite them to party just by
F clicking on their face it's able to
add somebody to a party that way you're
also able to add them to your contact
list so they'll appear there now you'll
see now as soon as I added that person
to my party
I now have an AR marker here which is
going to show them on the map where they
are so I can help find them if we get
separated while we're off on a different
planet so the group systems is two
things it's a replacement for our
current party system to play with your
friends and long-term it's a more
generic solution for any ways that
players will be grouping up together on
the development side we are we want to
reduce the latency and lay and the
chorong as much as we can so that when
the players interact with something and
when make date when they make actions on
it
we don't want to always query for like
across the server services and then get
the result that this will have the
latency to reduce it much as possible
your caching the information of the
party effectively proactively when
before you even you want to have the
information so it's sort of a tool that
other programmers will get to use other
programmers and designers to facilitate
their features so the prime example
right now that players will see in three
two is quantum linking quantum linking
needs the group system or the player
parties to know who is playing together
like oh you me and Joe are going to
quantum jump so the programmer is
working on the quantum linking need to
ask our code ok who's actually together
right now and like what are their
properties of this group this is the
part of the system where we enforce
party rules which means you can only be
in one party forcing that every group
has a leader that if the leader leaves
the group leadership is transferred a
group can change at any time so maybe
the quantum linking is just about to get
started and then your buddy finally
accepts the invite you sent them five
minutes ago and now the groups have
changed the the people in the group has
changed so we need to have these systems
listening for events the group system
really sits in the middle of all these
other services by bringing all these
capabilities to other systems in the
game back in what's more exciting is
we're building this like foundation for
more complicated features in the future
the first one being the lobby service
which will replace the current chap
implementation currently the game only
has a server chat which is per instance
and so this lobby service which is
attached to group system will be able to
provide chat in different settings so if
I invite some good friend of mine into a
party right now like we're playing
together we're chatting up a store and
we have a great conversation there's
good jokes in there and we want to
remember this later this will be saved
on the website because they're actually
directly integrated and this is
something that we're making new UI to
facilitate - as well so instead of just
having the visor chat over on the side
of the screen we'll just like a little
bit of real estate and you type in
we're putting chat into Moby glass as
well so you could manage different tabs
and have like a larger conversation
history there that's visible and with
different friends and contacts is if we
bring up our Moby glass app we can go
into the comlink we have the same
options here you can kick from party
leave party remove from contacts but
what if this also has is the now the
chat function chat function here and as
you'll see it shows up the same as it
would in your visor so you can
coordinate with your fellow party
members wherever you are within the star
citizen universe and regardless of if
there happened to be looking at their
mobile glass at the time or they're in
the you know just running around first
person they'll still be able to see the
same chat messages and the future goal
is all this is going to be directly
integrated with spectrum so you could
type on your client log off and get on
your computer later and talk to those
same friends in the same conversation
thread this will be really interesting
so the players outside of game and who
is currently playing the game they'll
have it access to the same chat system
and make conversation and invite them
into the game it's really giving more
tools to empower community playing with
friends you know better ways to play
together better ways to get involved and
engaged
thanks guys we've got a lot to look
forward to in terms of playing with
friends in three-point-two yes
definitely so it's going to be very cool
to see our players use and react to the
new system and also the implications
relating to other aspects of gameplay
are very exciting so looking forward to
seeing what you guys do for entry point
- yes and you can tune in to reverse the
verse live on Twitch tomorrow at noon
PDT for even more insight into the group
system yeah so now let's go to Adam
Weiser
for a brief history of the Caliban
system in a new installment of lawmakers
guide to the galaxy hi welcome to
another episode of lawmakers guide at
the galaxy I'm Adam Weiser writer here
at the Los Angeles studio and if you've
never watched the show before it's a
chance to remember the war team to sit
down and give you a tour or one of the
many systems you'll be seen in the star
citizen universe today I'll be taking
you to system that you probably
shouldn't visit in a game it's it's a
vanduul
it's called Caliban and it's a location
where the vanduul basically obliterated
500 years of human history over the
course of just two days so yeah if
you're gonna be heading there in the
game there's a little doubt that these
are gonna be looking for trouble so
let's head off now and learn a little
bit about Caliban now
Caliban was first discovered in 23:41 by
Ashley gone
she was a hauler that was working the
Knicks that was working in the null
system at the time when a group of
pirates swarmed her now she quickly qtd
to a different location to get away from
them she started a series of scans to
ensure she wasn't being tracked and when
she did that she discovered this strange
space anomaly which ended up being a
jump point connecting the null system to
Caliban now after discovering this she
immediately went to the UPA u ne and
turned in the the data on where the the
jump point was she named the system
after her father and then disappeared
from from from the public eye even
though she would go on to become quite
famous for making this discovery now
when military pathfinders eventually
went into the Caliban system they found
something that they found that was quite
shocking actually they discovered out
here on Caliban 4f which is a moon of a
gas giant out here they discovered a
human shack that had been there for a
while and there there were crates avoir
of different valuable materials that
were in the shack at the time now this
through Ashley Gon's discovery story in
into disarray people were questioning
whether she was maybe a former smuggler
or pirate who had turned on her crew and
given up this information to the une as
a way to basically get out there were
many others that actually came forward
and claimed that they were the ones who
actually discovered the system that this
was their Shack and they deserved all
the credit and praise to be heaped upon
them for first discovering the system of
course those people couldn't quite
supply the jumpdrive data to prove that
they were the ones to first discover the
Caliban system so even to this day the
mystery of who really discovered Caliban
is still up in the air and you EE
documentation credits the discovery to
both Ashley gone and no now there were
plenty of reasons why the you why
humanity really like the Caliban system
and the first begins with the star at
its center the the star at the heart of
Caliban is a type G main sequence star
which is very similar it's in the same
kind of spectral class as the star at
the center of the Sol system so it's
like our Sun we were very familiar that
we knew we knew what to expect from it
and as you can see here as we we back
out there are even two planets in the
system's green band which was another
reason why we were very interested in
the system the third the system was just
chocked full of resources starting right
here with Caliban one now this was a
rocky planet that we basically ripped
all the resources from in an effort to
build up Caliban - which is which is
known better as Kryon now a Kryon has
the capital of borio which today is is
basically slowly being devoured by giant
vanduul harvesters that are ripping up
whatever is left in the dirt in the ash
of of this destroyed city but at the
time of human occupation bora-bora was
kind of the cosmopolitan heart of what
was essentially this frontier planet in
this entire frontier system the very
edge of human expansion at that time now
it was that dichotomy of mixing both the
culture and the frontier style that I
thought really that I think really
attracted people to the Caliban system
and brought him out there in droves it
wasn't long after its founding that that
Caliban and borio you know had
populations well in the millions and
just that just kept expanding now this
popularity also made it a prime target
during the two foreign wars particularly
the second of our own war where we're
crying on here there were actual land
battles between tavar enforces
and human forces on cry on the the most
famous being the Battle of corn pass in
2605 this was an event where basically
three Nova tanks held off an entire two
varn strike team for close to 16 hours
until reinforcements could arrive and
help help them win the battle now
following this the second devoured war
the the planet was in disrepair and kind
of looking to put itself back together
when another tragic event happened this
one on February 18th
26:17 and as we back out here I'll show
you exactly what it was and on that date
in 26 17 the jump point that Ashley
Gahan had discovered - between the null
system and Caliban collapsed it just
disappeared now this freaked people out
but luckily there were plenty of other
jump points this this jump point here to
Oberon was still was in existence so
humanity was able to get people and
resources out of the system it wasn't
completely closed off from the from the
rest of humanity but the fact that
Caliban did have unstable jump point
connections freaked people out many
people left the system some who had
probably left the system during the
second Department of foreign war just
never came back after that time which to
be quite honest was probably for the
better because only decades later
starting in 2681 vanduul raiding parties
started to hit the system now this was
something that it was it was an
infrequent occurrence but it was still
very devastating very shocking an
occurrence that unfortunately became a
way of life for the people of Caliban
and over the course of two centuries the
vanduul basically softened up
the the Caliban system or the the human
occupation there they explored all the
different reaches of the system until
finally in 2884 they were able to get a
clan big enough together to come in and
take the system for their own this of
course is now known in the in the
history books as the fall of Caliban and
there were at the time while humans were
still here there were early warning
centers set up in the system to detect
when vandals were entering were entering
the system unfortunately those early
warning sensors were either in disrepair
or had been disabled by certain people
who maybe wanted to mask the AE
activities that they were doing in the
system so by the time the squadron in
charged with keeping Caliban safe
realized that a massive vanduul clan was
enroute it was already way too late the
squad leader commander Randall basically
told her squadron that their success
will not be judged on how many confirmed
kills they rack up but on how many human
lives they saved and that's exactly what
they did for for over two days until the
UE Navy was able to get resources into
the system this lone squadron basically
stood up against a massive overwhelming
van duel fleet and did their damnedest
to basically get human humanity out of
the system and to the safety of other
systems
now the losses the losses have never
been officially reported by the Navy but
they were obviously devastating so much
so that the Navy retired the squadron
immediately after the battle in honor of
the heroic sacrifice that they gave for
for Humanity in the system and to this
day that that squadron is known in the
annals of military history as the loss
squad now again when the fall you know
Caliban occurred in 2884 it was
basically the end of human history in in
this system it's it's been under vanduul
control ever since then but there's
still a few other things in the system
that are that are worth checking out and
telling you guys about past a Caliban -
we have Caliban 3 which is right out
here now this is a desert planet that we
were actually in the process of
terraforming to make him inhabitable
when the vanduul attack happened the
terraforming machines that were there
kind of helping change the atmosphere
fell into disrepair and came crashing
back down into the planet so it reverted
back to its natural state where it
currently remains if we back out a
little bit you will see a little step
too far but just past Caliban 3 you will
see a Caliban belt alpha this asteroid
belt is just jam-packed full of
resources that that we spent plenty of
time over the 500 years pulling out
they're still a lot there and we're
pretty certain that the vanduul are
pulling out their fair share of
resources from this asteroid belt right
now just past that we have Caliban 4
which is a gas giant that is you see
it's kind of the greenish gray in color
right here this has silicates and iron
in the atmosphere would you give it that
color again you see the moon surrounding
it
Caliban 4f being the moon up here that
the human structure was found down when
pathfinders first came into the system
and then if we back out even further we
will find the last planet in the system
Caliban 5 which is a proto planet that
we didn't pay too much attention to when
we were in control the system for those
500 years but recent military scans seem
to suggest that the vanduul are strip
mining this planet
no one knows quite why but there's
obviously something there a value or
importance that the vanduul are trying
to go after at the moment so that's your
very quick history of the Caliban system
a system that you could say is maybe a
little bit cursed with all the bad
things that have happened there but yeah
hope you enjoyed hope you got to learn a
little bit of Caliban and we'll see it
next time on lore makers Guide to the
galaxy thanks for watching
good stuff Adam it's always sad when a
system Falls to the Van Daan it
certainly is now if you haven't already
checked out Drake into planetaries
newest ship the vulture take a look at
what this light salvage vessel can do
and don't forget to get your questions
in for the up and coming Q&A with the
ship's designers and don't forget new
episodes of calling all devs err every
Monday where you can submit and vote on
which questions are answered on the show
it's your chance to ask our developers
all your most burning questions like
when is the carat coming out when is it
coming out don't let Jarrod hear you ask
that ok I won't so anyway thanks to our
subscribers for sponsoring all of our
shows and of course to our backers for
