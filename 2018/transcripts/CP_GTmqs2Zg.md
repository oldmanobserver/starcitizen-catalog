hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse
I'm sandy Gardner and I'm Josh Herman
this week's episode features our
squadron 42 project update for February
we'll get a look at the complex AI
systems being implemented in the game
using the massive crew of the idris
frigate as an example but first we'll
get a check in with the developers
that's right let's go to Phil Miller now
for a rundown on what the squadron 42
dev teams have been up to everyone a
film L early designer squadron 42 with
this one's project update so I'll kick
off with a techy stuff while you're all
still fresh the programming team has
been looking into issues that affect the
performance of the game looking into
various ways we can optimize the code to
make the game run better the driving
force behind this is to help speed
things up for the PD release but because
we have a shed codebase it means that
almost all those optimizations still
often help best 42 at the same time
first 42 the biggest wins with the
animations and skeleton updates some of
the best optimizations involve
discovering where the code is updating
items when it really doesn't need to to
help with our detective work our lead
animation program at Evo hurtak at its
debug rendering that enable it's the
more easily visualized objects in the
world they were having their skeletons
updated every frame that enable is to
see what was being updated by not
actually animating the debug feature
drew boxes around anything with a
skeleton with different colors
indicating different issues this allowed
the feature teams have put in changes
that made the items a bit smarter about
how they tell our system when the items
need to get updated we also put in
additional debug information to show us
when skeletons were getting updated but
weren't even visible basically doing a
lot of additional work but you'll never
see and gain from this information the
teams will be made aware of when this
was happening and changed the code to be
more aggressive about when they need to
update downside to this is that it can
cause some cons especially when Cynthia
off-screen does actually need to animate
but because you can't see it it doesn't
it's not coming but these situations end
up as a jail for our QA team playing the
levels of Fanny Willis situation
where the animations have broken and
getting the teams to fix them up one by
one as always we constantly look at old
component updates make them more batch
friendly as well as weeding out the
other sections of slow code and with a
view to making them more efficient we've
also been working on object container
streaming the eventual aim project
container streaming stew allows the CMC
load and unload past the solar system as
plays move around that will allow us to
greatly increase the amount of content
within the solar system without
increasing memory or CPU usage as only
the past are relevant to you will be
present in memory on your machine
obviously this all needs to occur
without stalls
or loading screens the focus this coin
I'm making the entity system code
thread-safe so we can safely spawn
entities including creating components
and loading resources such as geometry
and textures from background threads
this is super important as we will leave
the stores that currently occur when NC
spawn into the game for example when you
currently request a vehicle spawn at
present we have over 450 individual
entity component implementations
everything from gang code such as
weapons and vehicles to the more behind
the scenes things such as the network
component we are working through the
list checking the fixing every single
one to make sure there they are all
fully thread safe once this pass is
complete we can move on from single
entity spawns to entire object
containers loading in the background now
what's the mobi class as you all know as
42 is going to have its own military
version of the device we've been downing
in the look at the UI the visual
elements of the reskin have been
referenced from real world military
heads and cinematic sci-fi references to
further immerse the player into the s 42
universe lastly vital data has been
visually prioritized and improvements to
the navigation system add up to a better
user experience going into the address
where we do spend a lot of time in s 42
you continue working on animation a
setup for Duncan chakma the master of
arms in the armoury area of the ship
good to see you again lieutenant with
the primary focus the best point to
being the fluid cinematic tactile feel
chris roberts showed a whole variety
performs capture footage for the army so
when you get or return a weapon or
attachment you feel like you're
interacting with a real character our
job here included identifying all the
common poses that the actor was hitting
during the performance they're matching
those with the state machine while
focusing on maintaining the maximum man
performance from the actor some of this
performance has already been seen in the
last room event but with polishing of
the assets to a full shippable release
quality in tandem with Chapman's
animations we are continuing to develop
the grab and inspect animations for the
player these are more heavily keyframed
assets as we need to come at them from a
different angle and really take the
players view into consideration more
than we need to do on an AI character
there's still some way to go to get
these finalized but once you're in there
we'll really connect the player to the
weapon and make the armoury a believable
tactile environment now for an animation
update our animation Department on s
voice you have been continuing
implementing word performance capture
chris Roberts shot into fully functional
game ready assets this now means we have
unique walk cycles for a lot of the
people in the game and greatly helps to
our personality to each character we see
moving around you take performance
capture data and analyze it for the
best-case game functional leap we're
always aiming for the maximum number of
cycles possible to keep as much
variation in the walk as we can once the
animator is clean up the motion capture
data and got it seems the looping we
export it into the game engine and start
to plug the assets into the character
specific blend space to see how it looks
and Sid you once the animator is clean
up the motion capture data I've got it
seems to looping we export it into the
game engine and start to plug the assets
into the character specific blend spaces
see how he looks in situ staying on the
address another area of focus has been
on subsumption stability updates for
crew activities we've taken what was
learned during the vertical slice and
continued to optimize a primary and
secondary activity set up wild lines etc
along with further tweaks and updates to
all those logic graphs using the refined
system we are now selling at more scenes
for other chapters in the game such as
conversations between AI that the player
can witness as seen in the vs these are
more complicated scenes that involve
multiple AI characters for longer
periods yes
[Music]
yeah sir I'll let you know there's been
a lot of work going into improving the
pipeline for getting DC's into the game
very substantial system for example
Auguste Beck is the quartermaster on the
Staunton she now has her activity set up
and is in the game the quartermaster
generally takes charge of stocks
distribution and oversees the work done
by the support crew carriers they do a
similar job all the AI usable is that
are in the cargo bay and are going into
the game for the AI to interact with so
we will now see him moving around the
area much more believably checking stock
and generally chatting to other AI
characters finally as part of the
mission set up more of the games
interstitial moments have been worked on
using tech developed as part of the
vertical slice meaning more of the
ambient life moments are being
implemented into the other chapters and
locations within the game so that's it
for me this week hope you enjoyed the
update thanks for watching see you next
month thanks Phil yes thanks Phil back
in December the vertical slice that
premiered right here on a TV gave us a
look at au EE Idris frigate and it's
substantial crew the developers have
been working on some impressive tech
that will help bring that crew to life
now let's take a closer look at the AI
systems working together with story and
player interaction to turn the idris
into a fully immersive experience in
this month's feature
living interest to me means as a play
you can walk around the ship you can
soak in what everyone else is doing like
it's the sense that everyone's got their
own life their own sort of routine their
own personalities as well like so for
example if an AI is walking by a guy who
he doesn't like you know you might not
say hello but if he walks by the player
and he does like the player you know
he's gonna say hi or he's gonna go out
of his way to us all greeting and
interacting them so it's just it's all
like this my new shell this like minor
details that make up the whole story of
what like an AI can do what the III
shows is that every NPC as a meaning as
a background story and you can actually
talk with them they can tell you some
you know rumors or you know each of them
has a different personality so the goal
of the interest was always to create a
ship for people and we want you to walk
around the ship and see these people
going about their lives doing whatever
their role is and generally just doing
worries that they they won't all have to
do so in doing that we have every
character on the ship has their own name
their own rank their own role on the
ship and that's spread among all of the
different disciplines so we have lots of
bridge crew engineers gunners deck crew
even janitors and medical personnel and
they're all spread out quite well
considered given whatever that role
might be and then we have to spread that
out across different shifts as well so
you might see somebody doing a certain
role or innocent shift on one chapter of
the game but then on the next chapter of
the game they might be off duty and
you'll see them in the mess hall talking
to people and everybody is doing their
role on the ship regardless of where you
are so you could be the complete other
end of the ship and they'll still be
doing their thing it's not like they
despawn as soon as you've turned the
corner the day-to-day of a a I on the
address is essentially governed by this
concept of the schedule so on a Monday
all like all this means is that on a
Monday someone might be a marine and
going about their business as a Marine
might do so he might go to the shooting
range you might
to the interest bridge in stangard do
all the sort of stuff then on a Tuesday
he might be off duty so all that means
is he'll go to the mess hall if he's
hungry
you know he'll go and lay down if he's
tired he might go to the shooting range
again if he's feeling like he wants to
shoot some stuff there's also things
like arcade machines if he's feeling
bored and it's this idea that everything
is kind of governed by what an AI wants
to do so you know again if he's hungry
he's gonna go eat if he's he's tired
he's gonna go let down we just give them
options and then go there go do it
depending on what they want to do our
game has this kind of huge opportunity
to be a simulation in first place so you
want to feel real and having a character
that stayed there forever it doesn't
really feel real for example we might
have a Marine who is by default is
supposed to be on a guard post and he
will go to the guard post but if
somebody else is already on the guard
post he may say oh well I can't do that
so he'll decide he wants to go do some
training guy run a shooting range or
just simply running around the ship and
doing that sort of thing we really want
the day I can tell a story to the player
so to achieve this of course there is
not just one tool that can do it or one
feature let's say we try to embed inside
the sub sumption to a lot of different
functionalities so that designers can
create a behavior that can tell a story
and want to have the systemic behavior
to feel real to characters talking the
meso and not just eating three guys
walking together or to jog running
around a wild run they try to keep their
pacing and talk about something but you
also want a mission to tell its own
story so on top of the regular systemic
behavior you might need the story to
follow a specific you know storyboard if
we look at the prisoner scene that I
think is particularly fantastic in the
in the live stream Dead achieves very
well so you arrive to the pilot room you
start to talk with old man and then
there is a moment in which if you don't
interact with the game the game takes
control and he just you know you have
this really cinematic
moment you can look at the face of the
character you're just not listening from
very far this brings more immersion and
immersion is kept persistent with the
fact that you still are in control if
you want to you know move around
interrupt the cinematic camera and then
you can go close to the reason and I
actually look them and they are actually
performing all directions
the mission on that away can also tell
the character's suggestion or what to
perform next so after you take off from
the Idris you want all men to fly
towards the next position in for the
next mission to do right so the
activities I hope we've been doing has
been really interesting over the last
few months they've got a big refactor of
all the guys on the address we've got
guys like Marines engineers off-duty
characters bridge crew all the deck crew
guys even janitors and the way I've been
approaching it is I would sort of role
play a little bit so when I'm setting up
to an engineer other thing like what's
what's an engineer gonna do today like
what's his job
is he gonna inspect all the ship parts
you know see if they're broken if they
are broken what's he gonna do then is he
gonna call up a repair guy ask him to
come and repair it and then like move on
or and all this sort of stuff and once
I've got like this big clear picture of
a day-to-day of what I can do
I'll start setup and I'll just start
from like gremlin like you know he gets
hurt a bit puts his clothes on if he's
not dressed already and goes about his
job designers can actually give
assignment so an assignment can be I
suggest you or I request you to fly to
this position
I request you to defend the player from
this fight this is very similar to what
you know in a systemic situation you all
serve as our wingman commands right
so the system is gonna be very similar
for the player and for a designer to ask
the AI to do something an assignment
doesn't need to be necessarily a full
behavior like a defend an area or defend
a player but it might be a suggestion it
might be I really want you to fly as
close to every as possible so you can
just execute your normal behavior but
you know telling the story that
the Domitian wants you know it might be
that moment all men has to fly next to
you because you are in a very low health
state you know you need protection and
we can communicate these two distant
behaviors to assignments in the prisoner
arrival scene that allows who's on the
elevator doing his guard duty now
suddenly there's a group of prisoners
about to arrive so Lars is then informed
of this and at that point he suddenly
says right well I've got to go down to
the hangar and make sure to basically
guard them as they arrive so he will
suddenly leave his behavior and then be
told that his priorities to go make sure
that these prisoners arrive safely so he
will then walk down to the hangar and he
will basically wait in hunger until this
ship with the prisoners arrives
basically and it'll be the same for the
other guards who there as well and then
likewise when the cinematic scene is
finished we obviously need to seamlessly
blend them out of this cinematic
sequence and basically put them back
into their natural behaviors at this
point like Lars is then given a
completely new objective which is to
basically go off and prepare the holding
cells for their prisoners that have
arrived so after the cinematic sequence
takes place Lars is then put back into a
new behavior and his behavior is then
told that he needs to prioritize so in a
holding cell so he'll then wander up to
the break and then start doing a
completely different behavior she's
getting old part of his natural like all
the things that you see happening in the
either are real our actual behavior
running so from our perspective it's
really interesting to create the tools
that allow you to create a lot of
content that is not faith for example
talking about repairing an instrument in
the injuries that process basically
evolved during our you know development
so he started as a bit more like an
engineer work that you know it goes
around search for object to repair and
then it just reverse them but that felt
to be too much robotic so with the
designer we looked at this and we were
like well you know what it would be
interesting is to try to have like a
lead engineer that goes around expects
objects and then he calls repairing
engineering work so like you will see
him going around
look at stuff and talking and calling
out another NPC these MPC will come and
he will repair and maybe the lead
engineer will be there to inspect that
the work has been done correctly and
this is really what is described in
their behaviors and in the sub sumption
activities and sub activities so you can
imagine the subsumption activities to be
the regular job that the schedule is
assigning the different NPC to do and
then the sub activities are the actual
kind of action so it's like an engineer
can repair something or can expect
something or can just going around
because he gets called you know and and
this is like the way we describe the
flow and the content in subsumption one
bit attack that we made as part of the
secondary selectivity sprint is this
ability to trigger something based off
what the player is looking at so for
example as you're roaming around a place
like the address you know as a player
you might be interested in things like
the engines underneath like the coolant
or or piping that carries power all
across the ship what this tag does is
say if the player is looking at these
things the other AI or nearby are gonna
notice that they're gonna pick up on it
and then they're going to talk to the
player about it so any anything that the
player might be interested in you know
they can get information about it just
just by looking at it you know in the
same way that you know if you were
looking at something in real life and
some of the guy knows all about it you
might pick up on that fact and then and
talk to you about it these the ability
for it to feeding submissions and
gameplay in any way that we won't really
say you know a big explosion happens or
say there's some fire going off as
you're walking down a corridor running
down a corridor I should say an AI might
might comment on that and say like oh
this is on fire because of this you know
and that might have gameplay
implications so the way the PIO AI tech
works is it's basically just a rare cast
from the player and all that means is
just like a line drawn from the players
eyes to any objects right in front of
them so for example the the engines that
the player might be interested in
because he's looking at them this wreck
us would happen a lot of timer would go
off and any AI interested or knows about
that thing that the player is looking at
nearby they'll wait for that time to go
down once it's gone down they'll they'll
get an event and that will trigger
logic to say all the players interested
in that so I'm gonna try and talk to the
player about that
you know I'm given some information
because it seems like they're interested
so as we're building the tech we want
the AI to be more aware of one another
and to react to one another and more
intelligent and systemic ways similar to
this ball tech we don't necessarily want
to know what they're going to say or do
which makes it more interesting for
everybody
and one of those ways might be to react
to one of your only tributes like say
say you hadn't taken a shower and you
you were a bit smelly then day I might
comment on that maybe even take a shower
one nice thing about the older engines
on the Staunton plenty of hot water to
go around one of the things that were
very aware of is how repetitive and
jarring something could be if it said
again and again and again every couple
of moments like lieutenant lieutenant
lieutenant lieutenant so we're trying to
avoid that so spoiled stands for a
systemic point of interest look tech and
it's basically our way of giving an AI
the ability to look at interest in
things so for example an engineer he
might be interested in things like wall
panels that he can fix or monitors that
display the status of the ship he's so
he's gonna look at those things he's
gonna be super interested in him
razza marine you know he doesn't care
about that stuff he's bothered about
weapons and you know the armory and the
brig and that stuff so he's not gonna
look at all the stuff an engineer might
be interested in and look at all the
stuff that he's interested in similarly
on places like a bridge
the pilot of an interest for example he
might look at approaching ships so
because that's something that he's
actively interested in he doesn't want
ships so like collide with him so he's
gonna so as far as gonna allow him to
take a look at little ships and maybe
watch out for him it's all part of our
layered animation systems that we have
so the very basics of that kind of
system would be you'd have an AI
character walking down one of the
passageways and that that's all well and
good but then you might want to have
them
down the passageway whilst also
scratching their arm and that would be
laid on top of that initial walk and I
spoil is a way for us to mark up
anything in in the game as a point of
interest so then the character would be
walking down the corridor
they'll be scratching their own but they
could also be looking up at the screen
as they walk past it and that was really
great because it means you don't know
what the characters going to be looking
at any given time and that makes it more
interesting for us because we don't know
either
every AI has their own personality and
part of what that means is if the player
interacts with AI in like a negative or
a positive way the AI are gonna pick up
on that and treat the player differently
so for example if the player just
straight-up punches in AI you know he's
not that AI isn't gonna say anymore
greetings to that guy because you know
he punished him whereas if the player
maybe fetched something off a mission
and gave it to the AI as a request the
AI is gonna think more positively of
that character and therefore he's not
only gonna say like a greeting to him
you might say like a really positive
greeting or it might stop in his tracks
and try and talk with the player so it's
this idea that every player's journey
through a squadron is gonna be slightly
different you might have one player
whose relationship with Mauro is really
positive
Mauro gives him like loads of gossip and
stuff like that whereas another players
journey might be super negative toward
tomorrow like Mauro essentially as the
player and that's always reflected
through things like wild lines spoil
tech the way I interact with the player
in general a really good example of
spell tech is Monster was designing the
executive officer behavior on the bridge
now she's in charge of everybody and
she's got to walk around and she's going
to be observing people just generally
walking around making sure everything's
going well and that was all nice but it
felt a little bit flat and wooden at
times so you might want to looking at
something but she she would potentially
just looking straight ahead where is now
with spoil tech we could have it so that
if she was looking at a window
she could be looking at a ship as its
flying past so she'll actually follow
the ship and it just makes it so much
more dynamic and just more real and
tangible really just opens it up if you
look at interest documentation online
right now you'll see that the crew
complement is supposed to be somewhere
between 30 and 50 but as we were testing
out the address and the crew and filling
up 13 and 50 people just wasn't enough
food we were walking the passageways it
just felt too empty we didn't feel like
we were gain that sense of vibrance that
we wanted in life so we added more and
more people until it felt right and now
the address is at about 81 people
including the player and to put into
perspective we if you look at the
livestream demo we had 12 people just on
the bridge and that was without the
captain or Co helmsman in there so you
can see how it would quickly fill up
everywhere else as well from a designer
perspective of course is interesting to
create a you know universe in an
environment that is very complex where
interaction of MPC can happen
interaction with the player can happen
from a developer perspective especially
for SSI program er the interesting part
is to create the tools that allow
designers and also ourself to define
this world and define the restriction
and refine the rules where things are
happening and the rules of the game
pretty much one of the big things we
have around the idris and throughout the
game is we have what are essentially
conversations where you can walk past
several AI and obviously they might kind
of wave or nod to you and kind of do
something but there's nothing it's more
than what we call the wild line whereas
there are certain AI on the ship
specific things I want to say to the
player or even to other characters and
say like if you're the player you walk
past a certain character that has
something they want to say to you
they'll actually break out of their
behavior their activity and they'll say
actually call you over and then have a
conversation with you
and these things can actually be seen
but a change in the depth of field with
the vision so if the player is actually
looking at something they will like for
example in the vs demo that we showed
you can actually see liars on the bottom
of the elevator who's he's in his guard
post and when you're approaching me
actually reaches out to you and starts a
conversation with you and one of the
things you'll notice is the camera kind
of zooms in almost like you're done
focusing on the character and that point
we have a conversation we might have
like at the start of Liza's conversation
you will actually talk to you and the
player will respond and then he'll up
say finish after talking but then
partway through a conversation there
might be multiple options for a player
to actually have player choice and in
this case we'll actually pause the
conversation timeline and basically wait
for the player to make a decision and
then based on which decision they make
will actually branch out the
conversations so they can basically go
down one of two paths or three or four
paths depending on how many options wide
line is this all-encompassing term that
we use for anything in AI can do as like
a one-shot dialogue line to the player
or to each other so things like
greetings
bizzy's what we call bizzy's essentially
as a a I say and I'm busy I can't talk
somewhere to B's is another one which is
another thing another term that we used
to say like don't you have someone to be
like why are you lingering around and
I'm doing something
also things like mission comments so
when the player gets back from a mission
say you did really well the players
going to comment the AI is gonna comment
on that if the player did didn't do too
great then the AI is gonna say like you
know I kind of sucked on that last
mission you know do better next time
wild lines add a lot to AI behavior it
adds a lot of life it means that well
it's the difference between you walking
by an AI then looking straight forward
or them looking at the player and maybe
greeting them and and you know asking
them how they are so it adds a lot a
life basically to the address the way it
interacts with all the primary setup is
is very easy it's essentially just
layered on top the idea is once you've
set up one greeting the logic for that
greeting it can be applied to any AI who
has a greet in line so for example
captain white he has greens Kelly has
greetings all our cast characters even
some of our what we call
characters who were like minor
characters they have greetin's and the
good thing about the secondary logic is
that once you've set it up once it can
be applied to everyone you know you
don't have to do that setup over and
over and over again in the perfect
scenario if the player wants to play the
story as we intended then they will have
the perfect playthrough if they want to
influence the scene and the story then
they can still do it and they will enjoy
that fact that everything systemic is
not like a baked sin it's really
something that is using the real time hi
so funny I change his loadout I change
his outfit you will see that impacting
the cinematic scene our big challenges
is to make sure that the system is the
most robust and stable as possible so
that designers content creators are not
worried to bring more content and now
worried about let's say experimenting
with the gameplay because a cool game
it's coming from experimentation and
iteration and if you don't allow people
to iterate then you pretty much are
getting stuck to the first test and then
people don't want to change it and then
it's gonna be like it's not great but if
I now change this script then everything
is gonna break and I want to do it and
we don't have time it's really
interesting for me to try to speak a lot
with writers to level designers to
system designs to other AI programmers
because we want to make sure that
everything we do doesn't have big ripple
effect on the other systems but they
just build on top they expand
functionality it's sort of composition
Matt so you want that every system can
be composed by multiple elements and you
can create more without breaking the
others and I think this is the big
interesting challenge of star citizen
as you can see the cutting-edge AI tech
integrating with cinematic moments aims
to give players an experience that's
story driven but also extremely personal
and adaptable we'll have another
squadron 42 project update for you next
month that's right and in the meantime
you can head to the games webpage to
sign up for the dedicated newsletter
check out past updates and stay on the
frontlines of development this weekend
will be our last chance to supersize
your star citizen starter package and
add squadron 42 for just $15 the price
for the upgrade will increase on Monday
so grab both games and take advantage of
this special while you still can in star
citizen news this week the pu teams
branched to alpha 3.1 is planned and
continued to stabilize and gear up for
deployment to evocati as we get closer
to release you can always stay up to
date on what we're planning for that
release and beyond with the live road
map on our website last week's
installment of shipshape introduced the
first new concept ship of 2018 the ages
Vulcan this versatile utility ship will
be an entry point for star citizen
players interested in support roles with
