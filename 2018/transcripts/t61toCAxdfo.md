hello and welcome to another episode of
our round the verse i'm sandi gardiner
and i'm chris roberts today we'll dive
into in-game chat scanning prosthetic
limbs and some useful back-end tools but
first we have news on the state of
object containers streaming and alpha
3.3 yes so both alpha 3.3 and object
container streaming have now spent some
time in the hands of the other catty and
the good news is OCS object contain
streaming is performing much better than
anticipated and we're seeing frame rates
well not all of them but some up in the
triple digit range which is pretty
awesome
with these huge increases we've
redistributed developer bandwidth by
shifting focus exclusively to our build
that includes OCS this means instead of
releasing out for 3.3 without OCS so the
live servers at citizencon we've decided
instead to open the PTU to all backers
on october 10th with a bill that
includes OCS and all the performance
gains that comes with it this will allow
us to get the content and improvements
into your hands even faster than we
would have done with the other plan
Hurston a lava will soon be added
afterwards in an incremental 3.3 patch
very cool so 3.1 and 3.2 we're
date-based
releases what happened with 3.3 object
container streaming is a foundational
technology for the game it's one of the
the big remaining things that we've got
to get working properly originally it
was sort of iffy whether it was going to
make the date so he said well we're
going to shift it at the same time
putting two builds out in the hands of
our vacati members and ultimately the
rest of the community to test it but
when we went out there a couple of
things happen one the ever catty were
really quite excited by the potential
performance gains and of course we were
too because it was nice to sort of see
it validated properly in the real world
you know you guys should the other
aspect of is we're doing stuff at a huge
amount of detail on fidelity so we had
to do a full refactor of the system
because the most games if you play games
and streaming happens a lot in sort of
single-player games where they know
which way you're going so they sort of
starts a stream the level that's ahead
of you in as you get towards it but it's
very linear know exactly where the
players going with us we don't know
where the player because you can go
anywhere in the star system and then on
top of that
you need to stream a load in the object
containers in the background while
you're still playing the game and so
everything that does the loading of not
just the textures the models but the
data format you know the objects that
all the entities that are contained in
these object containers has to happen in
the background multi-threaded so we had
to do a huge pass over all the game code
because a lot of the game code in
lumberyard assumes you're just running
on the main thread we have to do a lot
of initiation of all the entities and
all the loading and everything all has
to be on you know background worker
threads it's a pretty monumental amount
of engineering we working on the
foundations of this for a couple of
years and so this is easily as big if
not bigger than 64 from 32 bit precision
the 64 bit precision we did a few years
ago because it's multiplayer and I have
freedom of choice that it makes it more
complex on the back end in your yeah and
it's writing behind the scenes because
you don't know which way I'm gonna go
and so it makes the engineering more
complicated on the back end most
single-player games they know where
you're going and so that transition is
much easier to program on the game code
yes whole development stuff we had a
sort of come to Jesus meeting on Monday
where it felt you know people were
having too much context switching going
between this branch and this branch
which branch meant fixing stuff in so
you've now you've now focused in 23.3
with OCS yes so we made it that we made
a decision to try and focus all the
resources on to OCS because ultimately
that's what we're we want to be anyway
no matter what and we also feel like
that will be better for three point four
we live is this imaginary point for why
we feel like this will be better for
three four I mean we still want to be
patron day driven on three four so have
it by the end of the year and not
wasting time on the non OCS branch which
is essentially a dead branch means that
we'll we'll be having resources
dedicated to the three for sooner
because they won't have to you know be
still trying to fix up OCS because we
started on it late because
try to get the non OCS out first alright
looking to our community our Spanish
fans have been at it again yes they
certainly have this skynet group just
organized an impressive 50 person space
panel they entered the hall affair by
lining up all 50 participants and firing
the prospectors mining laser through all
of them ouch hey well we're gonna have
to start putting a safety warnings on
those things obviously it's not having
meant to be used now on to development
updates the gameplay feature and UI
teams have been working on ongoing
improvements to the in-game chat system
recent updates include new channels and
settings and an updated visor display
VoIP continues to be tested as we get
the feature ready for its upcoming debut
ya internal testing is ramping up we'll
get a look at VoIP as well as fight at
citizencon next week of course with
alpha 3.3 currently in the PTU we've
already seen some of our ever Katzie
testers trying out the tech and testing
it themselves meanwhile deaths continue
to polish the improve scanning system
right now the system is being fleshed
out differentiating between things like
my novel assets and ship identification
is key with the expansion of scanning
capabilities we've been working on a new
tool that will help our artists present
their work for internal review in the
most efficient way possible
let's go to Forrest Stefan for a
walkthrough of the new back-end tech I
want to take you through a new tool that
we have developed titled the look
development tool so let me go ahead and
just grab this lamp basically with a
click of a button it hides everything
that's inside of the environment and
then it just shows what we wanted to
show which is a very simple light setup
in a very simple room once we have the
model in to look Deb mode we have a full
feature set we have the ability to do
turn tables we have the ability to
change kind of the lighting condition we
also can kind of look at reflection
passes so with a click of a button your
an hour of time and this tool also
ensures that the developers are all
reviewing the different assets in the
same environment so it creates a sense
of cohesiveness during the review
process so the last thing that we can
look at I'm outside of grim pax you know
maybe an artist wants to take a look at
the Hornet in a isolated lighting
condition so I'm gonna go ahead and just
jump in the looked up mode somebody
needs a turntable the fact that I'm in
Luke death mode I'm gonna go ahead and
skip the whole process of building a
track view in a camera rig etc and so
forth and I'm gonna go ahead and just
toggle my capture 60 frames per second
sets my path hit OK and now it's
automatically capturing a turntable for
me it's not a feature that's for the
game it's a feature that's for the
development of the game it's an
efficient means to get the asset
approved faster and that means the
faster we can get approved faster we can
get into the build the faster we can get
it on your computers to play with these
assets and that's kind of the advantage
of this tool so it seems like this tool
will be great for developers but what
about for the game itself and for the
players well it's gonna help the game be
more balanced which is really important
because we have PPR which is physically
based sort of rendering and so therefore
the actual materials have made to
respond to certain different kind of
light levels and so if you've got an
artist that's built one to a different
lighting setup than one that's built
over here you put them together they
don't fit so while this is going to
enable us to do is ensure that we have
less clashes in the end result so this
prevents that and also creates tools
that are better for review so setting up
the asset with lights and animation so
you can see it takes a bit of time so
this will mean that developers can sort
of iterate faster and provide more
consistent assets I like it very cool
moving to grim hack station where forest
parked his ship in that last bit the
elevator system has finally been fixed
this recent dev work should lead to a
significant decline
elevator based casualties in the area
I'll be a good thing so on the backend
we've improved the flash tools our UI
developers used to allow for on-the-fly
changes without having to reload the
game world in the editor here is UI
creative director zane bien with more so
over the past couple of months we've
been working on developing some new
authoring tools what that is is having a
standard API in which gameplay
programmers can easily expose variables
that we can hook into with the UI the
other aspect we've been working on that
we turn building blocks and that's
basically a first foray into the
authoring tool that allows artists and
designers to easily place UI elements
into the game world currently what we
have to do right now is wire framing and
prototyping in a separate program then
that gets translated into Photoshop and
then that then has to get translated
into flash which finally gets translated
into the game engine so one of the
eventual goals that we want to get to
with this tool is to be able to shift
our entire workflow into the game engine
so using the same tools to prototype to
mock things up and to implement using
the same tool set as as the actual
implementation then it would save us a
massive amount of time and we're talking
about weeks down to days for any
particular new UI that we need
in the game so anyway this is another
example of some work that we're doing to
increase our pace of iteration our UI
team as they're iterating on assets very
quickly you know without having to
reload the whole game and you know
that's five minutes every time they want
to do an iteration here it can happen
instantly so we're working pretty hard
on tools to try and increase our
development velocity which is a good
thing
yes we like that the tech art team has
recently rigged mission giver Battaglia
is prosthetic leg touches like this add
a lot to characters filling in their
backstory visually like how did she lose
that leg I'm sure there's probably a
crazy story there right probably you
know Steven had a cap I don't know
myself either but I am looking forward
to seeing he ran out for three point
three and that's it for this week don't
forget to tune in to reverse the verse
live tomorrow at noon pacific on Twitch
citizencon is next week and if you won't
be joining us in Austin on October 10th
make sure you tune in to the live stream
all you need to do to join is have an
RSI account yes and since we'll be at
citizencon and all working to get alpha
3.3 ready for prime time around the
verse is going to be taking a break next
week yes but we will be back after
citizencon thanks to all the subscribers
and of course to all of our backers and
until then we will see you around
