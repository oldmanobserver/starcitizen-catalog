## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse i'm sandi gardiner
and i'm chris roberts this week we have
an in-depth studio update from foundry
42 in frankfurt germany yes they'll be
giving a closer look at some of the work
they did on the squadron 42 vertical
slice and we'll see some of the new
optimizations of backend tech they've
been working on for both squadron and
star citizen let's check in with Brian
chambers now and see what the Frankfurt
team has been up to
hello everyone my name is brian chambers
development director of foundry 42
frankfurt office since our last studio
update teams grown by a few people
played eNOS currently adds 79 people
strong the end of last year was a big
coordinated global effort to get 300 out
to everyone as well as wrapping up bits
for the end of the year squadron 42
vertical slice playthrough
the team then took a couple weeks off
for the holidays and everyone came back
recharged and ready to focus on their
next tasks once back the first of the
year involved a large amount of
scheduling and planning across most all
disciplines laying out the plans to
distribute work amongst the various
offices and the most efficient way
possible since January was a lighter
than usual month in regards to work time
due to the holidays this update will
include some items from the previous
update but with a bit more detail and
visuals to accompany him so let's first
check in with the VFX team the most
recent work for the de VFX team was
focused on s42 vertical slice they
contributed to the coil volumetric cloud
and an exterior effects to the slaver
based on Gainey and specific bespoke
effects for the cinematic sequences the
slaver bases exterior was dressed in
suitable effects for the dusty planet
service and low technological style and
the cinematic effects were as bespoke
for the various cutaways in the vertical
slice the work on the coil gas cloud
tech went through a good amount of R&D
with the team they were focused on
developing new methods to create an
interior volume well keep it in line
with the defined and approved concepts
and art direction the process they used
for the coil involves software called
Houdini which is not natively supported
in lumberyard so a portion of their time
was spent on developing optimizing and
integrating that to the new pipeline the
entire process went through numerous
iterations and for the final look they
paid really close attention on how the
interior
interesting compositions and vigils for
the players well flying the past couple
of months have been very productive for
the AIT
with a split focus on both squadron 42
and the star citizen PU during the
squadron 42 holiday livestream we were
able to show a first version of the
human combat on foot to prep for this
the team spent some time refactoring all
the cover movement transitions inside
the movement system the system now
includes an improved path analysis by
the AI so that NPCs will know more in
advance which type of animation should
be played enabling us to better smooth
the transitions from locomotion to
special transition animations if and
when needed
ship AI was also given some attention
during the past month during the s 42
reveal we were able to show our first
version of the updated spaceship
behaviors currently our movement system
is now in control for both on foot and
flying movement requests and submissive
controlling the pilots and seat operator
behaviors the AI ships are now actually
fully controlled by the NPC's sitting in
the operator seats and each operator has
specific behaviors to use the items they
have control of regarding subsumption
they introduced several new
functionalities the new sub sumption
event dispatcher the master graph the
dynamic track view implementation the
substantive vent dispatcher is a way to
fully support the subsea vents without
relying on any other external systems
it's composed by a central system that
allows user code to create and send an
event the events are created in a pool
to allow the AI system to efficiently
handle and reuse the allocated memory
and each signal lifetime is
automatically managed by specific
structures called handlers that also
allow fast access to the signal itself
user code can specify a direct event to
an entity or send an event to all the
entities in a range from a specific
location sending events and arranges now
as
zone safe and all the code efficiently
uses zone system for special queries and
entity filtering the master graph is a
way for building a relationship between
multiple subsumption activities we want
to have a general way for handling
specific assignments requested by
designers as well as combat and regular
activities the master graph allows to
specify transitions between our
scheduled activities and other logic
that should be executed when specific
events are received they also provided
support for dynamic track view scenes a
dynamic track view scene is a cinematic
scene where the participants can be
replaced at runtime with actual AI NPC's
this allows us cinematic designers to
work on their scenes in a controlled
environment but also allow level
designers to populate their levels with
NPCs that might have or need different
activities such as specific clothing or
other customizations all the changes in
the character might influence the NPC
characters and become part of the
cinematic scenes also dynamic track view
scenes can be potentially interrupted so
the AI system needs to know how to take
over if and when that happens closing
out 2017 the lighting team was focused
entirely on the squadron 42 vertical
slice for the holiday livestream with
lighting generally coming in at the end
of an art pipeline a lot of effort needs
to be placed on showcasing key moments
from specific areas establishing shots
framing points of interests and
improving readability for gameplay with
some things being worked on right up to
the deadline this is no easy task but
the experience was extremely useful and
provided the team with ideas for better
tools and workflows going forward to
ultimately improve the player experience
enter in 2018 while continuing to
support ongoing work for squadron 42
they begin training a new lighting team
member of the team who will help
finalize our legacy lighting conversion
process to the new volumetric fog
technology and also polish and build on
new content in the pu initially this
will involve building
lighting language for the upcoming
modular trucks top features since these
truck stops won't always be hand-built
we need to build processes to
automatically place lighting an
environment that feels believable is
light on performance and obviously
bug-free last month the FPS weapons art
team continued to work on the gemini f55
LMG and the tour all aggregated kay
hicks missile launcher both of which are
now finished with their first art pass
similarly the ship weapons our team
completed their first art pass for the
ANR laser cannon size 1 through 6 and
the Gallants and tactical ballistic
Gatlin's size 1 through 3
they started blocking out the laser beam
weapon size 4 through 6 for the Trident
attack systems and the distortion
repeater size 1 through 3 for the
Associated science and development
manufacturer teams also been working on
scripts and tools to help further speed
up their art pipeline one such script is
a ship weapon tool which was made to
assist in the creation of modular
weapons this new tool lets us create a
larger number of weapons in a smaller
amount of time by allowing artists to
preview different component setups in
real time and to automate the export
process directly to the game engine all
animation exports and engine related
meta files are handled by the script
leaving the artist to mainly focus on
making the actual art itself for the
cinematics team based here in Frankfurt
it's rare that I can actually go into
detail in their progress since we're
doing our best to keep the full squadron
42 story surprise since we recently
showed portions of squadron 42 in our
holiday livestream I thought we would
take the opportunity to go into some
detail on what was done with the
cinematics that were shown
so here's Hanazawa our cinematic
structure to give you an update with
squadron 42 being such a narrative and
cinematic heavy game the cinematic team
was responsible for quite a bit of the
content in the December review as well
as pushing tech to make it all happen
for the livestream
today we will go into more detail about
what it takes to create some of these
scenes before players get to walk to the
ship and launch we are witness to the
arrival of the OMC prisoners onboard the
UAE s standing for that we actually
scaled one of our characters wet tag
akka who's played by Craig Fabrice the
bronze to Karen's brains so to speak up
to be more in line with his actual
real-life intimidating self that meant
careful adjustments to the performance
capture solve so it all lines up with
the environment and other scene members
I'm Owen Robertson among the senior
cinematic animators here at foundry 42
frankfurt i was responsible for working
on a couple of the scenes from the demo
that we showed in december always talked
about one of the the issues that we had
with scaling one of the prisoner
characters one of the issues is that
it's not just the characters model it
gets scaled but also the skeleton as
well and therefore the animation gets
scaled that means when a character moves
on set and that animation gets scaled
they're no longer in their correct
position which means that they might not
interact with the character properly or
they don't they can't interact with the
environment properly so we need to
adjust for that in the animation so the
way we resolved this issue was to first
scale up the character and then apply
the inverse of that scale to anything
that effect their translation or
movement through the scene and have an
example I had to show you okay so here I
have a portion of the scene I was
working on with tag occur and the two
other prisoners and Tokiko walks up and
stands directly between the two other
prisoners
and this is before he's been scaled so I
can see that his height is the same as
the other characters and he doesn't look
quite as imposing as we would like him
to so the first step was to scale up the
character so we decided we wanted scale
by 10% when I do that
he's now larger but also his position
has shifted and he's not where he should
be on set so the way we resolve this
issue is we apply the inverse of that
scale to anything that affects his
translation through the scene so in this
case we'd select his route controller
his pelvis and both feet in the curve
editor we need to select the translation
tracks in the X and z plane I'm not
worried about the Y plane I can adjust
that later
for all those controllers and now the
question is how much scaled we need to
apply to bring that back to the original
performance so the amount of scale we
need to apply is the reciprocal of the
original scale factor of 1.1 and we can
work that out quite easily by doing 1
divided by original scale 1.1 that gives
the value of not point 9 0 recurring so
I'm going to copy that select my
animation curves and apply a value scale
of that amount and when we scale those
keys
Terri's now back in the correct position
but he's also at the correct scale that
we wanted and everything looks much
better and then that's that's Israeli at
that point did he like final polish pass
and then hand it off to the cinematic
designers it also meant a couple of
measure justments on the Argo pot door
and landing gear which the ship team did
so the performance capture would then
work to get the most out of this
foreboding scene we also wanted a darker
based lighting for the aft section of
the idris hangar we sunt with the ship
art director and introduced a lower
light state for that section of the ship
that is a lot moodier than the default
based lighting once this light state was
done we took that as our starting point
and set up additive cinematic lighting
to finalize the scene
[Music]
all right let's get them out of there
Eddie up Naga get the door
[Music]
now I've never been on one of these it's
nice not as nice as a Bengal but nice
movie I'll come on clearer what no
please
MCS gonna have to teach you screw-top
some manners are you looking to start
trouble always is the trying to get a
rise up did I'll get a rise out of your
elbow that's enough let's go over there
the big ones coming out no she saw the
moose
relax son
I'm sorry yes ain't like we're gonna be
here long
they'll are there gonna be a long Eva
what the hell you were going on about
it's very simple where I don't say
and our MC belongs to circle the sokar
doesn't like
Missy movies things coming
saticon say your boss we're supposed to
be scared of him or something yeah Noel
run up to the holding cells make sure
everything's ready for us I don't to
move them through the ship until we have
to aye sir
thanks doctor processing aye aye sir
one single muscle
I'm gonna give super bloggers
information to make you regret it
pleasure
the launch sequence of the Gladius
fighters was a big set piece that
required a lot of new tech and code
improvements to make it all happen we
aimed for elements like a real AI old
man inside his real AI ship the deck
crew as AI the signaling from the player
the air traffic control officer to be
done in a proper way that would push
feature development on the game further
along for that we work together with AI
engineering and our cinematic tools
engineers as the launch sequence also
meant more work for our Trek Funes
spline that spline actually allows us to
puppeteer AI ships precisely and we had
to make it work going from the interior
zone of the hangar to the outside Shubin
space seamlessly we also work together
with engineering on several features
that help enrich our game cinematically
we prototyped and then enabled and
always on out of focus f-stop based
depth of field
mostly for non-combat situations that
adds a lot of filmic realism to walking
around and exploring interiors like the
stand in a dress corridors we are
currently in the process of dialing in a
rule set for this and how strong the
depth of field will kick in under
certain circumstances another bit of
tech that came online late last year was
the ability to use light groups as
cinematic light layers for our scenes
any scene can be tagged up and a
corresponding light layer can be
triggered to be faded in aid of a
default or custom individual timing per
light coming online this can be a light
rig for scene but it can also be per
location both are viable we called it
our Cinna lighting rig and it helps to
push hero scenes further than what the
environmental based lighting would give
us for big scenes like the briefing with
captain wide or trails rescue on Gainey
base we are doing what we are calling
gold standard sequences this is a linear
cinematic master take on the sequence
with the most likely dialogue it's pre
chosen and linked together to show all
departments working on that part we want
to achieve with the actual in-game
version of that scene running with all
the AI characters online and all bells
and whistles active it helps animation
tiling in all the transitional Clips the
facial post matches it is integral for
lighting and visual effects for the
scene and it shows how everything should
behave when it all comes together it
also informs level-design about
potential needs for environment
funneling or staging of
player once the gold standard is done we
shift the scene over to systemic I our
conversation system or subsumption
behaviors and compare that to the linear
gold standard to see if we're happy with
the end results scenes like the briefing
with captain wide were also used to
prototype and develop our workflow to go
from and back to subsumption II I
control and to and from track view I
sincerely appreciate the offer captain
but you've done enough already
humans more than capable of handling the
situation we're already dispatched as
security forces and I'm sure they'll
find the star fair and you miss uncle
Anthony mr. Wexler I wasn't seeking your
approval on the matter I was merely
informing you of my intent out of
courtesy while your involvement is
welcomed and strongly encouraged it is
entirely optional our involvement
whoever is not Lee's onc attacked a Navy
ship and ueb space until the threat is
neutralized the Stanton will be
remaining at Shubin and we will be
assisting in rescue operations you're
not listening captain human Andrew
sellers are very important company in
the UAE this is coming with many many
connections I'm sure that High Command
is gonna be very disappointed to hear
this overprotective thuggery well I look
forward to hearing from them thank you
for your time mr. Wexler
well you were right Colton that man is a
complete ass white protest so art
against our help
oh you'd be surprised a lot of these
distance station see paying protection
of various gangs as a standard cost of
business excellor knows that with us
here we'll be forcing a fight that means
unknown risks which brings us back to
the mission at hand
take a seat lieutenant the Stanton will
be staying in this current position to
offer protection to the civilian support
Shubin station while you do a full
offensive sweep of the surrounding area
to clear out any remaining O&C
capture if possible treat them as an
extremely hostile threat and the missing
star fair that will be your secondary
objective we've arranged your patrol in
a search pattern Brown the wreck site as
soon as you clear the coil I want you to
contact agent rail hopefully we can find
whether star Farah could have headed
after the attack Webb what's the word in
scanner Raptor aides just finishing sir
we should be better able to handle the
interference from the coil now well done
weapon hopefully that'll help you find
the star fare and any outlaw still
lurking out there as soon as you're
ready I want you to launch and begin
your sweep once the prisoners arrived
aboard we'll see if we can get any
useful information out of them and keep
you updated good luck and dismissed
I better get down to the hangar then
adjust my loadout see down there kid
[Music]
lieutenant I know you're about to head
out but I've been meaning to ask are you
finding the Staunton so far fine it's
been good sir let her hear it
Stanton's a good place to start a career
she was my first posting too she's a
hell of a ship this one Kelly said you
performed well on your last mission
that's quite an auspicious start tell me
about yourself do you have family idea
yes sir I do
that's good having responsibilities
outside the Navy Hobbs ground you're
thinking inside of it but be careful
time is one of those funny things the
early again the faster it seems to go
last time I saw my son he was getting
his equivalency next week was graduating
college I couldn't tell you where that
time went for days I know that you're
trying to make a career for yourself
but don't let it get in the way of the
rest of your life that's good advice
thank you sir I'll remember that you
should do the same thing sir have you
thought about seeing him that would be
complicated
I've kept it too long you're dismissed
lieutenant
[Music]
further work for the livestream included
cutaways that will feature during
mission gameplay some of them will be
optional in the final game this included
for example the intro sequence showing
the scale of the standing which is being
dwarfed by the even more gigantic Chubin
Arkin station looming in the background
it included the reclaimer cutaway that
actually features an AI character Donna
ATAR and when she's talking to the
player in the cinematic cutaway and the
subsequent comms call on the cockpit
display she's actually sitting in her
seat in her ship as an AI this is made
possible because of our render to
texture feature for comms calls
additional cutaways were the Gainey
based exterior the turrets firing
interior based powerup cutaways slaver
scenes and of course agent Reyes rescue
early on during development during
previous for the first performance
capture shoot we had discussions about
when and where to cut the third-person
and when to stay in first-person during
our narrative of course this is the
endless story of the cinematic guys like
me trying to convince everybody else
that filmic and close-up on the
characters is the way to go to have your
scenes have impact so that characters
transport as much of the intimacy and
urgency of the drama as possible and on
the other end of the spectrum you have
game designers that hold player agency
and immersion up as the holy grail and
pretty much hate taking away control
from the player at any point in time so
during development of squadron it became
clear to us that our story and the game
experience we are aiming for is not
served well by going into either extreme
as most of our cinematics especially the
ones where the players present a
real-time we are going for an approach
that will trigger cinematic cutaways
with filmic cameras for important scenes
but the player will be able to wiggle
him or herself free of them to regain
control and watch the cinematic from a
more detached player perspective so we
will try to have our cake and eat it too
and so if both sides were possible our
conversation system already allows for
players to roam and circle strafe around
characters they are engaged with and
keeps them in a sticky filter with
special conversational field-of-view
depth of field walking speed adjusted
and other effects on this together
the ability to wriggle free out of a car
away are our tools to solving the
conundrum of cinematic impact was a
player agency last but not least in
addition to the work for the stream we
also worked on a scene where our player
is introduced to the character of old
man played by Mark Hamill during an
earlier chapter before the to go out
flying the first patrol together and
this was used for an IGN trailer a scene
like this means a lot of planning before
anything is shot as it involves a lot of
staging who is placed where and when
what would this mean for the camera axes
and how do we achieve that on set the
idea was to have old men start on the
wing then do a dramatic pause in
dialogue delivery while he shows
mechanic Yuri who's boss by nonchalantly
sliding down the maintenance ladder
leaning on the Gladius wing and then
being right in Yuri's face for the final
bit this was pitched to Chris by me we
are a previous animation done in the
engine once the staging was signed off
we started building the maintenance
leather props we would have finalized
metrics for it on set we carefully
measured the wing the thruster housing
hate differences the outer wing cannon
and went to planning the actual shoot of
the scene with the onset supervisor a
stunt like this is pretty much a no-go
for any actor to do him or herself but
at the same time we wanted the whole
scene as one fluid take so we cheated
the build-up of the Gladius wing
including everyone's eye lines and had
Marc pretend to slow it down and end up
in his final position next to yuri our
lead cinematic animator jason then took
the scene and gave old man a hand
keyframes slide down and tweak
positioning and eyelines to have the
final result so even relatively small
scenes like this sometimes mean a lot of
logistical planning to meet the
real-world requirements of a real set i
hope you enjoyed this closer look into
what the cinematic team is up to thank
you all for watching thanks honest I'm
glad we're actually at a point where we
can start showing off some of your
team's work it's really cool to see the
progress the de tech our team has been
evenly splitting their time between work
on both the PU and as 42 they're
currently extending and the FPS weapons
pipeline with a new tool this tool will
enable weapons artists to transfer skin
weights to different meshes from one
source
and object they started work on
real-time cloth and flesh sim Rd and
started development of a live link
between Maya and the game engine so that
animators can tweak animations in
particular facial animations while
enjoying the advanced shading quality of
the in-game real-time renders versus
Maya's own lower quality viewport this
tech will be particularly useful for
integrating and tweaking the pcap facial
animations in s42 cinematic cutscenes
due to the huge impact artistically
controlled lighting has on the look and
feel of an animation performance
iterating real-time and in-game will
make things much more efficient for the
team with more finite control and the
overall aesthetic the de Engine team
spent a large majority of the past month
focused on improving performance and
addressing issues for the current live
release in the process they end up
working with most all disciplines to
help profile items and make
recommendations and or fix issues when
needed some cases are straightforward
and dressed immediately well in some
cases they might actually define the fix
but find it too risky to address
immediately they made improvements to a
new memory tracking tool used for both
server and clients and implemented a
script to automatically analyze gathered
statistics to quickly find leaks and
dubious allocations our existing memory
tracking tools became too heavy for
recording and processing extended
sessions of both the server and client
so they started working on a new more
lightweight memory tracking system that
could support the most important
features in order to track memory leaks
and invalid allocations without
generating gigabytes of logs to analyze
the new system has already been used to
optimize memory usage on the server for
3.0 and attract leaks they implemented
Python scripts to analyze the resulting
log files as well as allowing to compute
difference for two of them to see how
memory allocation behavior changes over
time
in various parts of the code base which
allows us to find leaks as well as trim
excessive memory usage the team also fix
several issues related to how data is
collected in our crash data pay century
so we can see again how many different
clients are affected by a certain crash
they also fixed an issue that caused
bugs to be categorized as GPU crashes
incorrectly due to stell files being
left on the client when previously
submitting a real GPU crash one of our
newest engineers Nico started working on
an ambient occlusion solution which is
closer to ground truth meaning it's more
accurate its horizon based SSD o
previously the shader only sampled the
end of occlusion test rays across the
surface hemisphere with the rework it
now also takes samples along each ray in
order to better detect occlusion in
between to prevent under sampling we're
in the final process of optimizing the
shader as the first pass is fairly
expensive do the number of samples
required they also reworked our cloth
shader to use a more physically base
shading model it provides more
consistency with the rest of our shading
throughout the entire game in December
the system design team was busy
finalizing work on both 3.0 and squadron
42 vertical slice a lot of the work is
gone in the first major system mission
givers eckhart and ruto and making sure
there are no edge cases where either of
them gets stock curve players could
abuse them each of those two presented
different challenges as each has their
own conversation flow their own way of
being found as well as being triggered
similar to the mission givers they
completed the first implementation of
the admin officer for all of our major
locations those also had a lot of edge
cases that had to be considered and a
lot of work went into making sure that
players can't mess with them by blocking
them for too long or gave him items that
he actually doesn't know how to properly
handle some smaller issue still exists
but they have some solutions in mind
which should sorted out
fairly easy a big focus was also put
into our FPS combat AI and the current
pass is starting to show a lot of
promise they are beginning to act in
more believable manner in combat
behaviors will continue to be added and
the timing of the combat will be
adjusted all in an effort to get AI
fights to fill both challenging and fun
to play they also completed a few other
things such as doors now having override
pump upgrades hatches received credible
locks idris beds got upgraded with
shutters and more and more complex
usable Zoar getting added which should
make the game feel much more alive the
build engineers recently worked with our
austin studio during low traffic times
to prepare and run tests on our
virtualized try build cluster a non
virtualized Hardware try build test
cluster was set up to identify common
issues and differences in behavior
between the two groups of virtualized
and real Hardware focus was then shifted
to the virtualized cluster to run
standardized tests to eliminate any
variables introducing issues that would
result in loss of truly incremental
builds and identify areas that could be
optimized to increase the flow of code
related changes being validated through
try build back into the star citizen
codebase after a series of layers of
variables had been reduced through this
testing they work closely with Mike
Pickett on solutions to eradicate any
steps in the code validation process
that are destructive to the incremental
building process such as files being
touched in any reversal process that
would then require recompilation in the
next code validation unrelated to the
change being tested or not this past
month they also added a QA test request
option within try build which has
already proven beneficial for the team
they then developed a feature to offload
that test request try build two
dedicated agents in an effort to reduce
compile times with this new feature in
years now have the possibility to have
their changeless compiled against
another specified change list within the
Tri build UI the user can select an
archive option and will receive a notice
with a link to a zip archive containing
their binaries at this point a
programmer can send a request to QA
asking to thoroughly test their binaries
making sure that their fix and/or new
feature works as expected before
checking in their work
this puts yet an extra layer in place
for bug checks primarily to be used with
code changes that are deemed riskier
than others
mission testing for the QA team is
primarily done over a UK office but the
de team recently had their first real
taste of mission testing with both
Eckhart and Rudo issues were entered for
anything that was not working as
intended as well as for any issues that
would hinder accessibility to these two
mission givers the system designers
worked with QA to quickly shelf changes
for these NPCs so the QA could pull the
shelf changes down from perforce and
test to see how things were working
before the changes were checked in to a
build any issues encountered were
brought up identified and addressed and
the process would repeat until Rudo and
eckhart were at their intended level of
quality for 3.0 additional multiplayer
ad hoc testing was also completed and QA
would provide feedback on how these two
mission givers would function when more
than one player was involved the QA team
also focused on testing and regression
for the most recent 3.0 build continuing
to provide support for Frankford
development team as needed this
absorption editor continues to be part
of their everyday testing as well as the
lumberyard editor and anything related
to procedural planet tech John Lang is
our resident s42 QA tester in Frankfort
being the main point of contact for
anything s42 related out of the DE
office close to the end of the last year
the rest of the de QA team was brought
into the s42 testing loop to attend
regular
review meetings discussing the progress
of s42 this ensured that a tester was
available to provide support for the dev
team working on any specific feature at
any time which made the turnaround time
for catching issues relevant to the
features much quicker the structured
enabled QA to quickly test changes the
moment they were in a build write-up
JIRA reports for issues if needed and
send them the appropriate devs to be
fixed the whole process is a rinse and
repeat until we eventually come to a
build that is in the best possible
playable and visual state last month the
de environment art team spent a majority
of their time prepping for work needed
for 2018 it's always good to have a look
back at the progress made during the
year and realign the goals for the new
year if necessary a lot of preparation
and R&D effort has gone into updating
our planet tech and tools as we move
from moons to full planets with more
visual diverse ecosystems it became
clear we wanted to have more control and
diversity of colors and materials so
work is being done and updating the
planet tech as well as the shaders we
use on the scattered assets not only
will this allow us to have the visual
palette we want in the upcoming
locations it'll also give us a nice
visual update and boost in quality for
existing moons we also started work on

Hurston the team has been focused on
taking the level from a level design

artwork and visuals preliminary work on
