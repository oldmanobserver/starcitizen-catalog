hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm eric kieron davis
and I'm Dave haddock this week we're
going to take a look at the design and
implementation of ship scanning and
radar systems and go to jerod for some
details on the Aegis Eclipse that's
right
but first let's check in with Phil
Miller for our monthly squadron 42
project update thanks guys hello and
welcome to another squadron 42 update
the weapon system is be receiving an
overhaul and right now a lot of
attention is being put on recoil weapon
field is of course incredibly important
in any FPS experience and squadron 42
features a lot of unforeseen sequences
where this new recoil will be seen a lot
so a ton of work goes into a seemingly
small part of the overall package a lot
of everyday players may even take for
granted this started out as an animation
in Maher focusing on the bearing p8
assault rifle as a starting point for
the visual golfer animation the
variations of random surrounded to each
shot the amount the weapon kicks back
the horizontal and vertical movements of
the weapon this new system allows us to
define a base recoil for each weapon but
the player effects it depending on their
position their state under the stats as
you can see a lot more customization
goes into this than you might think
ship AI continues to come along with
recent focus being put on smoothing out
takeoffs and landings on the interest
drink some can flight formations to make
designers lives a little bit easier a
lot of progress has been made in this
last area as we termined just how AI
prioritizes targets based on threat
level chance and personal character bias
the ship AI teams also continue to
iterate on fighter and gunship behavior
with constant feedback from QA along
with a lot of back-end improvements
helping to steadily improve combat
in general also in the works is Odin
systems space scaping part of our recent
focus and s42 development has been
working on our space scene overworld
or as we call it within the project our
space scape through development on the
coil the engineers have been busy
building the amazing gas cloud tech but
it isn't just confined to the mysterious
coil it's also being used
throughout the campaign to create nebula
another pockets of interest in space you
can use this as a tool to drive the
narrative forward in particular areas
build areas in space much like a
conventional interior level controlling
color density and the style of
simulation could add a huge amount of
potential variety to the space cape from
angry aggressive simulations let the
coil to softer more serene bodies of gas
just floating in space this gives both
art and design a great math scope to
make our space scenes look amazing and
convey a message or mood to the player
from a design standpoint we enter strike
advance between plausibility reality and
cool looking visuals this tech once
perfected here in squadron 42 will also
be applied to various systems in star
citizen's PU the proper team continues
to turn our control room sets for chem
line with even more computers screens
and other monitoring gauges of filling
other pieces to really sell the abandon
vibe we have done a damage pass screen
damaged variants of each asset adding
flexibility and reused to the same
worker started on scrap house for an
upcoming location we can't go into too
many details but we are in early days on
building out the texture set and
geometry visual targets are now being
built up on chem line along with several
of the s 42 locations the full concept
our support to provide direction for the
art and design team ship emergency and
distress states are being iterated on
and polished with critically damaged
ships still in space environments now
looking suitably being up this is
separate to the fully destroyed versions
that have previously been seen crashed
on planet
work continues on the bengal carry as
well the new locations being built out
in their final states these include a
brick that although visually different
as you would expect from a different
manufacturer still echoes the
functionality of the idris because at
the end of the day a brick is a break
the animation team have been working
towards getting variations into the NPC
combat says alongside the train nursery
sets we have been developing out the
visual language for the untrained NPCs
the trained combatants will be confident
in their actions
decisive and a much more difficult
archetype to kill the untrained sets
will be more skittish and wild
interactions with this in mind we've
been paying particular focus to how the
different groups interact with the cover
objects as an example of this the Train
military sets will switch hands when
entering the left side of cover
whereas untrained NPCs will remain
right-handed this allows the train set
to be more concealed when stepping down
firing versus the more wild and
disciplined and train set there are also
stark differences in the fare extensor
said the train military will take versus
their civilian counterparts details like
these what we aim to deliver to give a
fully fleshed out variety and
believability to both friendly and enemy
assets for squadron 42 and star citizen
we're currently still in an
implementation stages we continue to
expand the AI combat behaviour as we
lock down all the technical details more
will take another animation pass to
really tighten up the visuals on all the
combat assets the character art team
occurring additional hero costumes for
our major characters such as graves
played by John rhys-davies a lot of
effort goes into the styling the best 42
scary to infer their personality and
history graves Jackie's from his old
days when he was parked hundred eighteen
squadron button-up shirt work pants and
heavy boots paying the picture of a
professional manager a security who
works on a rugged mining base under us
have even added an extra little weight
to this once trimmed Navy pilot I know
that feeling to emphasize his advancing
years so that's it for this month we'll
see you in June for another s42 update
now back to you in the studio thanks
Phil an advantage of developing squadron
42 alongside star citizen is that many
features and mechanic
can be shared which we saw with a few of
the items covered in this update that's
right and one of the features that we'll
be factoring into both games very soon
are the shipboard scanning and radar
systems yes a lot of the early focus for
these mechanics relates to the misc
prospector and mining with that feature
right around the corner in the PU but
eventually all ships will have scanning
functionality including those
highlighted in squadron 42 let's learn
more from the designers themselves in
this week's feature
today we're going to be talking about
some improvements we've made to the
radar system regarding two adjoining
systems specifically our ping system and
our scanning system right now in the
game you can see active targets that are
within what we're calling our passive
radar range so that's your normal radar
what we wanted to do though is because
the distances are so vast I want to give
you a way to get some info about things
that weren't within your passive radar
range
one way we incorporated that is by
introducing a ping mechanic so when you
do a ping it sends out a wave that is
larger than your your passive radar
radius and it returns to you the signal
values of items that are outside of that
range and within this larger ping range
and these are you'll I'm sure discovered
that whether they're friendly or not by
whether they come they turn and fire on
you or whether it's a stationary or
whether you're able to interact with
them and then as you flap to them
holding your cursor over them will
eventually give you some information
that's relevant that's important about
that ship so things like a ship owner
faction what ship type it is then we're
going to be expanding that gameplay
after this this first year of of
implication so we can do things like HBO
scan like the crew manifests how many
how many crew members are on board
what cargo do they have are they worth
commandeering yeah John take them out
take their cargo are they some kind of
are the affection based you know do I
really want to attack them and upset a
particular faction so we can make
decisions about that the cool thing is
the way that we design this whole
infrastructure is if we have a vehicle
we could provide four bits of surface
information on that it's name its health
its status and it's faction and then as
you scan further into the detailed scan
you can uncover the crew
there's our health you can uncover sub
items you can uncover car
go and you can build it in this big
manifest and then with this manifest you
could store it for later and maybe in
the future who knows maybe for
information running you could package
this information up and then sell it if
you'd like and the that idea is that you
could send out a big wave of history
energy game game logic it sends out a
big pulse and you light it you light up
like a Christmas ball so it's kind of a
dangerous thing to do it's not doing
she's radar but it's dangerous to use
the ping because you've now shown the
world where you are it's also good for
stealth gameplay since everything is
based on how much power you're using and
how much Energy's getting turned to your
we call heat or infrared if you throttle
your settings down so they're not
consuming its much power and they're not
generating as much heat your radar
signature goes down because it goes down
people aren't able to detect you at
greater distances so if you turn it all
the way down you could go under the
cover of people's radar but you're
limiting yourself you know you're
throttling all your power down your
shields might be down your weapons might
not be a powerful so if someone sends
out that ping pulse wave and detects you
they could go immediately fly over there
and start dropping all sorts of lasers
on you before you have a chance however
since he lit up like light bulb you know
hey there's someone out there I don't
know if he found me but he's searching
so it gives that interesting gameplay
where the predator is searching for the
prey and the prey doesn't know if he
should run or fight type of deal
scanning may not be the friendliest
section in the world and so as you do go
up to a ship and then you scan them you
know the entire crew should be alerted
hey you're being actively scanned so
what you do from that point can be up to
you is this an aggressive aggressive
action are they friendly you know why
the heck are they scanning me all right
if they're looking over my cargo then we
can incorporate gameplay where you get
informed of that and then
you can you can take evasive action you
can counter-attack them in the PU radar
and scanning and also use remaining
right now radar finds only minor bull
rocks we added we artificially added
some non my noble rocks in the mix just
to create a bit of element of do I find
it do I not find it but this is only for
longer distance as you get closer the
radar will be able to better understand
if it's a minor ball or not my noble and
to eliminate the ones that are not
mindful you don't have to scan it until
you get close so you already know you
have a minor bull rock when you're
pretty much in visual range and at that
point is just about finding out how good
over my nipple rock is is is there
something super valuable in there or is
it just something that you work for one
hour and get just pennies for it radar
was mainly used to find in order to find
objects in the universe whether they're
hidden thing that players have to find
or ship or a wreck or something like
this and scanning is the finding of a
finding of details of what that object
is made of what's what the components
are so you'd be a ping find out where
general generally where things are if I
have to them as you get close enough to
them so that they're in your passive
radar range and so they're now active
entities if you fly up to them close
enough in this case we have the
prospector working this way you can go
up to it you'll switch to your your
mining UI and then as you hover your
cursor your flight cursor over the the
this mining resource target over time
there'll be a little indicator that
shows you what percentage of the that
scanning abilities at and as you
progress through the scanning indicator
you know you eventually give you exactly
what the resources available in that
mining entity are so that'll give you an
idea of hey this is worth mining or you
know what this isn't exactly what I was
looking for let's go find other targets
when you get to that point do another
ping get some more general information
about where things around you and then
start heading off toward those targets I
know the mission guys are really excited
they want to start using this post 3 2
because 3 2 is mostly gonna is all gonna
focus on the mining aspect but after
that we want to start opening it up to
all the ships other than the prospector
to use it than the general scanning so
you can start scanning whatever you want
really cool stuff guys as you can see
the functionality currently being
fine-tuned for mining will have various
uses when it's applied to different
ships and situations yeah and in
squadron 42 radar is factoring into
missions and situations in fun ways
adding realism and elements of flight
simulation to the proceeding yeah and
while we're on the subject of radar a
certain ship plan for alpha 3.2 release
is particularly adept at flying under it
that's right let's go to Jared right now
for a new installment of shipshape
exploring these stealthy Aegis eclipses
greetings citizens and welcome to
another edition of shipshape we take a
look at what's on the ship pipeline
who's working on what provide interviews
with developers and continue with our
brand-new bi-weekly cadence that means
smaller but more frequent updates
I'm your host Content Manager Jared
Huckaby now on the show this week we'll
be sitting down with some of the team
members working to bring the stealthy
Aegis Eclipse to life in the upcoming
star citizen alpha 3.2 let's check in on
the progress of this torpedo delivering
Dynamo now
the inspiration for the Eclipse has been
primarily things like the b-2 stealth
bomber it's you know a flying wing it's
designed to be this like stealthy
secretive capital ship killer its role
is to kind of fly into the battle fire
some giant torpedoes hopefully try and
take down the other capital ships and
then fly away intact it's based on age
there's a lot more angles not more you
know Phillips and soft curbs look at
things like the saber Raven and tried to
kind of compliment things like the holes
in the wings so you can see the same
signal designs implemented within the
Eclipse there's just a single-seat
spaceship it's just a cockpit and
exterior and a lot of torpedo Bay the
interior the cockpits very utilitarian
it's has a lot of quite heavy technical
cladding almost when you get inside this
thing you feel like you're kind of a
small part of this like you know really
complicated bomber really climbing is
these things just almost a bit of a
challenge in itself I think when you
actually get inside the the cockpit for
the Eclipse you feel very encompassed by
it when the canopy closes around you and
the computers come towards you you feel
like you're sat in a bomber the Eclipse
has three different modes essentially
it's going to have a that there's not
code support for it yes but the
intention will be there it has obviously
an atmospheric mode where all the wings
fold back and the fins fold up and it
kind of transforms and this like really
quite agile shape and the the space mode
this is the kind of the typical
triangular shape of the b2 that you'd
normally see but also has quite
interesting landing mode as well when
the Eclipse comes into land all the
wings fold upwards and when the canopy
opens it kind of forms a shape which is
quite almost beat like if you look at
the shape of the b2 airplane it's kind
of based around like birds of prey it's
based upon a Falcon and
you know if you look at the side profile
has quite an avian feel to it so we kind
of try to kind of replicate that on the
Eclipse to a degree you know it's why
there's two to three Gladius is it's
it's a wide ship I think as why this is
this long if not wider so yeah I think
if it's flying up heads and you've got a
keen eye you'll definitely see it but I
think but by the by the time that you've
seen it it'll be too late I already like
to go
I think primarily when I was building
Eclipse I wanted to try and focus upon
that animations I wanted all of the
shifters feel very technically intricate
so from the way that the cockpit opens
and a lot of folds out to the way the
torpedo Bay so that is payload if you
look at the way the top it laid like it
delivers missiles and has this kind of
almost cylindrical a delivery system
inside it which is quite quite
complicated so little torpedoes
themselves I get lowered just below the
ship by this quite complicated
mechanical arm and once I blow the ship
dead and they have like a forward firing
motion so I know this is still probably
the biggest issues that we have with
with the Eclipse at the moment is that
this is a new kind of torpedo launcher
like in terms of animation on how it
works and this is something that wasn't
exactly how it was in the game before I
cross a generator it's basically one
torpedo on each gun sure it's like
several torpedoes like this whereas for
this one it's a torpedo launcher and
basically it can choose the torpedo so
on but it's in the middle hopefully in
the future you should be able to equip
different uh feeders and choose the
order where you're firing the torpedo
like you could get regular torpedo in
the middle like a different uh video on
the left on a different of it on the
right and say after us firing this Opie
do you want where the left also right
whereas usually it would be choppy do
one torpedo two torpedoes way so but
maybe you could say oh yeah I want top
either one first and then torpedoes
sweet but not torpedo too soon so even
if it seems like a relatively simple
ship
as a torpedo launcher is a bit more
complicated and other systems before
landing gear is quite intricate too so
when this thing moves and transforms it
feels just just very technical compared
some of the other ships but if you think
if you look at it when it's transforming
the entire thing just feels alive
so it's got this cool bells and whistles
and that the fans will see this and
think I know too cool piece of kit like
how long moves like it's you know it's
gonna feel about us
that's very minimal armaments in terms
of the baikonur it uses the entire
ship's basically just three giant
torpedoes I think it uses size nine
torpedoes so it's quite big missiles the
same the same size is what's the use on
the retaliate err so if you just look at
the size of the torpedoes compares the
ship itself they're almost as long as
the spaceship is and it's got three of
these so it's going to be and quite a
force to be reckoned with the whole
point in this thing is that it's
probably part of a convoy so when you're
flying along you'll have your escort
with you you know and the fighters
around to protect you and you have one
sole mission which is to you know fly to
your destination and just deliver the
sidelines torpedos to just wreak maximum
havoc you need your friends around you
Raley's giving you this kind of the
ample protection to make sure that for
the fighters trying trying to destroy
your ship that you have peoples in fendi
so I kind of almost welcomes a team
plate element to it because you need
this protection to be able to deliver
the missiles I think if you just flew
this the ship to a capital ship on your
own and had you know say this cap say
the address house fighters around it and
they see you you wouldn't send the
chance if you look at the exterior of
the ship it's quite dark it's all very
kind of you know matte paints this very
kind of dark color schemes but he wants
to kind of contrast this with having the
interior of the ship having this quite
bright white paint anywhere the ship
opens up really is why since I'd
obviously scoot in the cockpit because
if you're flying through space the giant
bright white cockpit then people are
going to see you coming a couple of
ballistic weapons it has a couple of
smaller
I think size 2 or size 3 guns but
primarily the big focus of the ship is
just the torpedoes the fact that it has
three size 9 torpedo
kind of speaks for itself so you you
when you buy this and you know what
you're getting into
there's there's no you know
misconceptions of what this thing is
it's a bummer straight and simple it's
going to wreak havoc destroy everything
we made sure that as he eclipse could
fit in an iOS as well so this is this is
an important one so this is something if
you have the wings deployed you won't be
able to go in a nice way so you need to
get into the learning mode which
basically will collapse society as a
wing tips we will be like this learning
gear cause there and basically you can
still fly on land in your night eyes so
this is important as well obviously
because if you get an address you can
use it as a mobile where the base go
somewhere then deploy some eclipse do
some reconnaissance work out do some
attacks obviously use you see it wise to
keep keeping me at bay
I think the flying wing design is pretty
interesting as well in terms of shape on
in terms of maneuverability it should be
a bit different since it's wholly flat
as a design in the atmosphere I won't
behave like so Savior for example
awesome some ships that are relatively
is the same size
I guess Eclipse is a stealth bomber that
will be really useful for cope software
I think especially because it can act
both as a reconnaissance ship because
it's Elsie it's relatively fast as well
for a bomba on if needed can't destroy
something but it's can also be used as a
support hole like if you have some
fighters that are already there like
trying to harass or destroy a big ship
like your stuffer or a claim where you
don't come in for your torpedoes do
massive damage and come back if you Liam
then do the same again having these
least niche roles really adds to the
gameplay I think if you had you know
heavy ship could do every type of you
know combat and can mine and
you know who could do everything build
bases then suddenly end up with a lot of
ships which basically just exactly the
same with with no head of defining
characteristics so I think it's
important to have a range of vehicles
which deliver different types of user
experiences and also things that kind of
encourage teamwork and collaboration you
know it's kind of going pollen mission
with your friends you know when
someone's in trouble or you you've seen
that there's some kind of capital ship
in the system that you need to take care
of be nothing to get your friends
together and say look guys we need to
try to take this down it's it's just a
fun thing to do
once upon a time I was falling in love
now I'm only getting torpedos shut it my
javelin there's nothing I can do it's a
total eclipse of my ship no worry about
YouTube Content ID mention that one huh
the aegis eclipse is making its way
towards release into the upcoming star
citizen alpha 3.2 as for other ships in
the pipeline we can see that the anvil
hurricane the vanduul blade and the
aegis avenger variants are all in the
flight prep phase getting ready to join
the Eclipse while the origin 600 eye is
currently in final art review but don't
worry I hear they're our designers and
engineers already getting ahead on their
flight prep work to make it scheduled
3.2 release with these five different
ships coming online at the end of June
they're pretty much the focus of most of
the ship art and tech teams at the
moment but once they make it into your
hands a brand new wave of ships will
begin making their way towards release
in subsequent patches we'll have more
about those ships in the coming months
for shipshape I'm content manager Jared
Huckaby we'll see in about two weeks
everybody thanks Jared that ship will
make a deadly addition to many fleets
out there once 3.2 hits the PU and for
those of you who would prefer an
in-your-face dogfighting to sneaky
surprises we still have a contest for
arena commander and star marine
aficionado z' you can make your own
tutorial video for either of those modes
and compete to win prizes and have your
work up on the official star citizen
website yes and then tune in to reverse
the verse live on Twitch tomorrow at
noon for our monthly subscriber townhall
episode Jared will be back with Kirk
Tomei and mark abent answering
subscriber questions following up on
today's scanning features so make sure
you get your questions in yes and make
sure you check out this week's calling
all devs if you missed it on Monday for
answers to questions about dirty ships
UI updates and more thanks of course to
all our subscribers for sponsoring the
shows and thank you to all of our
backers for making the development of
squadron 42 and star citizen a reality
until next time we'll see you around the
verse
