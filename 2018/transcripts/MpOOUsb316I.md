everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host mark abent let's get
started everyone we are here in the PU
map I know you guys like my fun fancy
dancy test level but unfortunately that
level won't do for this bug I am here in
my Gladius and we have a fun bug where
if the server and the client FPS beggar
grade too far from each other as in the
server goes too low and the client goes
too high because well we've been doing
amazing optimizations for the client
there can be a chance that when you try
to take off
you kind of sputter a bit and then you
go up so we're gonna try to see if we
could replicate that issue veiss
basically telling the server to always
run at 5 fps because i'm well a monster
so servers running at 5 FPS I'm running
at about 30 I am now going to try to
replicate that bug by turning on my
magical flight-ready
Shazam now I've controlled my ship and
I'm gonna take off and as you see I
really can't take off I am sputtering
and snapping every which way so if we
put a breakpoint in the code in this fun
little bit I'm going to put it right
here this is basically the ifcs or
flight control or basically the ship
networking system the server player is
basically the server representation as
you can see my dedicated server
representation of the the ship I also
have a client version of this and this
class basically shares information to
and from each other the server knows
what the client is trying to do in the
clients from knowing what the service
trying to do and in this situation we
have the case where the server is trying
to process some of the packets from the
client but it can't because the client
has this ticker
to 4,000 and the last received ticker
break it got is over 5,000 and so it
never processes the client state this
gets a little bit funky because what's
happening is when I first get into the
ship the server controls pretty much the
whole system and then when I do flight
ready I have told the server that I am
ready to take control of this so now I
am the local client I would like to tell
the server what I would like to do for
the ship move to left move to the right
move all the way up and down and the
client will basically be the authority
of the ship and the server could at
times be like no I don't like what
you're doing snap to this state and when
we do this weird transition period the
server is trying to snap the client
however during this odd period because
the server is at five fps it's running
updates a little bit slower than the
client so the client is way up here at
the clients the server is still catching
up so when we switch authorities the
server the client switch it basically
snaps to the service state and then that
gives the client this tick rate of 4,000
however the server last time it heard
from the client was at 5,000 so it got
into this weird situation where when we
were exchanging authorities and
capturing ticks the server gets borked
because we had snapped to the client
state but the last time it heard about
the client was when it was in control so
it gets this weird little basically
whispered the client tick will have to
eventually get to 5,000 before I'm able
to take off and this is a huge problem
because well I don't got a minutes to
wait all day and in fact if you were to
just wait inside of the the cockpit for
a good 10 minutes and then turn it on
you got to wait about 10 minutes before
you could take off not fun so what we
want to do is change this bit so that if
the server has informed us that we need
to snap
we're just going to do the snap the
server when we do that transition the
server wants to snap the client to the
correct state so that they become
aligned and their ticket rates match and
that didn't happen so we're going to
change some of the codes too and make
sure that this does happen and in this
block this is the server representation
so we need to make sure that the client
is responding to the server step so
we're gonna say client wants to serve
snap we're gonna ask the server of the
client what where is it
what tick he expected it to be should be
let's go into area when I rewind a bit
so when the server wants to snap the
client it basically sets this rule of
true indicating that we are waiting for
the client to reprocess this and it does
this weird trick with this tick rate
where it sets the current tick and then
negative one when it gets to its weird
so we're just going to make it always
send the fourth tick rate that way we
could check so it did this weird thing
where if we set to negative one we don't
want to do a snap but if we have a not
negative one we want to do a snap when
really instead it should just be the
tick rate last time we have done a snap
and if that doesn't match we just should
snap to the state that the server told
us to so we're always just going to send
the last time a server did the snap so
that the client and can know that it
needs to do a change so now that we did
this bit we need to change up we're
going to change up the client bit saying
see the server is telling us that we
need to snap to let's see server said to
snap crackle pop so let's let's do it
and what we got to do so we get the
server state and check against do our
representation of when the server told
us to last snap Wow
so if our last time we heard from the
server to snap is different than what
the server told us to snap we're gonna
snap crackle pop so if our ticket rates
are different or we're snapping we're
just going to process the snap on the
client so on the server client process
it we are just going to go yeah this is
a snap
is this a snap yes this is a snap
because our rates are different so here
since we have process to do we have
determined that we're snapping we also
need to realize that we are snapping in
this bit we're gonna always update to
the latest tick rate that the server
told us to snap to then we're gonna
process the snap as if we're gonna snap
oh snap basically teleports us to where
the server has set us all right now
let's follow the trail so client gets
the server snap snaps that be now the
server
this is the clients response saying I
have snapped at this tick if that
matches what the server expected and the
server is waiting for a a snap response
we are going to process the client and
continue down into here and go yep we're
done so service sends out the snap sends
out what tick rate is sent to snap bet
the client gets it goes oh that's
different this is a response so I need a
snap to the server state tells the
server that I have snapped the server
gets and goes yes you have and then
process it as it should
so let's recode this magic and see what
happens all right so recode is finished
we are back in our ship and let's see if
we could take off success we could take
off there's a little fun little jitter
on the UI but I'm able to get up and go
just as I please so look like we fixed
it so hope you guys enjoyed and network
shenanigans as we make the game faster
we're uncovering some fun fun problems
hope you guys enjoyed until next time so
as you guys saw we had a fun little bug
where the server and client are vastly
different fps is at times which
shouldn't happen but under certain
circumstances it does and since we
vastly improved the client FPS rating
when these two get so far out of sync
the tick rates on them goes completely
out of sync and once more heather than
the other and that caused some fun stuff
and the ifcs networking now we fix that
up so that anytime the server needs to
snap to client we just do it and then
we're good to go
hope you guys enjoyed until next time
