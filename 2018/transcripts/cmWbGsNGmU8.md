everyone welcome to bug smashers it's a
whole new year it's a whole new fun and
it's a whole lot of new optimizations so
I have here a fun little test level that
I use all the time and we are going to
show some new stuff that we're working
on and you have yet to finish but
hopefully we'll bring a lot more
optimizations as we make a bigger and
bigger world one of the things that we
have issues with now is let me just
spawn into the game anytime I spawn an
entity say a Cutlass the game takes a
while to load that Cutlass in and it
basically stalls the entire game so if
I'm in multiplayer and some guys spawns
a ship on the other side of the universe
my game will halt because I have to load
it in not fun the reason for this is
because when we load in this ship and
all of the assets and all the things
that need it it all happens in one
continuous block on the main thread so
as you're running the game we have to
spawn
stop everything load in everything spawn
the ship then we could continue on not
very efficient and physically this is
our interface we want to spawn a ship in
this particular case and it's a it's a
blocking spawn everything halts until it
is finished and then we carry on our
merry way instead we want to use this
idea that we want to spawn this entity
but let's have it in the background and
when it's ready
then we'll handle it so a lot of the
guys in the UK and in the Frankfurt
Studios have been building in this
framework that allows us to do this it's
not quite ready but it is there in a way
that we can start utilizing it so let's
get rid of this blocking spawn and
instead
we're gonna spawn a ship we gonna do my
magical ship and she's you system I
can't type for anything we're a spawn
identity with our spawn properties that
tells it where what and when and a new
thing is because this is going to be an
asynchronous call like before as soon as
we spawn it then we could access it we
can't access this right then and there
because it's not gonna spawn now it's
gonna spawn maybe a second maybe two
seconds later so we can't handle
anything immediately so we need to say
when this is spawn here's a call back or
a function call back saying this is bond
I want to handle it this way so we're
gonna use C++ this awesome new
functionality called a lambda and in
this lambda we need to have our
signature of the call back
doot-doot-doot which is the entity ID of
this thing which will be the entity ID
of our ship and the spawn friend we
don't need these here this is mostly for
other features that people use in this
particular instance we need to get the
vehicle so from this entity ID you need
to get the vehicle so now I'm gonna send
ZD we look up the entity grab the
vehicle pointer and we access this
callback from before that we used all
the way up here to initialize the
vehicle but instead of we have to
capture it so now when we do our lambda
we need to copy did you do
so these guys are basically our lambda
we capture these values we copy them in
a sense so that when our spawn entity
has finished and these get called we can
invoke the callback later that we want
so let's magic recode button see how
this magical thing works for recode
finishes I realized this won't work
immediately so this will make this
vehicle spawn correctly however it items
will still be blocking and that will be
a huge problem because now we're
spawning something on the backend but
we're doing a blocking spawn for all the
items on it so we basically won't gain
anything so we need to convert our item
port system also into this so here's
where we do our blocking spawn and it
does a bunch of crap what we want to do
is turn this into the same framework
that let's go back to game rolls haha
so here we go we need to get rid of all
little sponge because we don't know what
we need yet we're gonna spawn our entity
it's an asynchronous call we're gonna
have our call back right here send in
our spawn print send in our spawn params
Shazam so here is our spawn entities
here's our asynchronous call where we
have our entity from in here do close
this guy it's him yes all right so we're
gonna spawn this entity we're going to
and do a bunch of fun stuff when it dips
down spawning however we need to capture
some of these local variables so some of
the things we need is the item port ID
we need our entity luckily we have our
into the entity ID so we could grab that
guy he is finished spawning at this time
to get our entity it's kind of a weird
thing because it's like hey I'm gonna
spawn this guy here's a callback to
handle him at a later time
so you kind of have to write code saying
alright once he's done spawning what
would I need to do but push it into
something that I might need later and
that's what kind of this guy is it's
like hey this is gonna happen later so I
need to store off all the things I need
to do with them hence the capture
mechanic we gotta capture this
fun little variables see what else do we
have params so those are the spawn
params
haha fun friends are from in this guy
we're gonna copy those - where do we go
copy all the trams copy more params
Shazam we got everything we need so on
this guy's spawned we could access all
the fun data excellent but there's an
item port and we need to keep track of
whether or not we want to cancel this so
the vehicle spawning we just spawn it
into a fire forget this guy we may spawn
something but a part two touches before
it gets attached so we need to go know
so we need at least keep track of this
luckily there's already set something up
so spawn entity when we want to spawn it
you'll actually return this job and
access er so we go hey I want to spawn
this if something were to happen I could
say sometime in the future I want to
cancel or abort or even reset it for
example right here it's more of a safety
code it's like hey I want to spawn this
Cup 10 seconds later but in 5 seconds I
delete the whole vehicle
well that cups gonna spawn and it's
gonna try to access all this stuff and
go back so this bad boy right here will
make sure that if we ever need to do
some cleanup for example we're going to
delete this item for we cancel any
pending jobs so now that our item port
is asynchronous our vehicle's
asynchronous let's go to our recode fun
again
Shazaam recode is there now if
everything was done right
nothing should have changed so we spun
our cut list it gets processed and it's
now spawned just as before and all the
items are on there and everything
Shazaam
we have framework for any synchronous
bonding now there's still a lot of the
work to do to move a lot of stuff off
the main thread into some background
stuff but this is the foundation to get
us there
hope you guys enjoyed until next time so
as you guys saw we had a fun little
experiment there where we're trying to
build a framework for background
asynchronous spawned so we can build
something much bigger and yeah start
over so as you guys saw we're building a
nice nifty framework to process stuff in
the background so that your game doesn't
get interfered by some guy spawning a
Cutlass a few feet behind you or who
knows an interest which is a gigantic
love practically a level that you fly
around in we want to spawn and create
everything in the background so it just
pops into existence rather than stalling
you for ten seconds go moving your mouse
going or what's happening but it's gonna
take a bit to get there and part of that
is building this asynchronous framework
you know you build the framework and
then you start working a little chunks
here and there and then before you know
it we have an asynchronous fully
systemized system on background threads
well hope you guys enjoyed until next
time thank you for watching so if you
want to keep up with the latest and
greatest in star citizen and squadron 42
development please follow us on our
social media channels see you soon
you
