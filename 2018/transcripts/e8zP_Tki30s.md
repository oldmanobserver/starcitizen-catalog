[Music]
hi everybody welcome to another episode
of reverse the verse live the only show
that's done live and on Fridays man it's
I I'm not gonna tell you what kind of
morning I've had
joining us on the show this week our
members from the VFX team over at
foundry 42 UK let's go ahead and just
get right to the introductions get
started
starting from what is this my right your
my right Ben tell us who you are and
what you do for star citizen so I'm a
senior member of the graphics team at
star citizen I broke on shaders
rendering things preventing crashes
causing crashes yes in the context of
the gas cloud stuff that we did I've
sort of been leading that as I just seem
to get into doing anything to do with
volumetrics to be honest anything to do
with being that guy well I imagine as a
programmer you basically every time
every time somebody has some crazy
harebrained VFX ideas it's got to come
across your plate at some point actually
we because I I hate the effects terribly
when I dealt with particles and stuff so
we actually haven't there's another guy
that is almost he's almost in your team
now isn't he he's a he's still
technically annexing yeah Simon is yeah
yeah it's your is your man now yeah but
yeah I've been thrust back into into the
VFX team fire by gas clouds and
bodymetrix exactly that is how it tends
to work here it's just when you think
you're out of something they as this
phrase is this saying is maybe maybe I
dragged you into my
it really steep
sounds like the cart there it's like I
think therefore I am
let's just talk about the cart for the
next hour I'm gonna say yes everything
you doubted everything in the world
until he realized the only thing he
could not doubt was that he doubted bold
statement for a person who's called like
a vehicle the car it's been that kind of
morning everybody that's been Perry up
to over to his left is Mike stone Mike
Stone tell us who you are and what you
do for stars isn't yes I'm the VFX
director I started with cloud Imperium
and yeah I direct all the visual effects
including the obvious ones explosion spa
smoke steam all that kind of thing and
yeah I this guy collector right yeah
under got a you know got a quite quite a
big team actually a VFX artists and
programmers and yeah yeah it's a it's a
it's a good team is there's lots others
we get off sort of fingers in all the
pies really don't we in particularly
obviously the gas cloud stuff lots of
VFX work involved in that yeah oh good
question
I think this not 20 definitely not 20
well as well we've got two we've got two
artists in frankfurt office so we've got
Caleb and Ollie and then we've got Jake
Jake Aaron Riley you and I so yeah six
yeah six yeah eight so eight is we've
got we've got two dedicated gameplay
programmers who focused purely on the
effects as well we got Simon as Ben
mentioned he does although all the
amazing particle improvements that's
dust down to Simon and we've gotten
better QA will you a guy who tests all
my stuff and make sure it's all all safe
to to put into the game and we've got
Ben other band par not been Perry Empire
he production presentation so yeah yeah
and we talk to you guys obvious oh yeah
you're a bigger yeah that big that was
almost like I lost count I know nobody's
ever looked at at Jerrod and said that
guy's math or simple addition in that
matter but somebody somebody will have
counted that in the in the in the
audience they'll tell us how many people
that was last but certainly not least me
he'll once you tell us who you are and
what you do for star citizen yeah uh uh
yeah I'm a co VFX artist and I do
whatever Mike tells me to do now
basically just particle affects you
affects any and a little bit of code and
so shady work as well yeah yeah all the
interference stuff yeah yeah yeah so a
little bit of code but I hate graphics
programming
yeah I'm sensing a theme shows up to a
great start I mean oh you were one of
the few people who had two panels at
citizencon yet yet yet a he started your
day with it with a panel in the in the
smaller second stage and then joined
everybody else ever the larger craft in
this stage how did you end up doing two
pounds what's going on there well I told
him to yeah basically I'm doing whatever
Mike's tells me to do and he was like
okay how about two panels or four panels
okay you you almost killed me with the
start of your panel when you walked out
there and you and you looked at because
this panel is called the art digital
illusion I guess well yeah I actually
did not invent a name so I honestly
could not remember how it was cold but
you know I just thought should I should
clarify what is it actually about as our
digital illusion it kind of doesn't
sound like the inflexible so I thought
I'll just make it clear when people are
you saying you know more than our
marketing department
but the joking aside it was it was
fantastic let me help ya crazy losing
their audio today alright here we go
yeah alright yes sir I was just saying
so it was great that me have got to do
that presentation because it's not the
the particle system is something that
has improved so so much over the last
couple years it's just it's really nice
to be able to kind of share with the
backers exactly what because a lot of
that stuff goes into the game but you
know necessarily see what goes into it
yeah yeah we have another talk about
like the Coryell and such gas cloud but
I it was not a single place in which we
could show all all the new tech for the
VFX all the new content and such so we
had this idea to kind of go through all
the new stuff well actually have even
more than we shown but like yeah
within that time slot that we had we was
like 20 minutes or so we just wanted to
show as much VFX and cool stuff that we
could and was a real nice opportunity
yeah yeah you bring up a good point that
there's obviously a just one or two
panels this isn't on you couldn't talk
about everything that makes up VFX and
star citizen we put a pet we put a
threat up earlier this week where we
started collecting questions from
backers who maybe couldn't be here live
and why not
and we discovered through the course of
the question collection that a lot of
people there are enough people out there
that perhaps don't know what is VFX and
what is it BFX let's just start things
off and with with a real simple kind of
place setting question what constitutes
B effects with in star citizen like what
what is the the I'm going to look at the
game when they login at 3:35 and the PG
right now what are the things they're
looking at that are VFX versus the
things that are other art departments or
other gameplay departments okay second
so again like to state the obvious ones
you've got when the ship explodes you've
got that that what we call the death
mask you've got that that's all
particles that is that is VFX so all of
the particle system stuff that's all the
effects
man there's so many there's so many
things the effects isn't just a case of
it's not just a case of just adding
sparks to a level or that's part of it
but there's also there's implementation
of you know this gameplay implementation
as well using the effects to to kind of
give the player readability or on
gameplay inputs and things like that but
essentially if you're looking at a game
and you're thinking whether it's VFX or
not probably if it's not a character and
it's like kind of like a sprite thingy
it's it's like VFX so basically if it's
stuff rather if it's stuff but not like
geometry it's probably VFX but at the
same time behind all the VFX is some
graphics programming involved yeah like
even putting a spark on screen that's
like it starts with with someone
programming all that stuff and then we
have a tool that allows us to control
all of it and we initially have like a
list of parameters to control movement
of stuff yeah yeah and that's what we do
more or less it's also dynamic as well
as note especially in our game like the
V effects are dynamically controlled so
the thruster effects which is something
I've talked about in the past the engine
trails fallen off yeah and you know the
coil presentation that we did all of
that is dynamic the effect so it's it's
sometimes used in our game too to add
extra detail to environments as well and
give life to environment so it kind of
touches a lot of things really doesn't
it yeah but one thing that it's not it's
not lighting like I see it very often
like people think if there is a light
its VFX but it's not we have to decay
the people to - putting lights on the
level so if you're thinking like okay
there is too much light there is jobbing
that's not the effects we do like fire
we do like smoke we do sparks we also do
some kind of more systemic effects that
show gameplay like what's the boundary
of this effect example in like real-time
strategy games very often you got very
clear visuals like shockwave that ends
up this specific region that's that's
all coming from the VFX but not like
light not didn't
of general mood of the room or a space
that doesn't come from the effects but
the effects do kind of add on the top of
it although to out sort of a confusion
we do have lights you know effects but
there never is crossover it's never icky
like yes we don't cast shadows it's not
that precise and yeah you never put so
many sparks to lit up a whole room do
you think it's fair to say we're kind of
somewhere in between the art and design
teams yes
we're serving both aren't we we're kind
of we're trying to make the environments
look more alive but equally we're trying
to we're trying to sell gameplay as well
even for things like a muzzle flash on a
gun you know we help the feel of it as
well yeah the gun is not always but like
dynamics yeah you know I think I think
you hit it right there Mike it's
bringing bringing an environment to
bringing an area of space to life it's
adding adding personality to to to into
any obscene or location I think is a
great way you you you demonstrated that
really well in your in your panel where
you basically you showed us the glass
cloud with absolutely you should not not
that the test level with one with the
ladders in the box is oh yeah there's a
simple boring nondescript
you know collection of items and you
showed us how just adding VFX and VFX
alone could bring that that a that
simple scene to life and make it seem
like so much more than it actually was
and if I climb a lot to show for you a
little bit all right so we are taking so
we are taking questions in two places
guys this show if you're watching live
on twitch at twitch.tv slash star
citizen you can switch your questions in
the twitch chat we can preface your
question with the word question in
capital letters surrounded by brackets
that will help our community management
team pull it out from all the other
conversation you can also submit your
questions live in spectrum which is our
spoke communication platform available
in Roberts space industries comm same
process there to pull them in they'll
send it to us right off the bat let's go
to some of the questions that came in
from the thread throughout the week
as 3:35 went live on PTU this week we
are we are we are seeing players
experience a planet for the first time
in star system we've had moons and as
much as much as we see the moons
referred to as mine it's quite often
we're now actually we now actually have
our very first planet in star system and
a lot of the discussion especially since
they they turned our planetary rotations
on and now they can see day/night cycles
and so like that has been about the
clouds about about cloud tech is is
cloud tech something that falls within
the realm of VFX
well Terry clouds because we know the
presentation was about volumetric clouds
our volumetric clouds the same thing as
planetary clouds so most of the stuff to
do with planets is handled by a distinct
team in Frankfort so we've I know that
there's something on casting scheduled
for like he's got an idea for how to
deal with the issue that planets have
they tend to have like a cloud deck that
extends its extends a really long way
away it's sort of it curves with the
surface of the planet and that kind of
thing also I think like planetary clouds
have a very specific way that they tend
to get lit the you have to sort of skew
much more closer to reality than we had
to for the the space gas cloud I think
so he's he's cautious about just saying
yeah let's just use the gas cloud tech
because if we did that right off the bat
it would look pretty terrible they need
to be dynamic as well don't known the
bond them on the planets you want yeah I
mean there's a still room that if if
when he's developing it he decides that
he wants the nearest area like the
nearest so many kilometers to be sort of
generated from the same source that his
tech is is rendering the rest of the
clouds light suppose they they look
great in the distance but when you get
close they tend to they start to break
down or they don't solve all the
problems that you would see if you
actually have to see a ship weaving in
and out of them if something goes kind
of off-key like that
at that point I think it would make
sense that we could sort of we could
generate from his source data like sort
of create on the fly some sort of
procedurally generated gas cloud stuff
and I don't know if it feels like these
things should be able to yeah yeah I
asked the question because it's another
thing I wanted to point out that you
know when the question thread was titled
the art of space the show I renamed it
to bringing life to space you guys work
on space the effects see on the gas
cloud tag the contrails or ships is like
that because planets are all the rage
right now a lot of our questions are
assumed to be focused on planets but
that is actually not the team that
you're not the team that work on planet
side-effects
well we know we actually are
specifically about the yeah might think
there's all the all the particle effects
on planets so all the kind of dust that
you see on the kind of desert biomes and
the the pollen that you see in the air
on on the I can't think what it's called
where all the kind of forests forested
part is yeah yeah we do all the effects
in my team you know caleb actually in
frankfurt does there's a lot of the the
planetary effects I guess more watch we
get these clouds will have to do yeah
thing like clouds is an interesting one
but for me I'm really excited about
tackling the weather effects and you
can't have rain without clouds so maybe
you can but in my head you can yeah
we've got you know there's lots and lots
of scope for really cool stuff to do
with with the folks I think with the
weather you know yeah yeah we hope
you're gonna get some odd space weather
on very odd planets you know
acid rain or lightning we've got the
means to kind of create those visual
settlements oh yeah yeah well you open
the door for planet questions on that so
I'm gonna do it then will you use the
gas cloud technology develops to create
weather effects like rain and thunder or
win in the sky on planets and moons or
and if so will it be a static or a
dynamically driven environment like a
wrong question really
gas cloud tech has nothing to do with
well has but not directly it doesn't
directly kind of do weather effects you
know because the clouds well yeah the
cloud but kind of weather effects are
the effects so they don't come from the
gas cloud check and if we can drive some
of the yeah but we would yeah we can use
we can use the same systems like the
particle yeah the input crap you know
the weather parameters or whatever those
promises would be we'll use those
parameters to drive visuals for sure I
think there's a lot of similarities at
least from our side of things and maybe
not so much yeah thank you like the all
the work we're doing to all sort of
lightning strikes within the cloud as
well presumably they work from yeah and
that's the point when we make these kind
of systems we're trying to make them in
such a way that they are we're gonna get
maximum usage throughout the the game
you know it's not like this can only
work with gas clouds as long as it's got
the the input whatever they employ is we
can we can provide the output yeah yeah
yeah like in terms of using the gas
cloud for other environmental effects
like I don't know if you know if we had
dust storms or something yeah well it'll
be an interesting one in that the you'd
need you'd probably want the gas cloud
in some ways because it it's quite good
at like sort of filling a space and yeah
so that can provide but we don't really
have the ability to update every frame
so it couldn't be like boiling away yeah
but then when we go back to VFX
the outer edge of it you could make it
oil this is exactly what we're doing you
know with it that's essentially a static
thing but we've got we're using velocity
feels to kind of push those particles
along the surface and yeah you mentioned
like a dust storm I know our
conversations at the end about that and
that's something we could definitely do
you know yeah
one of the questions that came in from a
live chat says that but there was
running mention clouds that you were
working on that you were showing it
Susan time what
they'd be affected by passing objects
would like what can they swirl if you
try to fly through them I think this
comes back to that again doesn't mean
the actual core gas cloud tech couldn't
swell a first start and the voxels of
that are quite a lot bigger than a ship
I think I don't think one of them ended
up being but it's I remember that you
managed to lose a caterpillar you put a
caterpillar in the level and then you
lost it just by flying away from it
wouldn't even see it like we had a test
video before we finish the whole kind of
trailer and someone asked me I think
with you if we can have a derelict and
get somewhere you know just to kind of
sell the scale and I had like four or
five cats they are actually in the video
but you don't see them because they're
so tiny but the point is like what she's
saying that it was single voxel of the
gas cloud is way bigger than the vehicle
so if that would move you you would
essentially get like a Minecraft type of
effect
we're in like a blockage it moves and
just a very slow fire yeah but at the
same time if you put a layer of
particles there they yeah then you can
kind of virality is whirling them as the
ships fly through them are they
we do have a gas cloud contrails they
were seen in the in the video that's one
of the things like gas kilometer itself
has a bunch of data than we can use so I
don't think think we can I get like
swirls but we do have like contrails so
that there are visuals and I see
something happening with the vehicle as
we fly through the gas cloud and
possibly when we exit you will still be
in that transitioning areas yeah yeah I
would has x effect is on particles like
physics my effect I don't know some sort
of the entities or markup or something
through and it'll yeah well I I don't
want to kind of like commit to things
that we haven't done yet but I I totally
want that
we're just looking at a tech demo
someone du livre do for that goes like a
helicopter yes why use someone made it
with like vector fuel somehow like a
sail for the helicopter weight and they
push in the rack I mean I just come off
that okay stay over weekend and Monday
morning we'll be finished just this big
I've just made a new task for me how
well I wanna that's a that's a trident
to tried and true reverse the verse
happening that's a people making work
for other people to over the course of
the show it's like it I can show you in
a special folder in my Outlook let's
delete that's not that's dedicated
specific to emails that come after our
TVs like what did you come in as do what
did you say we're going to do so we'll
just add that one to the list I we talk
to Lizzie watches this sorry Simon
during the during this compound he
talked a lot about how space is actually
quite boring you know a lot lots of big
lots of lots of areas of nothing between
two points how do you go about finding
that sweet spot between realism which
would be just absolutely nothing and
this urge to just fill in every single
nook and cranny with yeah that's a
really good question I actually I think
yes some people might find it boring and
maybe we've used the word boring but
there's nothing it's it's actually in
our game it's gonna be really nice to
have the contrast so there might be I
think I might have even said this in the
presentation but there might be times
when you go into a gas cloud saying you
know in the PU one day you might go into
a gas garden there's nothing there it's
just it's it's just the the VDB as it
was and there's nothing wrong with that
you know that's just gonna be pretty
there's not gonna be any kind of event
you know like I've seen people on the
internet after seeing the gas cloud demo
we've we've shown we were talking that
maybe we want to fill every single area
with all the stuff which is not entirely
true is that what you mentioned like
yeah we're on that contrast where you
see very dense area like in real life
like for example you can have very kind
of rich
storm with wind and like the brief lying
and wind we wonder but we
also want empty places so we can kind of
enjoy these areas with all the stuff you
know any contrast with you appreciate
what you seeing well if you if you're
not if you don't have it then it's all
same so it's not good let's put pointing
out like going to your presentation
you've just filled that area with all
with the stuff that's not like we're
gonna feel like this is all of the cool
tools that we've got that's one specific
room had so many things we it just felt
right to have so many things in one kind
of engine room but you would go like the
the following corridor it's pretty empty
really hmm so need that kind of you know
yeah are you one of the images at least
one of the images you use to show when
you were showing what real space was was
from the osiris-rex asteroid cataloging
program and you use for other imagery to
say yeah this is space it's kind of
boring and whatever I heard from them
there are bathrooms there are starters
who work for the other I saw that yes I
heard from them so I'm here to defend
their honor and say that it wasn't
boring it's beautiful that's why I'm
saying I don't think it was the bear a
little bit on there quite boring there
like I would bring a book at least one
book I would bring yeah could you bring
that's not quite my candle because I
want to make a joke about losing the
screen because of interference oh I
can't find a way to make it work a hole
laughs for you a question from the live
chat can clouds have mass as in some
sort of exploded tank full of gooey
stuff in cloud shaped that can clog up
your ships intakes or something okay
King clouds become obstructions
oh yeah we've so that's not come online
yeah has it but this the flight model
too yes yes yeah I yes - we're not going
- yes - oh no no no no we don't have a
name
it's not called lousy well I put too
many to point and when you put too many
2.0 is out there it's not ifcs 2.0 okay
flight model next flight model next we
need to come up with a battery we keep
going the new flight well anyway my
friend we're gonna call it flight model
one go through it won't catch on go
through my model zero no just give up no
okay one model X yeah so we've we've had
some discussions in terms of doing the
gas cloud in squadron like do we get
drag when you fly if you fly too close
to a wall does it start to drag we've
actually been told that you get drag you
get lift like all of the atmospheric
flight stuff effectively and that's
Titan happen because there's there's
data there that says there's atmosphere
so I think there's a there's a sort of
slider to control to sort of distinguish
like how much is there for the visuals
versus how much is there physically
because they're yeah they're separate
systems yeah so so so the denser is the
more the more is going to kind of buff
you around and so yeah we should get
buffeting and yeah left and so it's
theoretically because I guess we could
make it so thick that it just chews you
up
yeah yeah somebody in the Twitter says
like so we tell Lando the BFS isn't just
closeted the whole thing at the
beginning of the show about how VFS
wasn't just clouds I can't help that you
guys are asking cloud questions I read
the questions you guys send me you guys
send me cloud questions ivory cloud
questions trying to step up to Lando
okay here's here's an on Claude question
Thank You Chet are there any plans to
use VFX for small critters such as
insects or fish like like like an
electric like an electric eel or
something I don't know
yes don't be nice yeah we I mean yeah
we've got we've got insects technically
in the game I suppose even flies yeah
and I know it's been talked about we've
we've got I don't know if it's ever been
mentioned but there's a Boyd system
which technically isn't particles but
there'll be I think they'll be some
crossover with particles on a much
smaller scale and then Boyd's for
probably probably not particles
electric eels that would be mine so
physically flyer I mean you could do it
I think that'll get geometry on the GPU
barcode system we might do more animals
kinda like I've seen us like this
example from what was it in famous
second son I think hmm they actually had
fish driven by particles and they they
did something very simple where they
passed on the position of the player to
that particle system so whenever you
were close to fish kind of fish when you
say they were kind of being pushed away
and that's not saying we get through it
but why not that's the same subject that
the same tech that makes the sparks that
fall like from the from the Hammerhead
engine room when it's damaged and hit
the geometry and it bounces off the
geometry the same tech but make the fish
particle so that they swim around yeah
yeah we go over a bunch of different
options to do different sorts of
movements and I believe we can kind of
mimic movement of fish especially
that'll be we've got coral noise which
essentially means that no line can never
cross each other which means you can
spawn a bunch of fish and they never
gonna you know go through another fish I
can't believe the talk about fish fish
has been a part of the star citizen
conversations since the very beginning
imagine like you're flying cladius and
you're hunting a fish would the nose of
you cladius like kind of impaling them
affogato well you've seen words well
they're I think it's a really good idea
all right let's talk about shadows there
specifically shadows for dynamic objects
this person says that sometimes they let
their let down by the image quality any
plans to address this or is it too big a
technical hurdle basically basically the
the shadows that are cast by dynamic
yeah so we've we've been we've had
discussions about this on and off for
years in fact so a lot of the stuff that
we've done for for static shadows on
that you know we presold we put like a
static shadow area around like your hero
location or something to to at least get
the static shadows on it
we've had some kinds of discussions
about trying to try to more easily
support more of them but then also
trying to support like live ones that
update yeah so that we can within a
certain distance maybe you'd you'd sort
of pick out where you need some dynamic
shadows and you draw them over there or
well this is one of like a dozen ways
that we've sort of talked about trying
to claw back some resolution and not
spend all the memory on the GPU on it
the reason we've not actually got onto
it is though that it doesn't unlike a
lot of the other things that we work on
it doesn't really block any of the other
content teams like that nobody's waiting
on us to make the shadows nice before
they can implement something so it's
always it's always something that we
could do we could do we could check in
and it would just be done so yeah yeah
you you you bring up a good point it's
folks who follow our development very
closely I mean the folks who who watch a
TV or watch our TV watch calling all
that and stuff you can probably get a
sense over the months since and such
about how important priorities are and
and and why and how often things shift
you know oh I thought you were doing
this next and then now we find out that
that this isn't next this other thing is
next and a lot of times that comes up
because of what you just talked about
blockers blockers you find out it's like
well we were going to move to this thing
next but to do that that work is
dependent on somebody else finishing
their work and their work is not done
yet so so things tend to get
reprioritize quite often based on
dependencies it's the things that free
up more people if you could work on this
and it allows three teams to do their
job once you're done or you can work on
this and it allows the one team to do it
or you can do this and nobody else is
affected by
it makes it a pretty easy decision
mm-hmm what you're going to be working
on next I mean the static shadows work
in theory was was down at that priority
it's just I think we reached a certain
point where people are putting things in
and it did just sort of look terrible
and so we were like okay well we can
move this up up the priorities just a
little bit we can at least get static
shadows on a target location just so
that I guess partly there is a blocker
there though that the art team needs to
see what as what their crew they're what
they create what they're creating does
it look okay in game like does it they
can't just put a load of stuff in and
say this is gonna look great when
shadows finally happen right so being
able to see something in the distance
where shadows on it see that it actually
does look good I guess that was that was
kind of a blocker for them yeah but yeah
are things like fire fires it BFX right
very much so I chat are asking if there
are different types of fires you know
like you know you always see five fires
you know red fire red flame blue flame
yellow flames like that raging small if
you how far along are you on fire attack
well there's a couple of ways we could
answer that we've got really yeah so
we've got ask this question to a
watchlist okay go ahead answer but we're
gonna we're gonna we're adding this
person to a watchlist okay so I guess do
you want to talk about the textiles so
kind of the first part of the question
is kind of what types of fire do we have
and we actually do have our internal
style guide so we do know that we we
should have like classic fire which is
all range from red and you get smoke and
such but we also got obviously other
technology such as you know John fondue
or weather and these they do eat the as
a race as as a technology that comes
from a different kind of source they use
different materials and as in real life
different materials they
do produce different types of colors and
flames for example I know you're kind of
hob in the kitchen will give you a
certain kind of slimy color and if you
burn a torch it's gonna give you like
orange stuff so we did we do have
different varieties of fire and it's not
only about the color but also about the
amount of smoke about how quickly this
mode dissipates how thick it is how much
light do we image what textures do we
use so how it looks like how many sparks
do we have if any stuff like that yeah
we kind of loosely tie that in with the
we describe it is like the efficiency of
the the thing that's burning so so a
low-tech ship would be the oily kind of
classic smoky fires me have just
described and then you might have liked
it there was a high tech equivalent it
would be well I mean this kind of sci-fi
I think I described it it's like sci-fi
blue so far yeah
far less smoke in fact no smoke much
more kind of lens flare style so yeah
we've got very very clear we know like
when we when we start to tackle a
specific thing like a specific ship we
bet we know that the manufacturer per
our internal stock IDs is a certain tech
type and that helps us define what those
what those visuals look like and even if
that's not something that's totally
obvious to be playing the game it I
think it kind of gives us a bit of a
consistent visual language throughout
the game and it kind of gives us our
initial cues about what this thing is
going to look like
I think I'm not sorry Jared I think
another pilot question I think it's
quite interesting because we we're going
to be working on hazard zones in the
future and that is we're going to be
we're going to be looking at the
behavior of fire in the game as well so
the room system itself if there's oxygen
then it should burn more the the fire
itself could contributor to removing
oxygen from that room propagating fire
I'm not saying that like we'll be able
to just set fire to the low in the world
because that'd be able to stretch too
far but we've got a lot of plans in
terms of the functionality of the fire
as well yeah what about fire in
different environments like
like 0g there's the size and shape of a
fire change with on on planets or moons
with lesser gravity or up in space a
ship that has no gravity whatsoever well
all our particles are built to work
we've got like we've basically got
gravity is not something that really
defines the kind of shape of fire if you
look up the physical properties of a
fire itself like probably there's not oh
yeah it doesn't disagree with you on the
sure what I mean is there's more to it
there's like pressure there's the source
and stuff like that yeah I think I think
it's having a bit with what you're
asking before Jared about the balance
between completely realistic and and
pure Hollywood I know that there'll be
people saying well why did he got a
fireball in space because it's not
technically possible we we straddle the
line between Hollywood and real life
[Music]
deliciously
yeah from fire to water is there any do
you guys touch Hurston added oceans
added water to the game is there any any
bit of that that the VFX team touches
splashes sometimes we have we haven't
yet I mean people people who you've kind
of experienced the water in the game on
though that there's no kind of impact
effects yet but and that's primarily
because again the planet team have kind
of worked on that that core course heck
and yeah for sure we're going to be
leading to our impacts to that probably
maybe even a fish fish yes a good idea
well splashing figure see how with the
fish they go right back to the gas
clouds is there been any talk about gas
clouds that can damage our ships Wow
effects that gas cars can have two ships
on your demonstration but yeah I mean
that's that is them really isn't it -
we've got a whole bunch of houses
we want to put in there I think I think
we've sort of skewed away from the gas
cloud itself damaging the ship like yeah
gas cloud it's watch inside the dust
cloud that kills you
yeah although we don't have that thing
from cellto in there as far as I know we
don't know what the thing from the the
solar movie big eye I mean I've not
checked everywhere around it but we I've
never seen it when you guys do show off
the planetary cloud tech that's to think
on one common thread that has come up
over and over and over again has been
about crusader and and what it means for
something for it entire like gas cloud
planet like crusader what are some of
the attempted want art related
challenges that that you guys can
foresee because I know we're we just
showed that we're working on our Corp on
on a TV we're also doing some work on
micro tech right now when it comes time
to work on crusader is the gas cloud
tech something that can apply to
crusader or are we starting with from
something wholly new or at scratch you
go on this one i think we have we've had
discussions about this we'd really don't
want to start an entirely new piece of
tech just to do crusader obviously i
think that the basic plan for it was
literally take take everything that
we're doing and throw them all at
crusader like I think these are these
were sort of very rough plans as far as
I remember them but it was sort of like
if we're doing separate like planetary
clouds and gas clouds then we could have
a layer of Lannister clouds we could
have a layer of gas cloud we could have
like a sort of palm texture like the the
deeper areas maybe that you wouldn't get
into we could have a couple of layers of
palm textures just sort of moving around
to give you give you the sense of all
the extra layers you could get the gas
cloud layer you could embed the floating
platforms and the cities and everything
into I guess I think that there would be
a lot of X
things to solve along the way using gas
clouds in atmosphere I think would be an
issue at the moment the assorting thing
it's not just the sorting thing but
people who've done quite nice cloud
demos they have some sort of solution
for light coming from outside you know
like right the skybox needs to shine
through the clouds
rich lighting which we don't have to
deal with in space as much but yeah it's
pretty pretty much just layer up
everything that we've got and sort of
see where the edge cases are oh well
what's still missing and then put VFX
over them like oh if you if you if you
don't know Crusader Google starts to
dissing Crusader Crusader is the plan
it's you know everybody's got their
favorite planet favorite system whatever
crusaders been the one that this line
that has been looking forward to for a
long long time it's Cloud City maybe I
mean it scares the hell out of me it'll
be cool it's it's I if you said it
scares the hell of me but honestly in my
experience with star system which has
been almost five years now the things
that scare us tend to be the most
impressive it's I think I I think when
we when we come at something that's like
you see a problem you see a challenge
like oh yeah we know how to do that it's
like alright you know it's done and it's
good it's whatever it's when something
scares us when something goes oh how the
hell are we gonna do that that's when
all the the best creative comes together
and I'm always consistently amazed when
honestly obviously the cast clouds
similar kind of thing in the original it
was like wow this is this is technically
I could a challenge more for you it was
an interesting first task to be given a
song that you first time would take me
on a bit of a tour so I could get used
to the different engine systems and Ali
said he's some concept art for a
gas-fired classical yeah just do raw
metric clothes that no one has ever done
before I should be fine with attempts
that we tried and failed
don't do those how about during that
during your presentation we showed
lightning in the gas clouds his
lightning is lightning going to do
something there's lightning something
that will cast shadows yeah actually we
did have shadows for lightning lights
but I think there was a buck and they
didn't work the rink last minute but
didn't record it the player did I mean
the lights are there sort of there at
the weather lightning comes from and
where it hits like we don't have every
individual zigzag of it emitting light
individually binos yeah you don't even
need to have it because we can increase
the radius of the sides so in between
you still get some shininess and how do
you do really care from visual point of
view is kind of it's so fast first of
all you don't even see that there is
light missing in between
second of all see kind of impact and
kind of destruction happening after so
two lights are good enough we've had a
number of questions all related to a
planetary weather effects what can you
tell us about your involvement planetary
weather effects and where we're going
it's gonna sound like the same answer
really as what's but with the the planet
team like those guys these things that
they're working on the once there's a
couple of things that are going to come
in they're going to get done and
finished that will then kind of open the
floodgates for us to do our thing if
that makes sense we've got tons and tons
of cool ideas for weather and it's one
of the things that actually really
excited me about pilots in the first
place when I first kind of sort of sort
of the guys in Frankfurt I was like oh
wow yeah we could we could do tornadoes
and dust storms and rain showers and all
that kind of thing so we we totally got
plans to do all that we're just waiting
on a few key things first before we can
really really go for it yeah I want to I
need
rain on a train over Louisville to
really sell get me to that Blade Runner
yeah so the thing about that is because
it's not purely a particles thing
because we could make a rain effect
easily we need to we need to have rain
affecting how the shade is look you know
on the visor and canopy and things like
that so it's not something that the VFX
team alone are going to be resolved in
Italy the graphics though is the complex
system really Mike yeah getting to
wetness you having like puddles and such
getting I don't know maybe even changes
to the flight model during rain or
storms and possibly if the storms
happening next water kind of fish flying
out of it
I mean not amazed at that like you can
do particle rain close-up but there's
got to be some point where like if you
if you're looking at a rainstorm coming
in on the horizon you can always see
that there's rain you can see like this
volumetric there was flag of rain and
that that eventually turns into actual
rain so that so we'd need something to
do that that excites me actually being
up in space and seeing the rainstorm
below you like you go in towards that
planet that that's what excites me
seeing that that storm happening when
you're you're safe in space from it but
that doesn't mean that it has to be
seamless when we do it well it doesn't
okay it's like it's real you know it's
like oh that's a storm in the distance
but now I'm flown and I'm in the storm
so lots of stuff to biking if I can
start in orbit and I can come down
through the rain clouds and come down to
Louisville and come down to a single
person standing on top of a building
doing the Roy batty monologue over face
over IP in the rain
that will be like I'm done at that point
that's all I need for the star citizen
you give me the accident you land the
ship on them and accidentally
accidentally let's go from let's go from
the planets up to the there's the stars
will we see something like coronal mass
ejections or solar flares and if
so any ideas about how they'll affect
gameplay even capable of getting that
close to a star well it's definitely on
the list of things to do to make the
effect that close I mean like I think
this is this as well yeah going going
close to a star is a is a huge technical
task but sort of doesn't give you a lot
of gameplay but I know it's sort of on
everyone's it tends to be on people's
lists if you regardless of sensor just
the Sun the point if you'd the effects
themselves yeah it's on it's on are
definitely on our backlog and I've
chaired briefly it's hot regarding
gameplay permutations for that but I'm
not gonna speak for Todd I'm not gonna
speak for design on what the gameplay
implications are but I think you're
right like logically you'd think well
the game plan vacations are if you go
towards it you get so close you die so
yeah graphics wise the only issue is
that well there are many issues but one
of the significant issues is that we
tend to treat the Sun as like as like a
small ball in the distance that there
are various equations that kind of
fairly reasonably approximate what
that's going to do to the lighting when
you start sort of flying right up to it
for a start you have to dim it down
because like there are sort of them
would you call it the exposure
adaptation on the camera isn't able to
do the brightness of landing on the Sun
so you end up having to sort of dim it
down to what photos of the Sun tend to
look like yeah but then also you're now
landing on the surface of this ball so
some of those equations take some
shortcuts that don't really handle like
something bigger than the earth that
you're touching so yeah I was here we
can do all that the effects but
technically the Sun is so bright you
should not be able to see anything
happening on the surface so is it worth
it I mean yeah depends on what do we
want to hear also if you're lazy you're
missing this you leave it so bright that
nobody can see and then you just tell
them it's all there I know I know I've
done all over others there's coronal
ejections
Sun flares and there's there there's a
billion particles going on you just
can't see it because it's so bright
sorry guys you know that's realism you
wanted to realism fire propagation
system to distribute the fire on the
surface of Sun yeah I think I think I
have a write-in answer from Ali on that
one that says yes we are doing those
effects yes that's basically what I said
at the start we're almost out of time we
only got time for a couple more
questions good job guys
mirrors this person says will I ever be
able to see myself in the mirror
standing in front of an empty mirror
freaks me out this is not this is sent
by an Anne Rice yes so mirrors are
definitely something we've wanted I
think we need them for squadron for a
couple of scenes so they're definitely
on our roadmap the caveat on that is
that they are they're only able to
really be used in some sort of
controlled environments they do trigger
a lot of extra rendering work so if you
if you're in the middle of Louisville
and you're looking at a you're looking
at an advert somewhere and then we just
replaced that advert with a mirror
you've kind of just probably half the
frame rate so your bathrooms is that
they tend to be small so we can we can
set up the mirrors in places where we
can already afford the frame rate to
include the mirror basically yes and
then if you don't think if one of them
is small enough to be grabbed and
moveable like people won't grab mirrors
put them in front of mirrors and then
yeah the things that people do in an MMO
environment with mirrors will see no end
so let's see is it possible to use more
but we're back to the cloud questions is
it possible to use pre simulated
velocity fields to create swirling gas
clouds that we can fly through or is
this scenario limited by something like
the signed distance fields that's
actually something I asked you not that
long time ago what was the answer me
yeah the the exact technical reasons for
that being difficult it's to do with how
to put it because we did a test that had
a similar for different reasons we were
trying to break up her sort of like
pixel edge detail so when we were a
marching obviously we just we have this
big texture and we're reading through it
making tons and tons of samples if you
introduce something where you have to
read one thing to offset where you're
going to read another thing it
introduces a small delay on the GPU and
if you do hundreds and hundreds of
samples and each one of them has a
separate offset that has to be
calculated from another texture I think
it I think it's it's something
ridiculous like it multiplied the the
time it took to draw by about five so in
theory you could have a sort of assigned
distance not a scientist availed a
vector field that sort of each frame we
sort of moved along kind of like the the
vector field stuff we doing particles
it's just probably it's not going to be
feasible also things like the shadows
that we pre calculate for those wouldn't
update so yeah it's more likely that we
do something static and then we put
particles on the outside yeah maybe
those particles held ourselves visual
might might actually look like what what
the what you expect it to look like
we're just using that was fun you don't
have a bad joke to tell not this time I
forgot to find a collection of dad jokes
say didn't didn't you didn't you come
with a bad joke I didn't I can repeat
joke do you remember the joke I was like
yeah I do I don't remember the joke
can't move the joke God give me two
seconds I thought my eyes closed it was
quite bad so have you have you heard an
explosion in the cheese factory last
night
no because there was a lot of debris now
I know I didn't remember that one yeah
just burned a hole in your memories the
self-preservation instinct two years
from now and that's how the same joke
again two years from now when we have to
back
all right guys been Mike Mike meow thank
you so much for taking your time to be
here on the show that's this week it's
these shows where we get to highlight
departments that don't always get their
time in the Sun are some of my favorite
it's it's a-you know me it's I always
like to do but the things that no other
video game developer would do it just
what's about the BFS guy is on a Q&A for
an hour live modernist what that means
could it do I appreciate it's not
everybody's cup of tea but I really like
being able to highlight the work that
that everybody on this product does as
much as I can so thank you so much for
taking the time out of your day to be
here with us thank you very much thank
you Vince look it's a pleasure
um yeah that's it remember if you didn't
see a TV yesterday you should check that
out there will be no around the verse or
reverse the verse next week because we
have our Thanksgiving holiday here in
the United States we will instead have
some unique anniversary special content
for you to view starting next Friday so
you'll see that instead of our TV and
then I will be back the week after that
and who knows we will have now maybe we
can do a show with human resources or
something that's the last white whale
that's the last Department I've never
gotten just as powerful we're talking
with human resources about how to fill
it
what about office managing like person
pine milk and stuff hey those other
planters hold the studio together oh no
actually no actually you may be on our
TV but maybe I can now I'm going to call
an office manager on a calling all Deb's
because they do they do deserve they do
deserve their time you sign off using
today soon yeah yeah except I was
manager has absolutely refused to ever
be on camera so that could be hard maybe
we'll do it with a she
/ like well this unknown person people
you're doing testimonials with a voice
transmogrifier alright guys that's it
that's Ben that's Mike that's me how I'm
Jarrod
we'll see not next week but sometime
after that take care guys see it
