## Transcript

greetings citizens and welcome to
another edition of reverse the verse
life I'm your host Content Manager for
global video production Jared Huckaby
on today's show we'll be sitting down
with lead network programmer Clive
Johnson and lead gameplay programmer Rob
Johnson no relation to discuss
performance and optimization and answer
your questions live following
yesterday's performance and optimization
focused around the verse but before we
get to that let's do the Week in Review
last Friday we had studio director eric
kieron davis and senior producer dennis
crow here to discuss production
practices and their work on the RSI
public roadmap for 2018 it was a fun
talk and a good chance to get to know a
part of development that's often
overlooked and misunderstood Monday
brought with it another all new episode
of our weekly Q&A show
calling all devs which featured answers
to your questions about buying weapons
without the UEC automating ship turrets
the cargo space in the freelancer der
underground caves and the status of the
star said it's a mobile app stretch goal
yeah me now if you haven't seen calling
all devs it's available every Monday up
on YouTube Tuesday brought with it the
March episode of Laura makers guide to
the galaxy this time focused on the
caifa system spiritual center of the
xi'an empire and a popular tourist
destination to many in the UAE and when
we talk about shows that only star
citizen's star citizen would do and only
star citizens would watch laura makers
guide is a fantastic example of this
each and every month on wednesday we
hosted our very first subscriber only
tour of the los angeles studio where
subscribers not only got to see some of
the stuff we're working on ahead of time
but participate in the filming of this
week's around the verse it was a fun
afternoon and a great opportunity to
hang out with just a small fraction of
the thousands of people that make all
our community content possible now keep
your eyes and ears open in the coming
months for word on joining our next
subscriber to work just like this one
finally on Thursday
this week's around the verse was a
twofer we had a star citizen project
update with some really cool looking
look at the future of cockpit displays
and the main feature read about the
continuing work tuning performance and
optimization for star citizen now when
we come back we'll be joined by the
Johnston's Clive and Rob to dive even
deeper into this topic central to the
hearts and minds of star citizens
everywhere
stay tuned alright well on the show this
week Clive and Rob Johnson FMV 42 UK hey
guys doing pretty good Jared how are you
I'm okay a little under the weather
would not be a subscriber to our on on
Wednesday and one of them brought plague
but I'm okay tell me when somebody's
like your date your date quills in the
shot and I'm like okay I'll move it hide
it over here and I'm like maybe if I
leave in the shot I'll get a free
sponsorship but so performance and
optimization
obviously this is this is a topic that's
very close to backers hearts we star
citizen is in a unique position because
we are running a live game environment
in the middle of our development you
know but there are lots of terms in the
in the in the gaming community early
access stuff like that we're we're sort
of like that we're not we're not we're
not quite like like a pub genie and
whatnot where we are we are very very
very early on I mean we started our live
environment back when we had only the
arena commander module we are we are we
are building this game out live in front
of our community and that brings a lot
of challenges with it one of the things
I think it was I think it was a I can't
remember I can't remember who said no
but usually optimization happens towards
the end of the process and we are
because we're running the cyber
environment because we want people to be
able to accurately test the stuff that
we have to we have to sort of change the
paradigm a bit and and optimize our
performance live during development and
that's what our h-e-b was focused on
last yesterday if you haven't seen it
that's a Bilbo up on YouTube and at the
end of this show I highly recommend you
to go and check it out but on the show
today we've got Robin Clive Johnson no
relation and I'm going to keep hammering
that dire joke because I love it I'm
sorry guys let's just take a few moments
now and introduce
you introduce yourselves to everybody
who's watching I tell who you are and
what you do for starters isn't
I'm Rob Johnson leaked gameplay
programmer here at foundry 42 Wilms oh
I'm Clive Johnson lead Network
programmer also Yankee 42 no relation no
relation so what does a lead programmer
do run also it's really and it primarily
I'm in charge of managing a team of
gameplay engineers and also work with
production and scheduling the work that
the team has to do and do a lot of bug
fixing and trying to look at critical
issues as they come down and things that
might be stopping us pushing T vacati
for example they often get put on elite
plates first for us to assess and then
assign out as needed and just generally
you know a day in the office is just a
busy mix of emails Skype JIRA's
bug-fixing occasionally a little bit
future work maybe they maybe a few
meetings so it's really just a little
bit of everything but really good fun
you're really selling their glamorous
video game developed on there Robbie
yeah when is the lead network engineer
you pretty much the same thing and the
the kind of fame the other part of it is
the the dealing with demons are wrong
Wed talking to the other leads and
coming up with solutions for the kind of
problems that we face it's going to work
for everybody and trying to make sure
that everything's tossed off in their
engineer and production aware of what we
need and when we need it by so that we
can worry about dependencies now if
there's your first time watching our TV
we are live congratulations hello for
those those so those of you who are here
live if you're watching on YouTube after
the fact thanks for watching
we do take questions live in two places
you can submit your questions either
twitch chat where we're broadcasting on
twitch.tv slash star citizen you can
preface your question with the word
question in capital letters surrounded
by brackets that helps us pull it out
you can also submit questions live on
spectrum which is our own communication
platform available on Roberts space
industries comm in addition to the live
chat we also put up a thread last night
once HG beam went live collecting
questions for folks that couldn't be
here live the other thing that there
that does is it lets people vote on
which questions they want to see
answered so we do have some questions
from that chat from that thread that
we're gonna get to while folks in the
Live Chat are coming up with what they
want to ask the first question from that
thread for you is the time and effort
required to come up with temporary
solutions that allow us backers to play
each patch at this early stage
interfering with the development of
long-term solutions the game needs I'm a
pretty good question I think for me
interference may be a bit of a strong
word there and I'd say a lot of them a
lot of game development you've got kind
of times at which you know you've got so
you might need a short-term solution
medium term solution long term solution
obviously with a game like this we're
always aiming to try and get the best
long-term solutions in which was doing
things properly we're not a game where
we can really take shortcuts we'd we
have to we have to look at you know what
he's going to work beyond the next patch
with us releasing and every few months
and to get a build release ready we are
at times going to you know have to look
at addressing issues in certain ways
that may not be relevant in a year or
twos time so for me it's kind of just
part and parcel of what we do you know
we've you know it's not new to us as as
engineers and even if we weren't doing
the patches every few months and
releasing them to the public you know we
still need sort of short-term solutions
at times to for example and allow design
and other departments to
actually like get on with their work you
know you don't you don't just start with
very close to finished product in a
cycle of game development there's a lot
of prototype in and try and stuff out
and and sort of changing things around a
little bit until you come up with a good
mix of things that actually works well
so we're yeah it's for me it's just part
of their of what we have to do yeah I
think that affects just about every
aspect of star citizen's development not
just performance optimization we are
always building the first iteration of
something and then you know wrapping it
up in a form that can actually go out to
people and then building the next
iteration of building the next iteration
like with like with 3.1 we're putting
out the first version of our character
customizer it is not the it is not the
fully featured version that we that we
want with the DNA morphing anything but
it is it is it is part and parcel of how
we've chosen to develop star citizen
which is live and out in front of
everybody you're constantly you're
working towards a long-term goal but
you're also working towards these
short-term goals and having to package
everything up in a and there's nice of
bow as you can to give to people every
couple months my next question for the
thread what's the difference between SV
calling in 3.1 and network buying
calling it's become a serialized
variable called yes
okay so bond column will be the entities
that are far away from you they're not
present on clients at all and so they
won't be taking any memory they won't be
taking any CPU load serialize variable
client on the other hand is that we just
stopped sending the network updates for
those entities those entities that are
far away so far away on your client that
you can't actually see them and so
they're still the entities are still
there that's all present in memory and
they don't require any CPU updates
because they're not getting Network
updates so the natural state of entities
on the client or most entities on the
client will be if they're not getting
any network updates on the server
they'll go to sleep
for the next network up they decide what
they need to do so I hope that explains
the difference all right from the live
chat
how long have some performance increases
or how long have some performance
increasing features fixes been in
development all do we start optimizing
with 3.0 or have we been working on
these things for longer than just 3.0
branch I'm the first time we started
discussing network optimization that was
the day I joined the company about 3
years ago and we've kind of we've been
working on it steadily ever since trying
to unravel the pieces bit by bit so that
we can we can make these changes we get
in there and we yeah luckily there's a
lot of there's a lot of them a lot of
the work involved
say for example in clive putting in the
new network
backend and then game co take it taking
5s api and using that in the game code
to replace some of the older stuff that
we originally took when we got the
engine so a lot of the time it's it can
just take sort of several months
sometimes to convert over what may be
like literally sort of hundreds of
pieces of code that we've got to make
sure that they still work and and make
sure that they then use the new code and
which can then be more optimal because
then because Christ done such a good job
on it and I got a question pretty well
this is from me it's not from the check
backers have have taken to referring to
all performance based issues as netcode
issues how crazy does that drive you
absolutely livid twice not no hair yes
yeah long hair when I joined a company
yeah he's got pictures to prove it as
well I think you can we help
what can we say to help dispel that
Judge Esther I mean obviously we all
know that there are performance issues
we see the same frame rate that our
backers see when they play in whatever
what can we say now to kind of educate
folks that this isn't that what you're
seeing is not just a blanket net code
issue
okay so saying that there's performance
issues in multiplayer is is fine hmm to
then pin it on a particular part of code
and say well because it doesn't happen
in single-player all the code that you
can see well-known in single player must
be fine there is a bit of a leap because
basically there's sheer different
quantities of entities that were dealing
with between single-player and
multiplayer mm-hmm so you'll have I'm
not entirely sure how many entities
we've got purple I would say 220 odd
entities per player for each client that
joins and then they'll spawn a ship that
could be somewhere between a hundred to
I think some of them will get them so
like five thousand entities and then
they'll go and fill those with cargo
which more entities and they'll fly off
and they'll interact with pirates and
TAS givers which are more entities that
get spawned and they'll be debris police
is fine off so yeah that the number of
entities grows very rapidly with the
number of clients and that's what causes
the performance low so if people want to
call that net code then that's fine but
it's not the networking specifically
it's the networking and the game code
and the physics it's really just there
every every module and every engineering
department really kind of has to take
responsibility for their own perfect
performance and that they achieve
in-game I mean you know when when we've
been profiling this stuff and you tend
to you tend to find that sort of almost
no engineering department can can ignore
performance you know we get the UI guys
the AI guys as well the audio guys
there's you know it really is
sort of shared across the board and it
might be that it might be that say you I
do really great optimization and then
all of a sudden the next biggest hitter
on the list is the audio guys and then
it you know then it might be the
graphics guys it's just you know and
from time to time unfortunately so
things in unexpectedly crop up and you
know all of a sudden we have to jump on
those fix that and then get back to
bring in there and bringing the average
frame time down and improving things I
think as weld has kind of been a bit
miscommunication in for a while we were
method that the bottleneck on the server
was the networking code and I think
that's kind of been misunderstood a
little bit that it was the bottleneck
everywhere so yeah maybe that's partly
responsible yeah that's one of the
reasons why you know we had talked about
we had we had wanted to have you on
happy hour at the end of this year and
whatnot but as we dealt as I dug deeper
into it you know everything that was
going on we realized that this is far
more than just you know net code
networking something that we wanted to
do a much more robust feature and that's
what that's what folks are hopefully
seen on a TV yesterday that performance
and optimization is is a task that
affects almost every discipline in star
citizen so it will it will be all teams
working in conjunction to bring star
citizen to the 60 frame heaven that
we're all aspiring yeah I mean the other
thing throughout as well of course it's
not just engineers you know if a
designer wants to drop two billion
entities in life all that performance
isn't gonna be great you know if an
artist wants to model an apple out of
like a trillion Polly's place it on the
table and an outpost then again you know
this there's this you know a shared
company responsibility really who know
I'm trying to remember trying to
remember who that was right now but
somebody wants so many once told me that
the original freelancer model the one
that had all those crazy rivets because
the rivets were were created incredibly
poor
to be honest that the the freelancer had
a larger memory footprint than the Idris
they went and and and that's definitely
not network relay that's just that's
just that that's just the franceour is
one of the reasons we we go back and we
revisit these ships and not just because
we want to change them for gameplay
purposes but sometimes we just need to
seriously optimize the way they were
built we've gotten much better at
building these ships as time has gone by
so yeah alright next question from the
spectrum thread what network enhanced
ins beyond what is listed for three
point four are needed before we can have
two systems connected by a jump point
so beyond three point four so three
point four we've got on the on the
roadmap server migration so for two
systems they're always going to work all
the planners for them to work like
separate instances so the servers for
one system and the servers run over the
system will be completely disjoint and
won't communicate at all
with thinking maybe it's not decided yet
that we could use the server migration
technology to help provide a seamless
transition via the jump points from
system to system
mmm so potentially what we could do is
someone wants to jump from one system to
another their ship gets put into a
server and its own little bubble and
that's ever then breaks off from the the
mesh in one system and then is moved
over to a mesh in the other system plan
is connected it and one of the
difficulties that we'll have to try and
solve if we do that is the reason we
won't mix systems together won't connect
service from different systems together
is that each system has its own
coordinate system and with the star
being at the center zero zero zero and
so we have to move from wherever you
jumped from the something system to mmm
whichever destination system you're
going to move the ship move that server
ball across space
who without colliding with anything else
and there's you know over the systems so
I'm yeah it's it's a little tricky but
yeah we're thinking about it we have to
build a server migration techfoot server
meshing tech first and then we'll see if
we can utilize it that way it's still a
the question was still a bit far out
there yeah that's right my son I am
another question from a live chat
what upcoming optimization are you
personally most looking forward to and
why and for me I think one of the
biggest things this year for us is
subject contain a stream in I mean is
that's that's something we're working
towards and Earth 33.3 it kind of goes
hand in hand really with like some of
although we're a new entity component
work that we've been doing so the entity
component update scheduler and really
the with object container stream in you
know you should get optimizations on
load times for example because you'll be
coming into the P you only needing to
load in the immediate area around you to
begin with so from our point of view and
as Davis we're very much looking forward
to being able to get in the PU fix some
bugs in I get an absolute fraction of
the time it takes us to load into the PU
right now so you know it's not just
going to be a benefit for you guys
playing the game it's going to be
something that you know that is great
for us every day and work wise but to do
that there's you know there's there's a
lot of there's a lot of talented guys
and the engine side of working it back
and forth at but also sorry game code
wise we again have to go through lots of
old game objects convert over that code
to our new entity components
we have to make make the various classes
thread-safe
avoid it so to avoid crashes it's so
that those those new classes then
shouldn't should in theory be ready to
put on everything should be ready to go
on the battery up data spread the load
across multiple cores allow the game to
scale a lot better so really it's kind
of hard to pin down one specific
optimization when we have kind of
several or all being worked towards at
the same time you know we have things
back to update in now we have a lot of
these classes that are now fred safe we
have a lot of stuff that's being
converted over this just there's just a
couple more releases probably until
there until we're quite there so we're
yeah that that's that stuff you know
this you know I saw it something I'm
very much looking forward to and because
you know a lot my job for the last like
three or four years has been getting rid
of a load of old code and putting in
this nice new shiny stuff so we we dream
of the day where we just have this nice
shiny code base that's that's our own
and we're not we're not fixing crashes
and something that got added years ago
and yeah you know we can just we can
just enjoy and enjoy the new code but
hope you want to get to it's kind of
like being asked to make a favorite
child my parents had no trouble with
that right while you were talking
Rob one of the questions came in that
says can we please dummy explain that's
their words we please dummy explain what
object container streaming really is
okay well an object container in its
simplest form you could maybe just think
of it as actually kind of like a level
yeah without sort of without a few bits
of stuff that's kind of specific to it
that's really being a level if you like
you know
like an a because I let most of what a
level is is it's just a list of objects
so in the CryEngine and your most
lumberyard you're looking mostly here
and entities and brushes mm yeah okay
large-scale pieces yeah like ships and
space station yeah planets they're all
object containers so that's like a net
so like the data is like an XML like
file format which just is sort of
containing a list of things and then
that is so if that's an object container
the idea is you sort of load into the
map low load one set of objects that
surround you you spawn a ship at the
ship itself can be an object container
it's just a set of objects popping that
ship fly it fly across the galaxy you no
longer need the object container that
you've spawned in in in the first place
a port olisar
so you can remove those entities so
really when we say right object
containers it is kind of just that it's
a container with some objects in and the
way we've got the game set up we can we
can spawn those in dynamically remove
and dynamically and that's that's really
where you know that's really this sort
of streaming process but as simply as
akin there as I can get just so it's
like when you load in there port olisar
it doesn't have to send you it doesn't
have to load up the star further that's
sitting on Levski and the surface of
Levski in your memory is you can't see
it you can interact with it right now
there's no reason for it to send that
data to you and for you to load into
your memory you know it basically it's
it's a start affair or reclaimer an
entire base they're all various object
containers at different sizes and scopes
and this is just the system that
determines all right we do need to send
this to you we don't need to send this
to you and
when and where that happens okay from
the thread there are massive fleet
battles still feasible yes yes anything
so yeah that was easy
[Music]
do you have any elaboration I was just
joking about that um yeah okay um
one of the things you've got a bear in
mind is get the 3 point out the servers
were running on 16 cores so the thread
runs one flat-pack or so we had 16
threads available to the so um there's
servers that am I wasn't enough
available to us um have up to 72 calls
so obviously there's a lot more cause
there's a lot more scope as to expand
and run more things in parallel with the
parallel and the changes that we made
and make the network code one more
Impala it's it stands a look yeah we
could pretty much scale the numbers
quite well um it's it's the lies a lot
not just on the network code though it
relies on as bob was saying earlier it's
the mix of every one of the physics code
and the gameplay code you know
everything working together so that we
can fill out those cause as optimally as
possible and I do believe that we've got
the systems coming online and don't
allow us to do that such as the entity I
always get it stuck on this name the
entity component update schedule we do
have the best names in engineering they
are catchy
um so it's just a question of leveraging
those to the best of our ability and
then yes I think massive space battles
or what will be a reality
yeah I mean you can you can see what
we're trying to do all the time we're
really just trying to push things as
much as we possibly can keep raising the
bar you know Mike life says we've got
the plan
in place it's really just now we've just
got got a continue implementing things
the way we've been doing it and we'll
keep on raising the play accounts
allowing allowing more ships into the PU
and so hopefully we'll reach a point
where people consider the amount we've
cut to to be massive and so yeah with we
think it's feasible we're going to keep
keep going towards it another question
from the live chat here
why is serialized variables range
culling less problematic than network
bind calling because to me it sounds
very similar to them yeah it is it is
very similar the the only difference
being that the with serialized variable
calling the entities themselves are kept
around on the clients with bind calling
the binding part is and effectively to
create the entity on the client
connecting it to the network that's the
bind apart and then and letting the
server know that the this entity is
available for to talk to on the client
and so by keeping their entity around we
solve that problem we don't have to get
rid of the density itself which means
that then the data for that entity is
loaded in on the client so what you
could have is a situation where and
you've got a ship and you're a port
olisar you're watching a ship comes and
travel away so if we've been calling
that ship would be unloaded you
potentially lose all the data files and
then if it comes and travel back you'd
have to load those data files in again
and respawn that entity on your client
and that will cause a loading store at
the moment so the reason that we haven't
gone with bone calling for 3/1 is
because we don't want players to
experience additional load installs
beyond what they already do and the
reason it was on the 3-1 roadmap was
because we thought what the hey we'll
give it a try
we'll see how about it actually
but in the process of working towards
3-1 poets have changed a bit me because
always the gamble as to say well for
buying corn was actually going to
improve things or make things worse so
we decided but that we'd shift focus and
make sure that Syria's variable calling
was in and working and then assist with
the develop simulations that are being
done yeah I mean by the gate from the
game code perspective as well what you
always tend to have in engineering is
you can't help but absolute certain
assumptions as to the way things they're
kind of gonna the way things work and if
all of a sudden we've got entities that
were once they're albeit like the other
side of the universe and now they're not
then you can you can apply the nature
the fact that we have right so many sort
of tens of thousands probably hundreds
of thousands of lines of game code
there's going to be places where people
have assumed once an entity exists it's
you know it's kind it's there and it's
not it's not being sort of pulled in and
out depending on whereabouts you are in
the server so yeah there's there's a
little bit fix up time we're gonna have
to work our way through yeah next
question says will sir permission be
used to attempt a single worldwide
server side or is ping the unbreakable
barrier and will pings definitely an
unbreakable barrier we are planning on
attempting a single shard and what pings
definitely going to be the big obstacle
that we're gonna have to face so a
number that I've kind of got in mind is
I think it's Australia two parts of the
US as something like typically like a
200 millisecond ping the EU to us
something around on
milliseconds or so so that they're not
insignificant latency so potentially
what we could do is try and find a
server that's geographically in the
middle of the players who are
interacting at that point and try and
locate all the players who are interact
and so all the players were in Portales
all be on the same server in the same
server would be in the geographic middle
somewhere of all the players are out of
court also at that point in time and try
and optimize the ping that way for as
many people as possible and what we
could do as well is we could kind of
layer the servers in a sense so everyone
connects to their regional server or
servers closest to them in a regional
data center and then those servers then
communicate with one that's
geographically centered around the
others that are connecting it so you can
try and minimize the ping that way and
some of its going to come down to and
trying to find techniques to hide the
latency as much as possible and it's it
really depends on the gameplay situation
it is obviously it's mostly going to
affect fast combat and yeah it's gonna
be challenging I don't I don't have any
definite answers about how we're gonna
tackle all that but we've got to build
the tag first so that we can attempt to
try and find solutions to those problems
and the other thing to say is that
probably arena commander and star marine
it's not fully this idea or they'll
probably always be am region based so
you'll always be connecting to your
local server for those games so they
should always have nice sharp low pings
fair enough next question actually came
in both the thread and the live chat is
buying culling of distant objects
problematic problematic for implementing
optical magnification equipment like the
endeavour's telescope arrays and yes yes
it's going to be a bit awkward so um the
way we can the cool thing is not just on
a distance basis it's
kind of a as observed sighs so if you
imagine holding you your arm out in
front of you you thumb up and you kind
of anything that appears bigger than
your thumbnail to you is something that
we'd want to keep in anything that's
small and the size of your thumb there
it would be something that would get
cold and so adding the telescope on
obviously means that you feel the view
and it gets narrower when you're looking
through a telescope so everything that
appears much more magnified so that that
means that you can see much smaller
objects so that we have to keep in
things that are much further away it's a
yes it's it's going to extend the ranges
a lot it could be a bit of a problem I'm
sure it'd be fine but it's a it's
something that I'd like that game
designers to reign in police yeah I
think this or similar similar kind of
issues with comes as well because
obviously you know if you if you talk
into if you talk into my multiple people
in multiple locations you know all of a
sudden it's miss Eyre the challenges
students or figure out how we can like
accommodate that situation without
taking the load of every location that's
that we want us that we want to show
show and show some detail in this that
is one of the probably the most
challenging gameplay aspects we have to
deal with yeah well luckily we've got
we've got some time ahead of us that
work on that stuff we'll performance and
optimizations help with older pcs so
people won't have to spend more out of
pocket pocket to be up to par yes and
we'd like to so make it clear as we're
on them that all the optimizations we're
doing code wise they're not specific to
any particular machine specs you know
the code doesn't really
really care whether it's high end or low
end machine that it's going on
you know if we're putting optimizations
in the you know we found something oh
you don't need to update this this
object in this situation or you know we
can you know we cut down my mounts of
sort of expensive code that we that we
call in and you know those those kind of
fixes will welcome apply to both low end
and high end so so I think that all
there it's it's probably like hard to
sort of hard to judge exactly how much
on each on like a high end versus a low
end you save but the code is fixed for
both so you should see you're saving in
both the a the aim is to optimize across
the board kind of applies for services
as well
because obviously they're super high-end
pcs if you want to think of them that
way so any any optimizations we do will
benefit the servers as well as clients
yeah
triple win from the live chat here some
players are getting massive CPU spikes
and PU what optimizations do you think
will really impact client CPU load um
well I think the thing we need to do is
diagnose exactly why those spikes are
occurring without that information you
can't really you can't really tell what
the optimizations are going to be yes
yeah we need to we need to find the
problems and fix them we've got plans in
place to to do that those so when
they'll be a year you know there's been
new telemetry systems then added
recently was talked about around the
verse and eyeball see em in Frankfurt
and so he's been putting stuff in that
all them do things like automatically
capture and performance telemetry when
the framerate dips below
a certain threshold so whether it's in
our internal playtests or potentially we
we have plans to sort of take it take
telemetry from people from backers
playing in the game on live as well so
basically we should we should be able to
get to lament tree for these and drops
in performance and then we can analyze
it and say you know in my video it's the
game code oh it's the physics oh it's
network and so we've really just got it
we've really just got a kitty you know
it's this bit like catching fish yeah
who's we just really need to cast the
line now and hopefully service that if
there are any if there are any whoppers
out there then you know we just we just
hope into reel them in sooner rather
than later gam fixed up you know we've
we've got much better systems in place
for free one to catch those things and
also those new telemetry frameworks and
the idea with them as well it's kind of
to constantly pull in data as well so
it's not just about the framerate drops
it's about kinda like the baseline
performance as well so you know we
should have much more accessible ways
for your average engineer in the company
to look at the performance of the game
go these ten functions or the the
slowest in the game oh look one of them
one of them something that I know about
I can fix that and so it'll be a lot
more transparent as to where the issues
are and then that should lead to mean
fixed fixed up a lot faster and so we're
kind of hopeful with the tools we're
getting in place a much better and it is
is a gradual process it's some days some
days you can get some good wins over
days you sort of scratching around and
you feel like if you go to places where
you'd love to be able to optimize it but
it's much more tricky
so we're yeah then going off on a bit of
a tangent there
yeah we've got we've got plans we've got
plans to get these framerate drops and
get to get them so it as soon as
possible yeah I got I got a suggestion
for an out if we have a bunch of CPU
space just turn off physics just we need
physics just turn off physics if we have
a whole bunch of CPU that's a free one
for me to you brother friend as well
like have you guys started to work on
optimizing any part of squadron 42 yet
or are you still figuring out the best
practices for that now to apply the
squadron 42 later well the way we build
in the game and star citizen and
squadron 42 we're sharing the code base
and so really a lot of the optimizations
we're applying already and will benefit
squadron 42 and anything that sort of
maybe it's like sort of range based
optimizations visibility based
optimizations I what can you sort of
turn off at rate range or when you can't
see it also pointing systems to make it
easier to sort of time slice update so
you might only need to update certain
objects once every sort of second as
opposed 60 times a second or in some
cases you might you might only need to
update things at once every five minutes
and really those kind of systems that
we're putting in a PI it will apply to
both squadron 42 and star citizen this
sort of the goals that Chris wants us to
move towards so more more systems that
kind of what we call LOD updates which
we're Ladas level of detail so the idea
might be you can have a AI character
loaded in memory sort of very far away
but for the for the client they don't
need to run such a detailed update
function for film in that situation as
opposed to when
I get closer the will be will be certain
optimizations that are specific to
certain squadron 42 and their star
citizen for example the network
optimizations well you know just apply
to star citizen they'll likely be a
bunch of stuff we can optimize in
squadron 42 that we maybe can't optimize
in in star citizen because it's a
single-player tile and so yeah with
we're thinking about it we're getting
optimizations in already the that will
benefit it so yeah it's in our it's in
our minds and we've got guys upstairs or
working on it now so if the when the
performance gets yeah when when the
performs gets not so good in certain
areas up there we know about it down
here on the on the PU floor and we're
there try notes we're with them and
helping briefings what are the current
and forecasted blockers to be able to
spawn capital ships like the javelin or
the idris in the PU what needs to be
added either feature performance wise
for this to become feasible I think yeah
not to for me I think feature wise
there's issues with the sheer size of
the ships and there aren't London parts
big enough for them so there's some
docking collars of docking technology
that was required and performance wise
we've had addresses in demos it's a blue
it was a Gamescom last year so the
technology performance technology is
there it just needs improving I don't
think it's a million miles away
on the network side of things I think
we're we're probably okay because we
don't really treat these big ships any
differently than we do a player or
anything else it's all
all the same solder stands these stores
I don't think there's any big lockers on
gameplay side no I mean for us or a game
code wise it's really just the push
towards object container stream in I'm
also the ability to stream ships on the
background threads which should come in
as part of the object container
streaming work and that you know that
that'll eliminate the stalls that you
see when you spawn a few ships at a time
you know we can aware of those issues QA
a tell us about those issues as
engineers we just have to go it's going
to be fixed 33 so yeah I mean obviously
from a gameplay perspective you know the
bigger the ship the bigger the store
when it loads in because there's more
entities that make make off the ship so
whilst it's maybe not a blocker in the
sense of you know we can spawn we can
spawn big ships at the moment again to
get them to a point where they were
where it's good enough to get them
actually actually in the game and for
the releases and yeah we just we just
need to get that sort of spawning on the
background thread a few more these
optimizations in and yeah we're just
building up to I mean you know we've
already got ships in the game like the
Star Ferry which is pretty massive and
so the reclaimer in 3-1 yeah yeah so so
we're going pretty big already but yeah
the the addresses is pretty massive
we'll get there we'll get there well
Clive and Rob you did it you survived
you've done your our caustic three here
at three years and I haven't lost to Deb
yet probably let you go is there
anything you want to say to the
community you you it's not that code
anything anything at all you want to say
to the community for me let you I'm now
you just said it for BJ thank you for
that yeah it's just said yeah well we're
just I'm having a great time making this
gay
and you know I really appreciate all the
support we got just seeing a bunch of
the backers that they don't so it's you
know it's real pleasure to be involved
in the project and yeah just hope you
enjoy the work and I hope we get it bit
faster for you next time all right well
guys we're going to take a short break
we're gonna watch the second half of
that an awesome black Cutlass video and
then we'll be right back with our
wrap-up stay tuned well that about wraps
up this week's show a special thanks to
Clive and Rob Johnson no relation for
allowing me to run that diehard joke
right into the ground this week a couple
housekeeping tasks before we let you go
the ageist Vulcan concept promotion is
still available through April 2nd as is
the paint and library decal 2-pack for
everyone even those waiting to get the
shape the ship in the game then on
Monday next week to check out an all new
episode of calling all Deb's where we
discussed the future of outpost service
a hot fixes repair enough for three
point three how player 2 player
interdiction will work and the future of
player hangers in star citizen it's not
one you're gonna want to miss for a
reverse live on content manager Jared
Huckaby
we'll see you next week everybody
thanks for watching for the latest and
greatest in star citizen the squadron 42
