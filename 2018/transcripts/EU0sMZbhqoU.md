## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Shawn Tracy
technical director of content tech art
tech animation general tools and engine
tools and I'm sandy sandy Gardner so
this week we bring you a very special
episode we'll get to our monthly star
citizen project update followed by a
look at the ongoing optimization
processes and Jessie Spano will learn
about the dangers of too much caffeine
what we're joking of course but this
episode is special as it is our first to
be filmed in front of a live studio
audience
[Applause]
that's right we're very excited to
welcome some of our subscribers joining
us here today in our LA studio they're
getting an up-close look at our studio
as well as the absolutely thrilling
world of a TV hosting segments and
that's not sarcasm folks we've already
had to pee a storm-off set and just
minutes ago jarred flipped the craft
services table you have craft services
all joking aside we do have a lot to
cover in our star citizen project update
for March let's check in with Ricky
Jetley and see what's been keeping the
devs busy since our last update taken
away Ricky hi and welcome to this one's
update on progress for the persistent
universe the UI visual team have been
working on the visor vehicle status
Holograms which have been extensively
rewritten to utilize the new RTC
technology developed by the render team
previously vehicles displayed on the HUD
visor were constructed using the same
hierarchy as a separate entity from the
vehicle you are viewing with the
introduction of RTT the vehicle scene
and the visor or MFT is now actually a
rear ender of the full vehicle this
means that rather than being an
imitation of the target it's now a true
reflection of what's in Weld or space
and accurately reflects all the real
parts and attachments like the thrusters
and weapons this was accomplished by
building a list of the render nodes that
were selectively rendered to a render
target using a custom material shader we
can apply the color tinting to visualize
the damage status of the vehicle parts
whilst avoiding some of the more
expensive features of doing a full
physically-based
forward render this render target
vehicle can then be rendered whenever
the player selects the own or target
view on display this was hardwired to
exist on the helmet visor in three Oh
but in three one you'll be able to
enable it on the MFD displays as well
the visor and MFD displays all have
their own render targets which the to
DUI gets displayed on plus an optional
camera that can show a vehicle to yes we
have a render target objects rendering
other render target objects it's all
very inception and can be quite
confusing working out who is rendering
what sometimes
we also use the same RTT technology when
rendering the communication system often
referred to its cons instead of
selectively rendering the vehicle we
actually rendered the full scene camera
of the pilot to a render target so the
player can see who they are
communicating with this comms render
target similar to the vehicle via status
Holograms can then be displayed on any
given displays render target whether
that is a vehicle's MFD screen the mobi
glass or the visor one thing we're
introducing for the 3-1 release is the
ability to dictate the camera angle when
viewing your vehicle or the focus
vehicle this allows the player to view
them from a series of fixed camera
angles such as top bottom left side
right side etc this is the addition to
the live view which shows the vehicle's
orientation from the pilots perspective
another piece of new tech we added 43.0
and are improving 43.1 is how the
vehicle displays it described initially
we started with a fixed list of displays
which were available per dashboard
describing each of the displays
available for example the Gladius pilot
see has one heads-up display and six MFD
display screens we have now added the
ability to connect additional auxilary
displays we currently utilize this by
connecting the visor display and the 3d
radar display this feature will
eventually allow the player to customize
their cockpit by allowing them to add or
remove auxiliary displays as they desire
when the visor connects to the dashboard
it plugs in has multiple additional
screens for the UI to utilize meaning we
can pipe views from the various
controllers to these optional visor
screens some examples would be the
target vehicle hologram the energy view
and the weapon to you the procedural
planetary team have continued to make
improvements to the planet tech we added
a new way to support multi channels
while improving the color blending and
breakup all of which operate at the same
runtime performance costs as the current
tech transitioning from the ground to
orbit is now a much smoother experience
thanks to the strides made in color
blending we also separate the ecosystem
procedural distribution setup from the
rendering channels I setup which means a
large number of these changes will be
visible on yella in the 3-1 release
finally we also improve the existing
tools to reposition all planetary
outposts automatically the environment
team are finalizing the last few pieces
of the truckstop exterior and are
incorporating the new common element
hangars with work on lighting polish and
advertising to follow for interiors the
procedural layer tool is now
automatically generating lots of
successful layouts for us overnight this
is using only the base library of rooms
available but we are already seeing some
unusual and visually diverse layouts we
estimate we've crunched through around
1000 layouts so far during the initial
period of development not all have been
suitable for use but it's a good
indicator of the amount of variety we
can achieve using the tool we have a
number of ships and vehicles approaching
the flight ready phase and the VFX
Department have been a busy adding
effects to them including the anvil
terrapin the misc razor and the tumbrill
cyclone as well as the aegis reclaimer
[Music]
they've also been focusing on impact
reworks for weapons such as the Gemini
r97
the PRA our distortion Skagen and
scourge railgun during their recent
sprint EU gameplay for each team one
completed all their new tasks work for
the PM AVMA and are now in the process
of bug fixing and polishing for
inclusions in 3.1 another big push for
the next release was to replace the
bespoke customization screen we
currently have for star marine to bring
it in line with the codebase already
shared between arena commander and the
loader apps in MOBA glass this will
allow us to only update one single piece
of code that is shared across all
loadout customization screens it's a big
saving for code as we only need to fix a
bug once rather than multiple times this
means that each interface for the
players only need to learn a single
system so any user experience
improvements will be felt on all loadout
screens for the future the appearance is
admittedly still very rough as we've
been focusing our attention on making
sure the code works correctly and that
the functionality is not lost
in fact switching to the new interface
means their players can now mix and
match light medium and heavy armor
pieces individually with the weight of
armor playing a more important role the
stability for star marine players to
customize various parts adds an
extremely good level of strategy to the
game the code work for this
functionality is now in place so the UI
team will begin updating the visuals and
bringing the quality over the next week
for 3/1 at the same time the UI team is
also hard at work on wider visual
improvements to the MOBA class up itself
along with prototyping the new layout we
showed a few weeks ago an ATV we're also
looking at ways to increase the
visibility of MOBA glass in general one
of the big improvements we're hoping to
achieve is for the mobi glass to occupy
more of the screen space in an effort to
increase the legibility and clearly
display the many visual elements finally
the teams looking to bring up the
quality of the apps by adding additional
improvements to the rendering rules and
shaders applied to the 3d models we
should create a very good noticeable
improvement to inventory management for
three
1-1 the tech art team in LA has been
continuing to work on the character
customizer a new looping idle animation
was chosen to provide some variation in
body movement instead of a single
deadpan facial animation a selection of
more expressive facial Alan's were
implemented and randomized in mannequin
to bring more life to the character
model in addition all selected options
now have work-in-progress icons with the
technology needed to display preview
icons for selectable items like skin
tones and hair colors which will now be
complete the final polished icons for
each selection types are planned for the
near future
next the non head body parts had a
specular highlight passed by the
character team after the team decided
that the heads needed a polish path to
match the rest of the body parts as well
as a line pass to add fidelity to the
head detail another area of focus is a
transition between the head and body
textures previously a visible scene was
noticeable between the head and the
torso so the team worked on making the
transition much smoother thus removing
the scene we have also had significant
improvements to the camera system the
field of view camera position and the
depth of field parameters were adjusted
to create a more dramatic presentation
of the selection character in the
environment and finally for this team
various issues with persistence
specifically saving and entering the pu
have been addressed some bug's popped up
while working on the character
customizer like selecting items saving
and then entering the pu other issues
such as quickly skipping through
selections or cancelling were also
discovered and addressed teams in Austin
Los Angeles have been working on the
service beacon which marks the beginning
of the player generated content although
this is only the beginning 43.1 were
planning on allowing players to pay each
other for services such as personal
transport or combat assistance once a
contract has accepted quantum travel
markers will be created on the contract
initiator so the service provider can
easily get to them both parties will be
able to see where the other person is
while the contract is active either
party involved in the contract can can
anytime but be warned you'll be able to
raid the other person where contract
completion is not easily determined for
instance when does combat systems end we
are close to finishing our second sprint
on this feature we're still trying to
get the backend services for the system
online and we've been running into a few
issues where the system is not yet
communicating properly with the
diffusion services that keep us multi
server and multi thread safe the
character team spent some time fixing a
few bugs that were preventing helmet
lights from operating as expected such
as one example where lights persisted
when you take off your helmet the team
has also been working on an annoying bug
where players were able to wear their
hats and helmets at the same time that's
it for this month's update for the work
being done on the persistent universe as
always thanks to our subscribers for
sponsoring this and all of our shows and
of course thank you to all our backers
for continuing to support the
development of both Star says and
squadron 42 we'll see you next month
thanks Ricky as you can see from ship
hood improvements to planet tech - Moby
glass enhancements so the devs remain
busy with the push towards alpha 3.1 yep
there are many features and upgrades
like these planned for all four of our
quarterly releases throughout the year
one item that will be particularly
focused on now is performance
optimization yes these ongoing
improvements to frame rate will continue
to be developed throughout the alpha
phase and beyond let's hear more about
the entire optimization process from the
team that's been working on it in this
week's feature
optimization one of the big big big big
things that we're trying to focus on
this year the biggest problem is we have
a wear space game right we have a lot
and I mean a lot of entities too many to
count
and I'm sure someone will put a number
somewhere the more entities you have
sometimes they need to do some complex
logic and they may have to update to add
a timer check a timer do something to
continue the game going forward and if
you have a lot of these it could be a
very problematic thing if everyone has
to update these every frame if there's
5,000 things that's five tiles and
things someone has to do before the next
frame could occur from a book ID few a
video game as a visualization of an
simulated virtual bird constructed out
of a basic update loop consisting out of
a few simple steps sample input external
inputs I accept at the beginning of the
frame so that game can react to those
such input can be keyboard mouse
controller input but other network data
in case of a multiplayer game update
words dead the virtual world has a state
such a state is a multitude of things
like the kind of objects which exist
it's a position their color player heads
values and so on this state can change
over time for example an egg and walk
from point A to point B doing the steps
that changes over time are computed the
SD wendice in the last step during each
frame so when knowing here it is data
mined what is visible to allow the play
I look into the simulated virtual world
objects which are determined to be
visible as and worn on the display we
will focus on the update simulation and
when the scene steps those are the
performance critical ones without going
into too much detail it can be said that
each of those steps requires a fixed
amount of operations mathematical or
logical to update the word state and
refresh the displayed image if all those
operations can be done within one
sixtieth of a second as within 60
milliseconds we redo the rule update
loop 60 times each second resulting in
60 fps
frames per second but the source
operation take 50 millisecond the game
will refresh a scene only 20 times a
second
resulting in 20 FPS the real point of
performance optimization is to find ways
to reduce the fixed amount of operations
to be able to execute them within the
target firmware on the target hardware
to better explain what performance
optimisation consists of in modern games
the previous mental model of the basic
update loop must be extended by some
more details by the upcoming explanation
will still omit many parts it forgives a
more accurate explanation of interaction
of various hardware components like CPU
and GPU to go back to the initial
example a single frame looks like this
here we use an imaginary execution unit
which does all the processing for the
word update and to see my name the input
sampling is omitted as it is generally
doesn't affect performance but nowadays
practically each computer has a chip
specifically developed for rendering the
GPU those two workers normally split
between the CPU and GPU it is
immediately clear that such a setup is
not very resource efficient the GPU and
CPU are running in lockstep and only one
of the two chips actively doing
computations at a time you can improve
the situation by letting the GPU work on
one film by the CPU update the
simulation of the next film in parallel
this pattern is called pipelining and
appears everywhere and working with
computers for example and watching
online videos the next few frames are
downloaded by the already downloaded
films a processed and displayed in
parallel but pipelining doesn't come
without implications and the CPU
produces the data faster than the GPU
can process it the GPU will act more and
more behind the flaking behind will be
perceived as additional latency on top
we need to store the CPU computed state
some main memory by the GPUs and
relative processor and there's no device
as infinite memory we need to stop the
CPU at some point and love the GPU to
catch up as we cannot store more state
forever here we speak of CPU being
blocked waiting for the GPU a starter
doesn't be generally up for better
latency in only love's GPU to lag behind
up to 1
the same problem can happen the
different valve on if the consumer is
processing the data faster doesn't the
producer which is called starvation in
general one component will always be
slower than all other components which
implies that the game will always be
bound by something here CPU or GPU does
the first goal of performance
optimization is to identify which
components perform to spawn if the
framerate won't be affected if you
optimize GPU performance by the GPU as
already started this approach is also
called critical path analysis as it
helps to identify the fast which
terminates performance a similar complex
situation emerged on multi sweating CPUs
the HDP you know is a multiplex acute in
units which we refer to as hard
passwords to cope versus strategies you
need to be found to distribute
separations over the different Hardware
sweats the obvious choice is to use the
same pipe any approach as with GPUs but
that has two large 12x and CPUs work
balancing a Shawn and GPU CPU examples
the system will always be bound by the
slowest component to parented CPU work
we would need to find chunks of work
which alert chico together and always
takes the same time this in itself was
very hard to impossible in a dynamic
game and with the increasing number of
hardness wet CPU cores we would soon run
out of systems to put beside each other
it would either need a specific set up
for each different CPU core count
residing in a maintains nightmare which
is why our chosen approach is to batch
the privations and to utilize inherent
parallelization found in video games for
example there's fairly only once in your
character to update so we can put each
different character onto a different CPU
core the theme happiness was any kind of
objects which we have this pattern
allows us to scale more flexible with
the CPU cores the process to change all
the game logic is ongoing
and we are moving more and more parts of
the game logic over to this approach to
atlast more CPU cores more frequently
and improve our performance in port
Latin see the roots 30 with 60fps
discussion in the context of games it's
not only about our curriculum refreshes
and it
visual quality this other about input
latency input latency is normally
measured in firms if each firm needs a
fixed amount of operations regardless of
the underlying hardware so if we need
three frames from user input say we
display an effect the input will have an
input latency of three times 60
milliseconds resulting in their 48
milliseconds even running with 60fps if
our games run to 30 FPS which means a
firm duration of Seleucia milliseconds
it will have an input latency of 99
milliseconds nearly doubling the time
between input and a visual reaction
without being less fluent impression of
the game adding more part banding here
would only increase the perceived
latency which is why we try to not
depend on pipelining for performance on
the CPU even if it would result in a
better frame rate if it will cost us a
verse and not really acceptable input
like one of the questions we get asked
quite a lot is with our server having a
target frame rate of 30 frames a second
and clients having their target frame
rate of 60 frames a second how's that
possible
why aren't they tied together and the
reason for that is that we're not
operating in something called lockstep
and lockstep would be where the server
sends an update and the client has to
wait until it receives an update before
it goes okay this is where they sense
the should be and then has to wait for
another update and goes right ends these
moves to here and so on what we actually
do is the several sanity's updates 30
frames a second the clients running at
60 frames a second in theory the client
should receive an update for entities
every two frames so it has to kind of
guess what's happened in the middle
frame so basically what it's doing is
its locally simulating all the entities
so an entity moving across the flat
plane fixed speed and a fixed direction
it can guess where the entity should be
at each point and it'll get the yet the
next update from the server and go
mm-hmm that's slightly out from where it
should be uh needs a nudge that one a
little bit over to the left a bit layer
down on all the entities turned a bit so
I need some logic
a little bit over the other way so that
allows that the client the service have
different frame rates and we don't have
to worry about doing something like
operating in lockstep or any other
language which can cause big issues
because of latency on the set on the
internet and how that varies quite
randomly all the time it would be quite
a bad experience it's alright for things
like ten based games and but something
like you know a live-action game like
we're trying to David it's just not
going to work
reducing the amount of operations can be
achieved in multiple ways which one is
used mostly depending on the current
situation time to implement it and so on
most often multiple approaches are as a
combined detecting objects too far away
to absorb as a player here we need to
decide after which distance you want to
disable objects what to do it's a gray
area of an object's are barely visible
how to make it look like objects moved
by the player wasn't looking at it in
various other corner cases let us assume
a system where we need to keep track of
1000 objects in a single list if we
delete such an object you must remove it
from our list the straightforward
approach is to check each entry in our
list for our object and we found it we
will move the object afterwards we copy
each following object in the slot before
it to fill up the hole from removing the
object this will always require 1000
operations such an approach can work
well for a small list but if the list is
large or if you remove objects very
frequently it will take a good chunk of
our precious operation budget just we
need a smarter solution inside each
object we will remember the position
inside our list
let me now remove an object we
immediately know it's position then we
can take the last element in the list
place it into the hole and update its
reference to this moved object missus
we're down to four operations from 1000
which is a nice performance game but the
other change to behavior if you know we
are the objects in our list such ririn
can be okay or not depending on how the
objects in the list are used this was
only one example of an optimization of a
very small part of Cebu game
in general
the wool optimization processes
iteratively finding where the game is
bound CPU GPU of each CPU sweat batch
and come up with a better solution to
use less operations for the most
expensive sections there are many moving
pieces to this puzzle generally the tech
content or tech art people will be
focused on the GPU side of the thing the
the number of draw calls we have about a
budget of about 2500 draw calls for all
ships on screen at one time and a ship
can be anywhere between 500 draw calls
to 800 draw calls at its highest
resolution so we try to optimize that as
best we can we have a few tricks in our
bag to do that one of the things is LOD
s we have artists creating a level of
detail meshes which reduce the number of
polygons and reduce the materials as you
go into the distance these are being
hand done and also generated by our
simplygon tool we're also reducing the
damage we're doing or reworking some
damage on old legacy model ships say
that like the Mustang when you blow up a
ship you have all these little pieces of
debris that used to be hand modeled now
we actually just break the ship hull in
half and and change the shader so you
see some little called UV to damage this
reduces the number of debris items and
therefore reduces the number of draw
calls quite a bit a draw calls are liked
and material passes on a mesh so we're
really one of the other ways we can
reduce draw calls is by combining meshes
together and what as a process called
skinning and as I work on landing gear I
can take many pieces of the landing gear
Pistons and gears and and the feet and
combine them into one mesh and I drive
that all through a skeleton so instead
of 10 pieces with 10 draw calls each you
get one mesh with 10 draw calls so
really good significant savings there
another trick that we do is call
with our viz areas and portal culling so
when we're on the outside of the ship we
don't want to draw the interior and even
when you're another room in the ship we
don't want to draw the next room you can
think of portals as as like as I get
door when it's open it draws the inside
of the room when it's closed it calls
the room in the geometry out we use our
visitor portals to connect to the doors
which animate open and close and then
drive the portal to turn on and off and
like say the caterpillar those doors are
skinned so they're optimized and they
have portals on them you will have
noticed there are some issues with the
portals recently and we are working on
about four or five major portal issues
but we will get them and it will be you
know a faster and cleaner and you can
walk outside again and then see the
exterior in space by standing on your
deck another thing that's being worked
on right now is called signed distance
fields and this is a technology that our
Chris Rayne is working on it's a
different way of describing a volume by
recording these distances so it's stores
distances and what we've done to this
point is use a volumetric approach where
we have these box holes and we fill the
ships with voxels and this gives us our
local physics grid but when we move to a
signed distance field it'll be much
faster we can describe shapes much more
a much higher resolution and we'll know
more immediately if you're inside the
ship or outside the ship colliding with
the ship or not this is gonna open the
door for new shield tech a new visual on
the shields so instead of a bubble
that's kind of you know loosely shaped
around the ship you'll see a very tight
shield that that pushes just out from
the plates of the ship and also one of
the things we're excited about is of
course when we break the ship's in half
the
sighing distance feels gonna is like a
first step in getting us our multi
physics grits so we'll be able to keep
the interiors around and then allow you
to reclaim and walk around in the end
the ships after a battle so you'll find
new items and things that way Network
code was a big performance bottleneck on
the server and the reason being the that
24 clients that we were supporting and
PU at the time to gather all the
information from the simulation had to
write it out
24 times to each different Channel and
the way it would do this is if you think
about different threads each CPU doing a
different amount of work you kind of
have the the main thread running along
this way coming right there's a frame
there's a frame and each point in the
frame towards the end of the frame won't
go right now that Wako go off do you
think right some store folks and that
work go it on the phone go okay right
and start doing stuff and as long as it
is finished before the main thread
started the next frame everything was
fine but if the network code is running
a bit slow then it would stall the next
frame on the main thread it causes that
some wait until the network started
finished by the time 3.0 came out we
kind of well came out with quite a few
the network changes that we've been
planning so without the introduction of
serialize variables that's been him for
quite a while
by the time 3.0 came out pretty much all
of the game code had been conveyed from
using the old aspects and our mind
systems to the replacements which is
serialize variables and remote methods
and what that meant for us is that we
could focus our efforts on optimizing
one particular code path and we just
leave the legacy system not performing
as well as we'd like but because not so
much stuff who's using it it's not
really an issue the big kind of
difference we made the serialize
variables is that the fat
from the game saying okay what's the
state of everything but the things that
have changed and we need to update watch
the current state because I need to send
that across the network that was
paralyzed so instead of the network
thread doing all the work at a
particular sing point with the main
thread it would just go okay how many
threads have we got available okay all
of you go and group grab some data and
send out some that way and then the next
part would be okay now we need to take
that data and we need to send it off to
each of the different channels so that
they know that they need to do some work
and the channel being a the network
codes representation of a climb so then
that was paralyzed as well and then the
final part before our lives was the okay
now we've actually all the channels
we've got the day that they need to send
we need to actually go and send it so
that was paralyzed as well so we went
from one thread doing all the work just
splitting it over as many threads as we
had available so on the clients we've
kind of got the opposite situation where
they're receiving all these updates on
the server it'll come in through the
socket they'll get processed by the
network thread and then there'll be a
sync point with the the main thread
it'll go okay right
no it's ready I mean photos ready here's
all your data this is what's being
received from the server right go off
and do you next you know be a simulation
that part has always been pretty pretty
quick to be honest and Hong Kong clients
were talking about roughly a millisecond
to process all that they had even though
it takes proportionally quite a lot
longer to write the day erect and
package it all up on the server the
unpacking of it's out always been quite
quick so the network code itself has
never been a performance issue and for
clients because they're mostly just
receiving data from the server and what
they actually sent is so much smaller
than what the server sends that it's
never really been an issue for them at
all so buying calling supposed to
address this say
this mismatch between client and server
the share process and power that you
have on servers and their ability to
process everything and the much smaller
processing power than most clients will
have and the idea behind buying Colin is
that a clients only really interested in
what's immediately around it anything
that's on a different planet or a couple
of hundred kilometers away and even out
in spaces no no way you could reasonably
say it just shouldn't be there and by
that I literally mean that your client
should not know about it at all that
would save all the processing of those
entities on the client it would save a
bit of processing work on the server
because it doesn't have to communicate
information about those entities to your
client so it's definitely something we
want to do and it's just it's not
particularly easy thing to do you need a
way of controlling the updates on the
server so that it's only updating not
all the entities it knows about but it's
only updating the ones that it knows are
in range of any player at all so the
ones that no player can see just doing
little date and it saves processing time
on the server and we've had to change
assumptions on the networking code side
where previously it would say okay I've
got an entity it's a network density
every client needs to know about this
and be assumptions all the way through
the network code that relied on that not
being true so we've got to change all
those and so it's a bit by bit process
that we've kind of unraveled stuff and
add the new stuff and optimize stuff
that will allow Baron Collins to be
possible and we're almost there that and
the steps that are left are really if
you imagine a situation that you've got
buying calling in and entities that
aren't immediately around your clients
don't exist what happens when you fly to
a different location
so you quantum travel to a different
planet you need all those entities to be
there so they have to be spawned so say
I was good to tell you about those
entities information comes over the
network and then your client has to go
and create them up until now all the
entities all the entities spawning as
being synchronous or called blocking
which means that the point in the code
where it says why I need this entity
it'll basically stop whatever it's doing
it'll go and load the data in for that
entity create the entity itself register
it with physics and whatever else it
needs to do and then go okay this
function can exit let's carry on and do
the rest of the game so we need a
synchronous fantasy spawn which is also
known as object container streaming the
idea being that a client will get a
message from server and go okay I need
this entity he'll go off and go okay
well what files does a sense they need
to load what data doesn't need to load
so I'll go off and do that on the
background thread okay I finish loading
that okay now I can create the entity
and it's not stalled the processing of
the game it's not stalled your clients
at all while that's going on you can
continue to play so obviously that takes
a bit longer so the trick is to try and
make sure that you finish spawning
entities by the time they actually
appear so you've got to kind of
preemptively decide to sport and stuff
so that we need this object container
streaming that's that's the technology
that's gonna allow us to do the streamed
events these in in order to be able to
make fine calling work so what I really
want to do is develop the by uncle in
technology finish it off as early as
possible so the in-house we can be
testing it and making sure that it works
finding all the problems that it's gonna
cause perhaps an example of that would
be say you've got a mission from a
mission giver and miles a car and you
need to forego on five miles four miles
of sat in this bar in Levski and you're
on port olisar
so we need a little marker rendering on
your client to show where miles is so
you know where its head but with barn
calling the miles I heart and see won't
be there so what to be draw the marker
on so they'll kind of problems we need
to try and figure out ways to deal with
that there's a couple of different ways
we could do with that situation but
until we do we can't really put bond
calling in because it could break the
gameplay probably going to see the full
implementation of buying calling in
until so we get object containing a
stream in it and put frozen internally
we need to get it as soon as possible so
that we can we can move on with some of
the other stuff that were planning so
what we've kind of done which is another
thing so I've mentioned buying colon of
mentioned object containing extreme then
there's also serialized variable culling
and which is because we can't do barn
calling just yet because gone get out
into the hands of the backers and
serialize variable culling is what we
can do so the way that works is same
sort of distance checks that we're doing
before and if an entity is too far away
clients the server will just say you
know what I'm not actually going to send
you any updates for that entity and what
that will mean is that because the
entities not receiving any updates on
the client the client can go okay well I
can put this entity to sleep I don't
need to do any CPU processing on it you
can just stay where it is so you can get
a lot of the performance gain that we'd
hope to see from behind calling from
this serialize variable to the size of
our games are generally not very
optimized during development it's very
clear that the faster version is more
complex and as more state even the small
example and more complex code means more
places where something can go wrong
resulting in a bug because offices you
always have to decide on the trade-off
between production speed and performance
if we focus everything on performance
feature development will be slowed down
a lot including future features as I
need to be develop
against more complex code base to make
it even worse we could optimize all this
code just to later realize that the
specific part was not really needed or
we need to implement something else
entirely as a feature was simply not fun
there's a famous quote premature
optimization is a root of all evil in
other words we need the rules
final system to correctly understand and
analyze it to make meaningful
performance optimizations but so much
for the theory the critic reality our
game can already be played and playing
with 15fps it's no fun to help the code
leads and production to decide which
features optimization should be focused
on we perform a performance analyzation
sometimes with features need
optimizations to work our features
needed to implement an optimization
resulting in dependencies between
developers making the group progress
more complex other times code changes
are trickier than expected we're going
to do too much risk shortly before
release reciting the new trickle-down
effect of delays for other optimizations
or features we use a set of different
tools for performance analyzation the
very basic tool we are using with a
classic sampling profiler
such a profiler works by stopping the
CPU at a fixed time interval and
recording what the CPU was doing at that
time if a function needs a lot of
operations to live a higher chance to be
executed when the CPU is sampled
resulting in a higher sample count which
indicates a high cost function won't
work of assembling profiler so it only
shows a function where the time spent
but no context of either function was
executed on the CPU in relation to what
other code or high-level state of the
game like the number of active vehicles
for this we use mostly use an
instrumented profiler which shows
executed function antelope when Alera t
but shows what CPU cores executing when
this profiler can either show us plots
of certain performance values we are
interested in those truths are very
useful to analyze a specific situation
but star citizen is a different beast we
have up to 50 players and many more
planned on a single shirt server which
as execute the physics simulation this
means what any player is doing can
affect other players is about making
sure
as law caused me to run my operations
which can be observed indirectly as
jumping movements on the clients Weber
bending and so on all effects of the
server not sending updates frequently
enough when they need to replicate the
server behavior and we also been looking
at some of the telemetry frameworks that
we use to actually help us visualize and
track what the actual performance issues
within the game inside the codebase
actually are some of the improvements
we've done to the telemetry for example
allow us to capture data automatically
during our play tests the day it would
automatically be captured when the
framerate drops below a certain
threshold so for example we can use this
kind of auto capturing to make sure we
grab moments where we see these nasty
bugs occurring which cause big
performance drops we would then take
this data onboard analyze it as a team
and then look to see where the problems
were lying the various problems could
then be either addressed by some of the
engineers on the performance team or in
certain cases we might actually find
that the ownership of the the issues in
question would will be from engineers on
other teams so in that case we'd have to
coordinate with them to look at fixing
off certain issues that that might have
cropped up in the play tests it's
currently quite early stages for the
auto capturing and with the new
telemetry system but the initial tests
seem quite positive so we're hoping for
free one that we see in a lot of these
nasty issues a lot sooner and we're able
to fix them up in plenty of time for the
actual release some of the other things
that we've looked at adding to trap the
perform
are some auto tests the auto tests would
be run by a test build machine once per
internal bill but we do these these
internal tests would be something like
having a automated player walk around a
busy area the games such as Levski or it
could be have the player spawn in into a
ship alongside 30 AI ships and these
auto tests would track various framerate
statistics
allowing us to see as we go from build
build is our performance improving have
we accidentally pushed the performance
back a bit in which case these tests
allow us to catch issues as they arise
and whilst they don't necessarily give a
perfect measure of the performance that
we're likely to see in the live
environment they can at least give us a
good indication that we're moving in the
right direction rather than us putting
in a lot of optimization code changes
and not actually knowing whether the
changes having the desired effect so for
three zero one there's really two good
ways at the moment for us to gather data
from which we can decide what needs
optimizing code wise two ways that we
have at the moment are taking the auto
captured data from the internal play
tests we do with up to 50 internal QA
and a handful of engineer's
participating and the other way we would
look to gather data to analyze to see
what we can optimize is just by doing
local tests around machines when we run
those we can spin up a server connecting
a client we can potentially can
in headless clients should we want we
can play the game fairly normally but
with the additional their debug commands
that are available to us we can do
things like like jump outside olisar
instantly put ourselves in a ship we can
spawn 50a eyes and so we quite quickly
can put ourselves in it in a scenario
that in the real releases would see the
framerate stressed more than just
running around as a single player in all
us are playing on the wise empty server
with those different situations
I'd also tend to do things like spawn
50a I then move the player away to
another location in the game that's far
far away from olisar because then in
that situation we'd sort of expect
really that the performance should
should be better because there's now a
bunch of vehicles on the server but
those vehicles are now so far away from
the players vehicle that we shouldn't
need to update them on the client with
the same level of detail that we
previously did when we were sat right
next to him in and olisar
so we'd be running these various
different scenarios locally taking a
look at a data and by analyzing it we to
look out for instances like that where
we could get some clear gains by not
updating things that didn't need to be
updated we could also take that data and
look into things like what are the most
expensive functions in the game what
what are the functions that are being
called most frequently which functions
take the longest to run which functions
do a lot of allocation and de-allocation
of memory we could also look at
functions that were coming from code
that we didn't actually necessarily even
need to run for various game modes or
code that had been there since we
inherited the engine so we would kind of
look in it looking at ways to improve
pre-existing code that we did need but
also often some of the biggest wins will
be actually removing or refactoring
older systems that we didn't need or
didn't need to use in the ways that we
were currently using them for PE for
example one of the issues that we've
we've always had is being able to to
test with tester savable and a full load
of clients so particularly now we've
gone to 50 players per P Yuma and you
can imagine the amount of manpower it
takes and you know the logistical
nightmare of trying to organize 50
people in QA or you know volunteer
developers to try and play test the game
for a couple of hours and fill the
service and get back performance data
and then it's it's equally it's if you
ask you know so you observe a slow down
while you doing this test if you want to
ask someone what happened you have to
ask 50 people and you get 50 different
answers does this kind of yeah it's
quite difficult to sell the tests and
again the quality of information back
that you require so we're working on and
these things we've got called headless
clients which are basically clients with
our players little they're all dumb
robots still press the keys in random
ways there's no key Bo's just a program
that runs by its virtual keyboard it's
just mashing the joystick and mushing
the keyboard wiggling the mouse and it's
smart enough that it can get out of bed
and get into a ship and then just fly
around and firing in random directions
and that generates enough load that we
can kind of simulate roughly what we can
expect a player might do and previously
the headless clients have only been gone
on development
developers machines and to get enough
headless clients to help felt server
they're being migrated on to virtual
machines running in the cloud so they
have to be spun up on demand and shut
down the other thing I mentioned was
getting back a better quality of
information so we've had telemetry in
the game servers for a while now we've
had some telemetry from clients as well
it's been a bit of a fragmented approach
into how that's being done so we're
working with the engine team and DevOps
again to try and get a more unified
approach get richer information about
what the performance is where the
bottlenecks are on each of the clients
under server try and get more contextual
information about what everyone was
doing there each point in the game so we
could go okay those performance drops
here what was everyone doing all right
that guy catapillar blow it off lots of
cargo okay that's wrong really yeah
with a traditional game you probably
tend to find that the performance for
the majority of the lifecycle the
development would be actually pretty low
probably fifteen frames a second or less
whereas the issue we have is a early
access title if you like is that we've
we've got to get our features in write
our new code write our new systems but
yeah we have to get those systems
performing in an optimal manner that
allows people to play the game at a
reasonable frame rate and enjoy it
rather than having the luxury of only
testing the game internally for the
majority or the development cycle and
then knowing exactly what content we
want in the game knowing what works and
then being able to optimize that in the
last few months of the project so really
we do have an extra overhead of sort of
continual perform
optimizations that we need to look at
but that's all part of the great
challenge that we've got here right in
the code foot and what we all see is a
massive groundbreaking title
Joran development there's never going to
be a line that we're in the cross and
performance is something going to be
fantastic it's always going to be this
incremental process of getting better
and occasion we're gonna get worse so
basically what's what's gonna happen is
as new features come online the first
thing they're probably going to do
besides work fingers crossed
is make performance a bit worse and I'm
long as we've measured the impact we're
going to try and optimize it back up
again to the levels that everybody's
kind of happy with but development being
the key thing it's never going to get to
that kind of 60 frames per second for
everybody because it's more important
that we spend the time on actually
developing the game getting everything
in getting everything working so the
kind of optimizations that we're dealing
with now you know there's a few small
kind of micro optimizations making
things go particularly fast but it's
kind of system level optimizations so
yeah we know we're gonna need buy and
call and we know we're gonna need server
mashing we know we're gonna need the the
entity component update scheduler well
you know we're gonna need object
container streamit so these kind of
system level things these pieces have to
go in so that we can build the rest of
the game but that's the primary focus
important to me it's it's to give us an
attack to build the rest of the game
yeah I guess the biggest takeaway out of
this is there's never one answer an
optimization there's billions I mean
that's why we have those profile markers
in there we need to see what's going on
and work towards generating a solution
to beef up that part of the thread
that's going slow maybe we were to turn
off some updates in the you know that
are out of range used in sterilized
coaling or maybe we have to optimize the
way that weird handling physics on the
planet because this particular way takes
a little bit longer it's analyzing the
data figuring out where 'no thread that
we or
having issues in and then finding a
solution that works for that and doesn't
break the game that's probably the
biggest takeaway in the biggest
challenge optimisation affects everyone
from devs to players we all consider
performance implications as we develop
star citizen and we even have an
optimization strike team to keep up with
our own development that's right and
with 3.1 around the corner we have a few
ships coming online the reclaimer the
cyclone the Terrapin and the razor and
on the concept front the AG is Vulcan
remains available through the end of the
month add one of these versatile support
ships to your fleet and become a beacon
of hope for distressed pilots everywhere
we also have a ship package that
features the Vulcan along with some
other ages vessels and a standalone skin
pack available to everyone that's right
so even those of you waiting to pick up
a Vulcan in-game can secure these
eye-catching paint jobs now make sure
