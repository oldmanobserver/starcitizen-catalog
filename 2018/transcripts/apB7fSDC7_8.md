hey everybody welcome to another edition
of culling of all devs our weekly Q&A
series rhetoricians from you the star
system backer impose them directly to
our developers we're jumping right into
it today because I've been dealing with
technical issues all out of the fund me
happy stuff first call this week is to
look Pressley bigwig out of foundry 42
UK look how you doing hi Chad oh yeah
alright thank you for being patient
we've tried this call like four times we
finally got it we're gonna try to get
this done before we got a question for
you this is a question that comes up
quite frequently in my circles at least
you know spending on as much time on
spectrum as I do the question simply
states coordinates systems when uh what
do we think the chances are what our
intentions what are our future
prognostications if you will about
adding a 3d positioning system so that
we can better tell our friends where we
are in space and our friends can
subsequently find us okay well we
definitely need one and as with my
mission hat on I can't wait to get one
can imagine the kind of puzzle side
things we there will be able to do with
that um okay I mean I need to go away
talk to the system designers and stuff
but I'll hypothesize because I can I can
see exactly how we do it you know quite
straight forward at once you've agreed
on the basics right so if you imagine
the coordinates ran from what's the
origin right is it Earth is it the Sun
you know it would be something like that
because we're humans and we put
everything you know where the center of
the universe and develop a diverse
coordinates just run and run because
you'd end up with huge numbers obviously
or do they may be reset kind of like you
say okay Stanton you're in Stanton so
you like preface it with Stanton and
then say 0 0 the origin is for Sun Sun
riser and just to start again like
otherwise these numbers are just going
to become absolutely unwieldly and
impossible to use and so you know I
think once we figure that out
I agree on that then it should be fairly
straightforward because we we have like
the root you know we have you zones
right the game has sounds like air so
there's a route which is just space and
then there's like you get to a planet
even inside a as a zone right and
every time you step into that you go to
actually let your local coordinates are
in relationship to it so if you were
looking at your your coordinates
stepping inside a ship from space will
change them like it'd be a huge number
when you're in space dam tightening them
because you're only meters away from the
origin of your ship so I mean what like
you can easily get around that can you
assume you can just use for world corner
that's full stop you will always be
inside like a spade a solar system you
know and when you use a wormhole or a
jump point kinda thing you'll come out
in another solar system we just reset
the coordinates to that so either way we
do it if we decide we do it like with
earth being zero zero you basically just
take how far is earth away on the star
map kinda thing and then add on whatever
real world coordinates you getting at
the time on to that and bingo you've got
you've got corners again to unwieldly to
really be telling your friends so we bet
that's the thing we have to figure out
and because like at one point I really
wanted like like sectors on planets so
you can be like oh and and somewhere in
here cuz again with a mission hat like
bets oh great we can say it crashed
somewhere in Sector blah blah blah and
get you searching for it get you scan in
or
and we can still do that even we even
with like coordinates like we've saved a
lot last known you know these things are
basically we're not broadcasting
constantly so they broadcast their
position every minute or something and
when this thing has crashed you know you
only get the last-known coordinates so
you go there and scan yeah so basically
I mean the answer is as soon as we
figure out how to how to be able to
present it in a way that isn't a million
you know I'm at zero for two now in
export like you know forever you know
and and and where do we show it as well
there's another question where do we
show this and because I can't think off
the top of my head a great position for
it like you know bring up my mobiie
glass or you know something like that or
is it always on the screen somewhere and
that's probably not the best way to do
it so the new I guys would need some
buy-in on this as well well yeah it
sounds like it sounds like a question of
skill you have to say how how granular
you you you want to drill down and do it
you know is the universal coordinates
and then there's system coordinates and
then within the system or there are
there sector coordinates as you said and
then on each each planetary body does
each planetary body then have its own
set of coordinates and then do you have
sectors on the planetary body so so yeah
it's a it's a yep you want to you want
to devise a system that is granular
enough to tell to tell to let people
effectively describe where they are if
they pinpoint position book in a
manageable right so you actually work
cut out for him in this is something you
can just hand off to somebody else or do
you have to do it oh well yeah sounds
like a job for that person alright look
I'll let you get back to work hey all
right take him in alright thank you so
much Luke now moving just one row of
seats over to this friend vehicle
pipeline
director John crew we've got two
questions for you about ships and ship
mechanics John ain't on it good things
ready to answer some more questions
someday I'm gonna go that somebody
should count with somebody in the studio
audience go through and count all the
questions and see if John is the person
who's done more than anybody else sighs
I think it's a pretty good bet but I
know Luke Presley is there yeah
shot as well she had Rob Ryan Ruger
makes a help but makes a healthy showing
I'd be curious to know who doesn't need
to scho bold media score would somebody
make me a call held EPSCoR word all
right John I know you got a meeting to
get to so we'll rush through this here
two questions for you right off the bat
if I salvaged a fuel tank off another
ship can I use any of the fuel inside to
get me home
so I don't want to rule things out
permanently forever because sort of
salvage is gonna be not strictly vehicle
pipeline but tr0
no you're just sounding the the item and
everything inside it is just contained
items that goes into it if you're gonna
put it in a big grinder it's obviously
not going to survive the other end maybe
if you have special equipment like you
have the Vulcans drones you would
salvage the fuel separately first I
configure the drones say yeah I'm going
out there and you're looking
specifically for fuel because those
drones can do refill the agree arming
repairing you could use the Vulcan to
know the reverse of refueling that ship
first and then salvage all the parts
manually it's like your scope of cargo
maybe you go out there and cut those
bits but no to start with it's just
you're gonna grab that item it has its
contents and you sell or convert it as
needed and reviewers of calling up as I
encourage you to check out Gant repens
answer it was there last week or the
week before very recently where he talks
about how his team is scheduled to move
on to salvaging as soon as the
completion of asteroid mining coming
soon and now
we is all wrapped up with a nice bow
alright next question for you how about
that bamboo merchant business I know you
had a 50-50 shot whether it was gonna be
the character the man who originally
yeah you could've asked me about the car
we're gonna go with much money I will
never ask you about the carrot come the
show okay
I'm not even talking to you I'm talking
to the Packers this question says what
are the current high-level design goals
for the bad new merchantman has it
changed at all from its original intent
don't think it's really changed from its
original intent OC it's between it the
Carrack and a couple of other ships it's
the the most anticipated or waited ships
its broad high-level goals it's still a
trading ship it still gots shops or
stores inside it where you can sell your
goods trade your goods still a great
little little big ship for being like in
all headquarters so it's got the
accommodation capacity to keep a bunch
of people on board the writers are said
like by new trade negotiations take a
long time so we've built in so I've made
short term it accommodation for guests
it still got those huge honking great
guns to defend itself the one thing that
sort of maybe it's changed maybe it's
not changed but the topic of speed of
the ship a lot of things have been said
about the ship officially and
unofficially and they sort of get warped
over time it is a big ship big ships on
our game are not fast ships so there's a
lot of expectation of this the ship it's
just going to be zipping around all over
the place that's that's not it's big
it's
ft it's armored and it's got the
firepower to offset that you have some
of those bad new defenders flying around
there yeah that's that's the reason they
are there and there is some interplay
between the two that we've built in but
not talked about so there are reasons
and
expect that question to be added to the
October questions threatened to get
voters very quickly so you got you got
about a you got about a month to figure
out your answer that one Josh you're
coming for it for people I got my answer
I'm just gonna save it for the ship
shape but I'll only do it yeah that's
pretty and as for the carrot box people
who take my joking a little too
seriously I am joking about the
character what as soon as the carrot
goes into work I've said this before I
said it on shipshape when the carrot
actually jumps into the production
pipeline when it's actually active and
ready to go you will see a big
announcement from me on ship shape with
colored streamers and yeah that day just
has not come yeah so yeah when that
happens we'll start to have new
information for you but until then all
right John that's it I'll let you know
workman sounds meetings next week
probably oh my son I gotta get to the
top of the lead boat I hear I and
finally last but certainly not least
Austin Texas which is where we find the
designer Rob Reiner another comedy hall
devs all-star Rob how you doing it good
all right how you doing Jerry I'm doing
okay I've got a question for you now I'm
gonna let's do a little behind the
scenes here normally normally panicked
impaired our designers look I sent out
an email we do a conversation before
hand we workshop the answer that's why
we make sure they don't say anything
with the not supposed to get anybody in
trouble you know we don't want
calling all devs canceled because
somebody says something then I suppose
to you and whatnot you know sometimes
that still doesn't work see whatever the
600 I think was from couple months ago I
can't remember
but we don't yet know not you know it's
usually the ship ones that get us in
trouble but Rob I've got a question for
you I have not prepped you on it you
don't know it's coming because this is a
skirt this is a true this is a trolli
question this comes up every once in a
while but for some reason this month it
got voted up so your question is when
when will we finally be able to trade
subdued npcs and other players i can't
say that's currently on the roadmap
human trafficking trafficking yeah know
what I mean there's been comments about
it you know throughout the development
of the game where it's just like yeah
you know because like the slavers you
know are like part of the lore and and
everything right so it's it's come up
but bounty hunting you know yeah that's
another example of it right a lot of
people are looking forward to bounty
hunting we've got the we've got the
anvil Hawk currently in development you
know that the currently building being
built out here by the LA 15 that's a
bounty hunting ship lot of lots of talk
over the years about about being able to
capture NPCs and capture players and
whether when you capture a player it
gives you an NPC copy of that player
maybe I could say so that the player
itself can be free to you continue
playing it stuff like that but yeah has
anything been is anything been fully
hammered out fleshed out decided no I
mean we talked about the bounty hunting
aspect of it you know quite a bit
because we're trying to flesh out like
the roadmap for the next you know few
years but and bounty hunting is a part
of that right but how how detailed
that's going to be for for the tier 0
implementation or for that you know
Minimum Viable Product is still up for
discussion so it's as a tradable
commodity like being able to actually
sell them to another person very far
there is no yeah that's that's like a
whole new level of
kind of craziness there so I I'd say you
know the safe answers probably will have
something available with bounty-hunting
you know being able to trade slaves
probably not going to be anywhere in the
near future
but you never know where star citizen's
gonna go and I can guess on this one our
director of public relations who watches
the show just breathe a sigh of relief
for you you haven't happened there's not
saying yeah I can tell you at this point
hi hi hi you just breathe a sigh like
you said okay training players probably
not on the road we're rocking we're not
gonna add human trafficking to the
roadmap Nick anytime soon talk I'm not
even talking to the back of her I'm
talking to our drew PR go
hopefully honest I wonder if there might
be some I don't know that's so he'd have
to investigate that let's let's get
bounty hunting going let's get back down
to your zero stuff and let's let's put a
pin for now let's put a pin in the idea
of trading other rock layers as a
commodity baby we don't ever want to say
never I'm following all that yeah it's
yeah so that's that's one where we would
might come close to saying but but who
knows you know bounty hunting is
definitely important to us so you
definitely want that you know going and
capturing people and feeling that but
not disturbing the gameplay of other
people like to drastically you know so
that's that's what we're really trying
to work out right now selling people to
other people not probably not in the
cards man right now I will start out in
the cards I know and I know who asked it
it's the same person's been asking that
question for a better part of a year and
I'm not gonna name any names but that
person knows who they are
yeah you know did I get it so that's it
and is it safe to say that just because
you got this question about it out
doesn't mean that you can see throughout
more outrageous stuff and expect it to
be at the top of it I don't mind I don't
mind the array of stuff it's up to the
community whether they whether they want
to blow up calling all the Deb's
question on voting it up or not yeah
apparently up to the community give so
many questions we put that power in
there I robbed anyway that's a good old
man that's so that's the first time I've
ever been asked that question so that's
I got anyone yeah okay thank you sir I
don't you go all right cheers man later
bye
yeah well that about does it for this
week's show especially the things to
Luke Presley and John crew and Rob
Reiner for taking John fruit would run
from taking their time to answer taking
their times remember you can submit your
questions for consideration each and
every week up on the thread up on
spectrum and don't forget to vote that's
the two prong plan you got to submit
your questions you got to butter your
questions the September threat is up now
the October threat goes up next week so
for calling all this I'm Content Manager
for global video production Jared
Huckaby we'll see you next week
