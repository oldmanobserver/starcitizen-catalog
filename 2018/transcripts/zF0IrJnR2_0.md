hi my name is Max hung marked out today
so I'm taking over bug Smashers let's
get
started bug smashes so today we get a
fun little bug that lets you generate
fuel from your heat exhaust and your
power
consumption which means we have finally
overcome
entropy but they don't want it so we got
to get rid of it the way the engine uh
the way the designers to found out about
this that while they were balancing uh
uh fuel while they were balancing pipes
uh they were balancing the fuel
consumption for both all for all the
fuel intakes the fuel tanks and the uh
the flight controller and they noticed
that if they turned everything off and
they just idled a ship and just floated
there they would be generating
fuel so it took a while to dig around
here's what we Ed to
control uh our pipes system so we have
our pipe system that controls how heat
is passed around the ship how power is
passed around the
ship and it turns out that there's this
fun little part where you can decide on
when a pipe comes online and offline and
decide on
where they
would get
connected so the the way that originally
was was that it would just connect to
every kind of every kind of pipes
whatever came online it would
immediately connect to and then you
would be able to see something like
this let me
make yeah all right so here we are in
the code or in the game I made a special
Gladius or I repurposed the old Gladius
to show this off so we
have C bars I can spell
if we burn a little bit of fuel and then
we come to an
idle you
notice come to an idle you notice in the
top right we see that numbers are slowly
climbing up one unit every couple
seconds every other
second this is a special Gladius that
doesn't have any fuel intake so it
shouldn't be generating any fuel at all
but here we see it's coming back up slow
slowly and slowly and
slowly so uh you can see it around this
top right
Cal
so it took a little bit of digging
around and we found out that because the
way pipes work something was pushing
stuff into the fuel pipes and then the
fuel these fuel tanks were taking were
pulling in that that amount of that
amount this this isn't like science
class where you have where units are
important it's just a number goes in
number comes out apparently it's going
into the fuel tanks and we du around and
found that in both the power and the
heat
connection power and heat we were
connecting to any kind of pipes because
there's no specific part where it says
oh this is a heat pipe or a fuel pipe or
whatever and so all we had to do was put
in these checks to make sure that we're
connecting to a power pipe
and if we combine
that we stop the game combine that we do
it over here as well uh what is this
power uh entity
component we do it here as
well on pipe connect
we do
if and I already
forgot hpe
class if we do
that compile the
code this will make sure that our heat
connection will only connect to the heat
pipes and our power connection only
connect to the power pipes so now it
won't be Rand so now these connections
won't be randomly pushing in values
everywhere and breaking the laws of
physics now that it's done compiling we
bring up our same level with the same
Gladius now remember that this is the
special Gladius that doesn't have any
fuel
intakes so we just pipes turn on pipes
turn on the
name sh and notice that if we fly around
you can even
tell right now that you can see the
number is steadily going down I only
took out the fuel intakes but while the
plane is in Flight it'll idle putting it
in idle will keep it burning fuel
so now that we're in Idol and just
floating here it's burning fuel like
it's supposed to to and now the Heat and
the power are no longer contributing to
your fuel intakes and so we have our
disappointing conclusion where we where
we have to follow the laws of physics we
can't just generate fuel from Heats and
pipe we we have to have them contribute
uh we have to have them push their
resources to their proper pipes and not
just to all them which and prevent you
from getting free fuel just by flying
your ship so next time Mark may or may
not be back we'll see what happens next
time this is Max hung thanks for joining
me for bug Smashers thank you for
watching so if you want to keep it with
the latest and greatest in Star Citizen
of Squadron 42's development please

see you soon
