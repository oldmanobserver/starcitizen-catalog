## Transcript

welcome everybody to the second edition
of calling all devs our new weekly
question and answer Series where we take
questions from you the Star Citizen
backer you guys vote on which ones you
want to see us uh answer each and every
week and then I sit here in uh backstage
in our map studio uh because my desk is
way too loud and uh call people on Skype
and get the answers directly from the
proverbial development horse's mouth all
right starting off this week's show with
our most uh voted on questions from our
backers we have two questions here that
I think are perfect for Todd papy so
we're going to give Todd papy a call and
see if he picks up Todd Todd hello hello
how you doing man not too bad not too
bad you're our first repeat guest on
sweet I told you last week that you know
with your new title and everything I was
going to be picking on you quite a bit
and and I I come not only with one
question but two questions it's just how
it happens uh you know our backers
submit the questions they vote on them
on Spectrum so you're gonna get me a
nice big like WWE belt kind of thing for
like uh for a repeat repeat question
abely absolutely and made out of
papermache you know that's fine all
right I G have to learn that of paper
mâché okay all right so we do do this
quick I know you're a busy guy and
whatnot uh star C what is your title now
Star Citizen live director no live live
game director live game director okay
all right so first question submitted by
backers voted on this was our our most
voted on question of the of of the of
the week so far is buying ships with
auec still a planned feature for Alpha
3.1 it is a planned feature however with
our current optimization plan and
everything like that I don't think it
will be hitting in 3.1
okay uh and then the uh next one uh what
are the plans for adding a transfers
between player
characters so we actually already have
that in a in one of the designs for
service Beacon um we understand you know
like if you go out on Mission with
multiple characters or multiple players
you want to be able to actually uh um be
able to go through and say Hey you know
I will give you a cut of this and right
now uh we know you can't do that but the
plan is is part of the service Beacon
designed whether or not that is the the
first tier that rolls out that's that's
something that um basically Tony and I
are still discussing uh what about plans
for a traditional like trade window like
like we see MMOs all the time you go to
another character you click on them you
go trade it opens up a window you type
money in you give people charact you
give people money that is basically via
mob glass and that that is that is kind
of the service Beacon design of you know
hey with the Mobi glass this is this is
how I um basically uh create contracts
so on and so forth we call it a service
Beacon but it's it's part of the Mobi
glass and and how that would work where
um it's player initiated contracts so if
you um are a hauler and you want to hire
a bunch of Merks or if you're a pirate
and you want to be able to pay you know
basically people for a day's work you
know that's that's what we'll we'll be
working towards all right cool well
that's all I got for you thank you so
much all right thanks sure we'll see if
I don't call you next week okay take
care bye all right well next question on
the list uh remember these questions
were are submitted entirely by you the
Star Citizen backer and voted on on
Spectrum uh the next third most voted
question that I think I can actually you
know call and reach a person for uh I
think is perfect for Jeffrey so let's go
ahead and see if he
answers Jeffrey how you doing man hello
what's up not much uh we don't get a lot
of chance to talk is this our is this
our first Skype call that we've ever had
I think so yeah like we've met in we've
met in person a few times but we I don't
think we ever talked on Skype we've been
in person we've been on like sync calls
when like we're releasing patches like
when we're all listening and we've been
on Skype calls but I don't think we've
ever been in a Wonder Walk call how you
doing doing all right it's kind of cold
in Austin right now yeah I no not as not
as cold as it was in
Arkansas so I know you are of course
bearded cig here at here at cloud and
PRI games and I'm I'm sitting here I'm
watching you and I just instinctively
was rubbing my face here going going you
know I'm like hey you're not going to
say I miss my beard but but I don't miss
my beard I do get questions from
co-workers asking how I managed to eat
with my mustache in my face I I swear to
God I've got a hairball in my lower
intestine I have to it's going to be
there for the next 3 months
all right we've wasted enough time on
chitchat uh the next question I have
from you uh from our backers it says
will we will we see hot fixes between
3.0 and 3.1 and
3.2 okay uh to answer that question
probably the first thing we need to do
is establish what we consider a hot fix
because different software companies and
even different video game companies have
different definitions for what hot
fixes okay for cig typic we consider the
term hot fix to be for something that we
apply to an environment that's already
been deployed but where the fix isn't
something that's normally included that
for the build that the environment's
hosting so like in a worst case scenario
if we were to redeploy the exact same
change list that our backers can see in
the launcher for the version of the game
those fixes wouldn't be included for a
redeployed version of that game because
they were added after the fact okay what
this tends to mean is that the fixes can
go into the game without players
actually noticing that they've been
added unless we specifically tell them
uh to answer the question as to whether
we will see any hot fixes the plain fact
is that we have already hot fixed a
number of problems that were encountered
over the holiday break Ahmed and Bryce
as well as Tony and some of our other
engineers and programmers were looking
into several issues that were happening
with with the diffusion Gateway and our
shopping system and the probability
volume service because we had a bunch of
problems where Game servers weren't
recovering their ability to list items
in the shops we had a b a problem where
the probability volume service was
spawning a mission that was causing the
game servers to deadlock uh we had a
really strange issue where the game
servers were causing ships to become
parents and children of other ships
which caused the circular reference
and then tried CLE data because it was a
circular reference the would deadlock
because it would just keep going round
and round and round and round and uh I
remember I was I just I was just sitting
at home uh reading the Skype chat and
watching heing the logs and part seeing
what I what I can of that stuff and just
going what the heck it's like an oral
boros um and
then uh another one actually some of the
hot fixes for the the persistence cach
that we did were to put in additional
logging so that we could figure out what
was causing it to deadlock and then Tom
Sawyer ended up figuring out that the
deadlock was being caused by that
cyclical reference and then we also did
a hot fix to the general instance
manager because I discovered that it was
trying to matchmake people into matches
that weren't supposed to let people in
once they had already started so like
for Vandal swarm
and uh pirat swarm and race modes once
the game mode start people can't join
but it was still trying to put them in
and then it was telling them you can't
join that because it's already started
so another one of the hot fixes we put
in was to make it so that the gym would
stop doing that and uh we also have this
new feature for 3o for the backend
Services where we have a dedicated
process that will take all of the items
that people have purchased on our
platform mhm and add them to their
account in game originally the servers
that would do that would be the same
servers players were on and if one of
those servers crashed it could cause
problems with items being missing and
stuff so now we have a dedicated process
for
that that because it's not shared with
instances that players are playing on we
don't have to worry about it crashing
and in the middle of someone getting the
items added to their account right one
of the gem hot fixes we added was to
exclude those specific processes to
Rolling restarts that we can do to the
game ser
servers uh I think that covered most if
not all of the hot fixes we did so if I
understand you correctly uh the question
was will we see hot fixes uh yeah I
think there's a misnomer there it goes
there will be plenty there have been
plenty of hot fixes and there may even
be more hot fixes in the future but you
may not necessarily see them am I right
yeah yeah it it it we we don't have to
send down a patch for a hot yeah it's
it's not always something that people
are going to notice unless we make sure
that we're communicating to them that
they're happening kind of like how we
are doing in this video I wonder
why what what it's like there's there's
a plan behind everything all right Jeff
well thank you so much I'll let you get
back to work thank you all right bye
bye okay so Jeffrey PR out of uh out of
uh Austin our first Skype call our first
one-on-one Skype call we've ever had
we've worked here for years uh so next
question uh it's a ship question now we
do have a ship a show for ships it's
called ship shape but uh uh this is your
question you guys submitted it you guys
voted it up so I have a person here in
Los Angeles yes there's construction
going on uh that I think is going to be
perfect for us so let's see if he picks
up here Kirk Kirk to how you doing man
oh hey Jared what's up not much uh so
you remember I came by your desk earlier
today and I told you about calling all
devs and I said I'd be calling you we
arrang this yeah uhhuh you got time for
me now uh yeah we do sure I do all right
so I got a question it's from backers
it's voted on by backers it was one of
the most voted on uh questions in the in
the first uh couple days here uh put
simply what is that construction noise
no hold on all right here we go what is
the plan for our freelancer
variant ah the freelancer um okay well
uh it it is one of the original uh five
ships uh fourar citizen that were
planned um and we do know that backer
has been waiting for them uh for them
and so for that we do apologize um I do
know that they're currently uh scheduled
to Begin work uh in the latter half of
the year um by the uh UK team um this um
doesn't guarantee that uh they'll be
done by the by the end of the year but
uh we are striving to to make that
happen um and um we do we do know how
much the um uh the community has been
climing for them so uh we we are working
on them and we uh do fund it to uh get
get them started and we'll try to get
them completed um unfortunately as you
know um we do have a lot of ships that
we're uh making and a lot of features
that need to go in the game um that also
require artists and design and
Engineering work and so things do get
pushed back uh but um but they're on the
schedule so uh we'll we'll try to get
them out uh by by the end of this year
um also uh some a bit of other news the
300 series wework uh is also on the
schedu for this year and uh that will be
done by the team here in la la so um
we'll um we'll be working on it here
locally awesome man thank you so much
cool I'll let you get back to work all
right bye all right
bye and so for our final call for this
we this week's calling all devs um one
of my favorite people he doesn't know
he's one of my favorite people he's one
of my favorite people uh mostly because
I well I'll tell you about it later
we're going to give Luke Presley a call
and uh see if he picks up bus man there
Luke how you doing man hi jar how are
you good thank you for picking up and
answering my call no is right what time
is it there it is five o'clock gotcha
when I did the first episode I did all
La people that kind of keep it you know
easy on me and this episode is almost
entirely UK and uh Austin and uh
Frankfurt people so so I've had I'm up
really early in the morning right now
but it's okay thank you so much uh we've
got a question for you for calling all
devs the last question of the show and
these are questions submitted by backers
of course and voted on on Spectrum M so
uh the question that I have for you here
is is the current way we spawn ships and
vehicles in game the final
implementation I you know using a
terminal and popping them in or are
there plans for further development of
this feature down the
road um there are definitely further
plans for development um so the terminal
probably like the notion of going to a
terminal probably won't change um the
terminal will definitely change I mean
the the UI on there will get major
improvements um and the the kind of flow
of it but as for like popping in and out
I guess the reason you're seen so much
popping in and out is
because um places like osur um and Grim
hex that only has the landing pads right
now doesn't have the hangers um uh I
mean you see these things popping out on
those Landing pads it should be a
hanger osar is a legacy kind of thing we
just build on and build on until we
finally get like the truck stop and you
know we we'll get a a final Hotel
eventually and it'll have some hangers
and that means that all of this popping
in and out will happen away from the
player you know he won't be able to go
in that hanger before he's ask for the
ship and then he'll be granted access to
the hanger and he'll go in now that's
not to say that we can ever completely
get rid of popping in and out um I mean
for instance when a player logs out you
know his ship hangs around for an amount
of time and then it has to go somewhere
um and a player logging in obviously
that that ship has to come in some you
know where he parked it before if he
left it you know off on a um not stored
yeah yeah exactly so I don't think we'll
get rid of it entirely we are a game
after all but
you know you won't be seeing them
popping in and out on the landing pads
as often as you do now got you that's a
Hallmark of every you know Chris Roberts
game that that that that uh uh that um
what's the diagetic you Universe we we
we we we want to try to make uh uh star
seison appear as much as how it would
appear in the real world so I I this was
the first time I've heard that idea so I
love the idea So eventually you're
saying that the version of Port allar we
have is not the final version definitely
definitely art is a monstrosity I mean
you're about to see something it's about
to get even worse because you know the
reclaimer is is huge it's it's almost
the size of Idis and uh that's coming
soon so we've had to just the the large
landing pad that is already like a
football field is now going to be like
two football fields um on on there so I
mean it's good because we we don't we
don't waste like final art or anything
like that we just you know expand upon
th this thing until we've got until we
know all the things that it needs to do
um and then and then once we've got that
we can build this thing properly knowing
all the the pieces very cool very cool
that I'm I'm excited I'm excited uh
thank you so much Luke we'll let you go
thank okay all right thanks man to work
bye bye so uh Luke Presley one of my
favorite people um about two years ago
when I came back from Gamescom I swung
by UK and met with Luke crley and I
pitched him my ideas for for for two
different uh uh quests or missions or
things in the persistent universe and uh
one of them uh he said was well he was
very kind about it and like shoed me off
it was about finding my missing Keys the
other one though was essentially what
became uh Benny's henge it was basically
a storyline uh to find out who was
stealing all the big Benny machines in
the persistent universe and and and he
came up with Benny henge and whatnot so
uh so that's why luk Presley is one of
my favorite people and that does it for
this week's episode of calling all devs
uh hope you enjoyed it remember there's
a thread on Spectrum that's where we got
all five of our questions this week uh
you can submit your questions and most
importantly don't forget to vote on
which questions you want to see uh asked
each and every week so for calling all
devs I'm Community content manager Jared
