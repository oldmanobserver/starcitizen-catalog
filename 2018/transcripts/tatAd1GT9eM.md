hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse
I'm sandy gardner and i'm chris roberts
this week we're checking in with nick
Helms and various development teams for
another squadron 42 project update yeah
we're gonna take a look at some key tech
and assets being built out for the game
take it away Nick hi everyone welcome to
another squadron 42 project update as we
get closer to our target goals for the
game it becomes harder and harder to
show you what we've completed without
revealing key parts of the story this
month we will attempt to give you a
glimpse of our progress without
revealing any spoilers go to join us
lieutenant for squadron 42 we have a
number of feature teams which work on a
variety of aspects of the gameplay the
technology that we need to develop the
game everything from the content side of
things through to in development
technology and technology that doesn't
exist yet you know when you put these
disciplines together and you put these
teams together and they sat down on the
same floor the knowledge that they share
have a speed at which these people can
work together it's remarkably better in
a lot of places you still have you know
an engineering team and then they sit
together on their own separate to the
animation team or separate to the design
team and you know while that method of
development can work it's a lot slower
and it's also a lot less involved as
well but if you have a feature team if
you have this dedicated strike team and
you have a member from each of those
disciplines together then you know you
bring those features to completion
together combat as always has been a
strong focus for our feature teams
this month we've been working on
mobility and actions like vaulting
jumping and climbing to make sure that
shooting and exploration are fluid and
fun so something we do in game at the
moment is that we we have two different
types of animations we have entity
driven animations and we have animation
driven animations we've kind of mixed
these up in the past and we're really
shooting for entity driven animation now
where the player is in full control of
what they're doing when they stop
pressing you know if they stop pressing
forward they stop immediately if they
start pressing a button they start
immediately so we want the player to
feel like they're in full control of
everything
Kanaks like vaulting and jumping
mantling things like that are kind of
movement mechanics that we have had work
on but we've not had time to fully
finish out yet so we wanted to revisit
all of that make sure we've got all
finished assets it feels good from the
first-person perspective and it still
looks really good in third as well the
actor team have been refining the idle
system for NPCs this makes sure that
they automatically pick the most
suitable idle animation for their
current situation and environment the
main idea is that no matter what
situation a character is in as soon as
they have no instructions from the
behavior the idle system will take over
and we'll play appropriate animation
idle animation or fidget for this given
context we change the set up in a way
that now it's the idle poses are bound
together with the animation and it's all
set up in mannequin this makes it much
easier for the designers in
conversations previously designers were
the people who need it to specifically
request every single idle animations now
they don't need to worry about any idle
poses that they only need to request the
animations and conversation lines they
need and this system which is like kind
of running underneath will take care of
this the engineering team have also been
working on our procedural inverse
kinematic tech with the goal being to
smooth out blending by retaining as much
of the actors performance as possible
procedural solutions we've been talking
about is the ways we use the game code
to change the animated poses some of the
things we've been working on really is
to procedurally blend between a lot of
different grip poses to get to shape on
the hands we want to better connect with
items you're holding depending on where
you hold them and the size of the item
we also use AI K to solve different
constraints we want to keep so if we
want the hand to be in a certain
position but without the spine to deform
and use the entire length of the arm one
thing we've been looking at is a unique
ok solver specifically to improve and
look at the arm to let more of the
animation be there even though we're
using I Kate to move the hand to better
fit with
the object doing interacting with
problems specifically bit like a solver
is is you could solve a few cases and
then you get this one edge case that
just flips their whole thing out it's
just a lot of maths involved we're
really happy with the progress we were
making I mean a lot of the things we've
kind of worked out in theory because a
lot of procedural things you kind of go
like oh this could bug procedurally
house actually sort of panned out in
game the actor feature team has made a
lot of progress this month the player is
now able to examine objects and
manipulate them with their hands to find
out new information another thing that
we have been working on that we want to
be able to do with items is inspect them
so it's a nice take that we've added the
ability to be able to bring them up into
central view and then use the mouse to
manipulate them so you can kind of look
around them and what that allows us to
do is allows the player to do should I
say this focus on attachment ports to be
able to in the future will be able to
interact with those swap out different
attachments like scopes and that kind of
thing so the main focus of the past
couple of Sprint's has been a lot of
visual refinement so polishing
animations that kind of thing making
everything look better when you picking
things up placing down and also
obviously adding in this solvent inspect
stay and all these different grips so
the amount of things that you can pick
up and interact with in the environment
it's kind of just expanded just
increasing the emotional so everything's
looking yeah prettier the weapons team
are starting to bring some of the tech
previously seen in the alien ships to
their weapons the giant rocket launcher
is one of the first weapons out of the
blocks and is shaping up nicely so this
is the Xen carrouges rocket launcher
that is part of squadron 42 it was
really interesting to work on it since
it was the first alien weapon we've been
working on and it was definitely
something new for us I was responsible
for the in-game model texturing and
shaders we added an animated glow effect
C&D codes and made an overall polish
pass to it so all materials textures and
animations were fine-tuned we try to
make the weapon look really heavy and it
will be about the same size as the
railgun the VFX team have been
prototyping procedural soft-bodied
formation to create amazing destruction
assets impressively this is accomplished
with much less art resource than usual
this month we've worked out how to do
take a standard wall assets break it up
and do apply a soft body simulation to
it and then rig it for games so we can
do deformation and light shearing of
metal in game this method will be used
for the cinematic sequences where you
see either a ship Bend or crumple or a
piece of metal work such as a metal wall
shear and break apart this method is
like a cheaper method of doing this
bending process
we have another method for doing this
which is the GM cash Alembic way but
that is a lot more expensive there's a
lot more memory resources that is used
there so in conjunction with that and
this method here we can blend these two
together to make very interesting and
detailed destruction simulations it's
not often that we get to associate a
team's work with the word rubbish but
this month we've seen the props team
deliver loads of detail work on the
clutter and scrap that's built around
the various abandoned spaces in the
verse recently I've been working on
scrap piles and these have been using a
mix of a substance designer and ZBrush
pipeline they make use of several
techniques one of which is using silent
textures and the other one is using
unique props I start by sculpting assets
inside of that brush which are then
taken into designer and sputtered around
and distributed in a procedural manner
and this works well from both an
artistic and a production standpoint
this has been a quite an interesting set
to work on it's been a mix of location
work and regular props work this asset
type has blended in with both props and
environment type work and this works
well from both an artistic and a
production standpoint
the Vandal race continues to get there
look animation and behavior fleshed out
focus this month has been on their basic
costumes and primary weapons we're
working on the vanduul armors we're
tying in there look a lot with the ships
and we're also gonna see their culture
kind of combined with a couple other
cultures because the kovanda like to
kind of bring in influences from other
cultures but they still have a really
unique look we're also working on the
weapons Evangel don't use traditional
weapons they don't use rifles and stuff
the main thing that we're focusing on
having them uses a spear so they have a
spear that which has multiple different
types of States in it a firing state a
collapse state they also have a very
close quarters knife the knife actually
plays pretty tightly into the lore of
the vanduul because it kind of ties who
they are as a species you know we're
working on different types of things I'm
really just fleshing out the culture of
the vanduul as a whole that's all for
this month's update until next time back
to you so any increase thanks everyone
in stars that are the news the live
release of Alpha 3.2 is right around the
corner yes that's right
and thanks to all our PT groups for
continuing to get a patch ready for
prime time with the all new mining
mechanic new weapons and various quality
of life improvements you're definitely
gonna want to jump into the PU and check
out what three points you has to offer
there will also be newly flyable ships
of course the AG is eclipse vandal blade
argent 600 i and the anvil hurricane
will soon be flyable in-game yes as well
as the totally redesigned the geo serve
ng line which joins the fireball roster
with this release and with the Debu of
mining in 3.2 the prospector has returns
in the pledge saw those of you that
pledge for the drake vulture will also
get the prospector as a loaner ship or
you can use a newly implemented group
system to find a friend with a
prospector and convince them to lend it
to you or that checkout reverse vers
live on twitch tomorrow for our monthly
subscriber townhall episode and maybe a
special appearance by chris is that
treat you well you're just gonna have to
chant in to find out thanks to all our
subscribers response for the choice and
thank you to all of our backers for your
continued support and enthusiasm we hope
you're excited for alpha 3.2 until next
week
we will see
around the around the mos restart that's
