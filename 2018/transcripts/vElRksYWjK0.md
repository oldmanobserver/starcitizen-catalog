everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host Mark Abbott let's get
smashing hey everyone we're here in my
fun little test mark level and I'm gonna
hop right in spawn into my fun little
Gladius go to third person because I
have well Alexia my ship and we're
looking at a bug with the landing gear
today specifically when if you open and
close them a few times they just stopped
working it takes a little bit for it to
happen about two or three tries as it
opened and closed we are going to look
at the debug output of the landing gear
to see what's going on so here we have
the Gladius and this shows all the
information from mannequin and you'll
see landing gear letting your front
letting your left letting go right and
the green little letters that say
planning your compress the landing gear
is out right now so it's playing the
compress animation so when I hit the
surface it will react to the ground and
go up and down and if I deploy you'll
see that it plays a bunch of animation
and sounds indicate it's deploying and
retracting so it looks like it's working
correctly from here and still deploying
cool still not broken let's see if this
breaks it ah we broke it so now it's
trying to extend as you can see and it
snapped and then it and the animations
is all sorts of funky right now and of
course we have the broken state well
unfortunately mannequin is indicating
that some it's trying to do it which
means this is happening at a deeper
level mannequin is on so you have the
game code side then you have mannequin
and then you've got to go one higher
which is the animation
system so I'm going to turn off the
mannequin debug and I have another C of
R here that allows us display all the
animations presently playing and very
back in the animation system and as you
can see here all in pink there's like
the first few floors should say number
the first three up in here have one two
three four five six seven animations on
each of them so each of the landing gear
trying to play seven animations and what
this tells me is the animations are
never getting cleared from the animation
system which is a huge problem so if I
pop back in spawn to a lettuce you'll
see that all three landing gears on the
top are playing landing gear extracted
animation as soon as I opened it up it
should have cleared that old extended
one and it's playing another one so the
animations are playing on top of each
other and that's why we're seeing the
snap because eventually they build up
and build up and it can't overcome and
they kind of override each other and
things just go mayhem
so let's pop into the code so here's our
landing system this is the game code
representation of opening and extracting
and unfortunately the bug isn't
happening in here but this was the first
point of contact to see what's happening
and the landing gear the way that
they're devised is you have the ship and
the landing gear underneath it so we
process our animations we go ship level
then the detachments which is the
landing gear and so when our ship wants
to process the attachments the landing
gear will call this bit of code right in
this section to finish its animation so
the vehicle will animate then a landing
it will animate so if I put a breakpoint
right here don't hop back into the game
spawn to Gladius we're gonna hit this a
few times let me disable it
hmm go back to awesome third person and
now I'm going to put a breakpoint back
in here now what's supposed to happen in
here is the landing gear will come in
here it will finish off the animations
and then call this finished animation
computation which should then run a
bunch of information in here to sync the
physics of the landing gear up and to
basically clear out all the old
animations that were getting hit so
we're gonna get called a few times so
let's do something interesting we're
gonna put a breakpoint right here
breakpoints are awesome because I have a
suspicion when we get into here our
landing gear isn't clearing the
animation and because of that it must
not be getting past this point hence I'm
gonna install a debug break to get this
reaction to see what's happening let's
let recode continue on so I added that
debug break and as you can see my
suspicion was true we're hitting this
almost immediately and the landing gear
just started coming up so what is
happening here obviously our animation
got told it was done before we could
even finish because let me close this
this parts not supposed to occur until
we finish this bit and we're obviously
getting out a little bit early now if we
go back to this process attachment
you'll notice here when we call finished
computation we actually go into here we
actually called the second bit and this
gets set where are you
did you so this gets set when we first
start the animation so here it is so if
we wanted to play the deploy we'll say
that we're going to start up which means
when we got to here something has told
to end now during normal passes of
operation this will this call right here
will finish the animation at which point
to do where are you
it will synchronize the thread finish
off and then say it was done which means
that go back go back go back
gotta go back back which means we have
finished before we even finished if we
go back into the process attachment
you'll notice here there's a bunch of
code that kind of does some extra bit of
work that's not necessary
so all this bit right here is trying to
finish the animation thread and then get
into a state where it's done however
it's unnecessary because that's exactly
what this guy is doing so we're
essentially doing the pre-work before
the actual animation stuff is able to
finish it's some leftover code from back
in the day before we you know we
optimized all of this section so the
reality is and the fun part of this is
to basically go well we don't need this
anymore because finished animation
computation we'll do it all in here
we're going to synchronize the animation
hookup all the bone positions and then
say that we're done so and the character
process attachment we just let it do its
job and I'm gonna recode and to recap
the vehicle will animate it will tell
all of its children including the
landing gear to also animate it'll go
into this process attachment once the
animation is done it's supposed to
finish call this finished animation
computation which cleans up all the
animation backend stuff to make sure the
threads are synched up and the animation
is well completed unfortunately we had
some leftover code from back in the day
which did that
top of the new way and so we finished
all the animation computation did all
the bones and all that stuff movements
and then when we got into the actual new
way of doing it where we need to finish
off the enemy computation then clear off
the existing animations it would never
get here and of course the easiest way
is just remove the old way let the new
way happen hit recode and see what
happens so let's see what happens all
right we're back in the game I'm going
to refresh a new ship baby my infamous
fun Gladius and now when we open into
play it's playing the extended animation
which is good and the extent is gone and
that we have just the compress let's go
back and it there so now all of these
sub attachments we'll make sure to clear
all the animations and everything is
good hope you guys enjoyed as you guys
saw we had a fun little issue with the
animations just never getting cleared
from the landing gear and as a result
when we try to push new ones on there it
just wouldn't happen and then our
landing gear we get stuck and all hell
would break loose well we had to make
sure that all the animations got away
and then everything was good to go I
hope you guys enjoyed until next time
you
