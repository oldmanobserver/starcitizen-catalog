everybody and welcome to another edition
of calling all deaths the only weekly
Q&A show where you get me asking
questions that you guys submit you guys
vote on putting them to the developers
it's our new thing on Mondays with is
our fourth or fifth episode now I'm
losing track let's just get right to it
shall we
alright so starting off the show this
week a question that I think is on a lot
of people's minds I know just the person
to call for it it's chad mckinney here
in our lawson studio Chad Chad how you
doing man hey well welcome to calling
all Deb's is your first time on the show
yeah I'm excited
alright so I've got a question I've got
a question for you that uh it's on
everybody's people have been I don't
needs no introduction
what is golf citizen where's golf ball
citizen is ping-pong citizen what's
going on here well it's a it's an
entertaining bug that's happening the
root of the issue is that the persistent
data precision loadout for players
getting wiped out and effectively the
body is getting detached and when that
happens you end up spawning as little
white golf ball bounced around I this is
not the first time it's happened but it
does surface from time to time of
similar root issues and in this
particular case it got out in 3.0 it's
sort of happening to a lot of people and
we weren't entirely sure what was
causing it this time after some
investigation from QA and from our live
ups guys looks like they got a solid
repo from it which is in a heavy server
making changes in the personal manager
app was ending up sending incomplete or
missing data to the persistence database
which was causing this kind of
corruption cause you just spawn as a
white bulb this is one of those
situations where
I mean obviously we did a ton of QA and
and bug-fixing and before we went out
and we just didn't see this like at all
we didn't see it at all I fixed a lot of
persistent bugs and this was not one of
them that even came in and the issue is
that the the reason why I was showing up
in live and not for us is because of the
much heavier traffic performance issues
at scale and so we were able to find
thankfully again with some hard work
ways some reliable reaper steps and they
were able to reproduce it by having
people on the server and then also
making some fast swapping between in and
out of moby glass applying changes in
PMA and we were able to cut out doing
doing this look at a whirling dervish
act you could eventually arrive at this
white bowl now you said it you said it
wasn't seen in evocati it was seen
evocati but too infrequently first find
that the source for it this is one of
those things one of those great moments
where it's always important to remember
that every star citizen environment
whether it's the evocati or the PTU or
even our live alpha environment is still
a testing environment they're all
testing and people like why did you push
three points good because some things we
knew we wouldn't be able to track down
until we got this out to as many people
as humanly possible and it wasn't until
we got it out to everybody and started
seeing that the hammering that could
only occur when everybody is in there
that we were able to actually track this
down soon now so now we had the repro do
we have a fix for it it's a little it's
a little bit up in there actually we put
in an initial fix for it that tried to
prevent the PMA from making alterations
when it's in this uncertain state
effectively the PMA operates using a lot
of asynchronous operations we need to
make requests to the server to get the
current persistent load out of the
player and all of the items that could
potentially go in and give an item
or I Edition aliy there's many chains of
asynchronicity in the code itself so you
have the flash on the front and but then
that needs to talk to something in code
and so we have the flash which talks to
something all the contacts component via
events and then itself fires events to
something called provide our component
which then coordinates using a bunch of
remote methods just in requests to the
server and then we get responses and we
change back and forth so there's a lot
of opportunities for when you have these
kind of like timing operations for
things to go awry and so clearly we were
playing a little bit fast and loose in
in this particular scenario and we tried
a couple solutions to try to make a
small change to fix the problem you know
this 3.0 is out we don't want to make
some large change to the code to try to
fix this bug and then introduce four or
five more so you know we tried small
changes to fix it in it started to fix
it but you could still get it to happen
with a little bit more dedication and
then QA was yet again able to find a
more reliable sort of repros because
they were looking at it longer and this
even led to finding some other bugs that
we didn't even know were there like
spotting small ships in the actual game
but we won't get into that
so anyways long story short we end up
too late yeah long story long we ended
up doing a few more kind of more
comprehensive set of fixes I helped a
bit but a lot of it was spearheaded by
the you I get UI guys and the UK and
effectively the there's a few set of
changes the probably fix it which is
don't make changes to persistent data
when you know you shouldn't be so if you
haven't actually change anything don't
allow a save don't allow saving data and
you're still waiting on something finish
so if you've made a request for some
data you haven't gotten a response don't
save the data and also prevent immediate
transformation of the data so the first
when you ever you up the screen or if
you've made a change you don't you
shouldn't be able to like the next frame
again apply a change to that so
basically it's reducing all these
opportunities for I in incoherent data
to make its way and when you know things
are still in motion and it looks like
that we've got mostly a fix in I need to
look at my email and see what QA is
saying right now
yeah this is a fix that's currently in
testing in a three point zero point one
patch that's with evocati right now so
so wit so we are currently testing
potential fixes and we rolled out one
version of 301 we're getting ready to
roll out another version 301 soon by the
time this airs we'll probably have done
one maybe even two more I've helped with
a lot of other three one patches as well
and this is kind of the last one that's
that's won't died but I think maybe
we've got the bullet for now yeah it
will die it just hasn't died yet so
alright Chad thank you so much I'll let
you get back to work thank you it's
talking to you funny
alright so up next I've got a question
about ship interior customization that I
think it's perfect for Matt Sherman's
let's see if Matt picks up here Matt how
you doing it
yep hey Jared how's it going good you
have a new desk yeah yeah so now we can
also intrude on the world of John Chimel
whenever you call me yeah I'm sorry I
have to do that I do the tours here in
the LA studio it's like I'm dreading the
first tour because I don't know where
anybody is
hi so I've got a question for you
it's about ship interior customization
basically this question from spectrum
voted on by the backers they want to
know what our plans if any are to
customize the in decorate the interior
of our ships now of course this was one
of our original stretch goals from way
back in the day so yeah have we done
anything with that have we made any
movement on it not now a lot of you know
active progress it's definitely
something that we're keeping in mind
it's something that we definitely wanted
delivers some fun options and choices
for people to make but you
in the reality of things it's just
getting more ships out is the the bigger
priority versus getting these little
tchotchkes in but we've definitely got a
few lists of different you know kind of
dashboard decoration so most where it's
like yeah I know because one of the old
stretch gold ones was a bobble head of
some sort that everyone wants to see so
it's like okay not not just a bobble
head but it's like well what if it just
takes general physics yeah yeah
does it can it shake with your ship what
are the kind of weird little things
where it's like you know the the
pendulum swings what not so there's
definitely a lot of stuff that we want
to explore and it's just it's in its
holding pattern right now waiting for
that right time to really build
everything out and then start getting
all that integrated into the game I
remember a couple months and I guess you
you were you were going around the whole
office and asked people what would you
like to see in your in your spaceships
or just just taking ideas yeah yeah so
so it's it's it's and this has come up a
couple times I know some some of the
guys on the flare team in Austin have
asked questions about you know internal
ship decorations like that so so it's
definitely something that's on our minds
it's just obviously one of the biggest
aspects of game development is
prioritization so yeah it's something we
definitely want to get you it's just
maybe it's we don't know if it's time is
down just yet yeah because also once we
frame some of that time and we really
start diving into this it's getting a
lot of that other work out of the way
first is gonna last really dive into it
so instead of just mean like oh we've
made a bobble head or something it's
like oh no we've got a whole run of
bobble heads we've got all these other
little tchotchkes you know bring your
fan back and attach it to your the
sidewall of your ship or whatever so
just an idea countless people he's not
committing to it hey no we did bring the
fan back the fan is on the pilot seat of
the Cutlass it's just an integrated
little box fan now and not like a have
to punch the window to make it work for
my fan and hashtag not my fan wow I've
just hashtag me god
I think you should do bobbleheads
don't you think bigger I think
bobbleheads would be a great idea Chris
Jared thinks bobbleheads would be a
great idea yeah Jared's really smart
we also think bobbleheads would be fun
it's just when to make them you're my
favorite person here Jared no thank you
oh now we know it's a fake thing alright
thank you so much for your time man sure
thing
alright bye bye alright so our next
question our next question it's about
API I think I know who we can call here
we've got Paul Rand owned our Los
Angeles office who might know about this
hey Paul how you doing hey nice to meet
you we hang out all the time don't we
all right no we don't humans killed me
and started a star marina match like
over and over and over again that's my
relationship with Paul back in the big
way way way back in the day
alright so Paul I got a question for you
for you from the backers it's about API
they say can we get an API that will
display data from external apps in the
mobi glass or maybe even take
information from the mobi glass like
inventory like player inventory and
whatnot and send it out to websites what
are our thoughts on that API okay we
have definitely plans for an API not so
much from lobby glass it will be more an
API to our like inventory data but I
think that's exactly what you want
basically giving what ships you own what
items you have all those kind of things
we don't work on that API yet because
the systems are still very much like
changing and like writing an API for
data which is likely to change it's like
not they're not the most optimal way to
do it the other way around we are
looking into ways to integrate spectrum
into the game so a lot of features you
can have on spectrum we try to want to
get into the game which could part of a
MOBA class or part of the on-screen chat
and so on so that rizzo sounds like we
just need further development on the
game itself and the UI itself and how
things work in the game before we start
building tools
for our backers do you have some
information for all right cool I'll let
you get back to work man thank you so
much
bye it's the next question we have a
leaf blower in the background one of you
guys can hear that next question is for
John Crew he is our lead technical
designer out of a foundry 42 UK John
John I love it hey thanks for thanks for
taking the comment that's okay
I see I expected to call you like every
single week when we started this show
and it turns out that's been poor Luke
Presley we've been calling with Presley
every single week yeah she's been hiding
so I've got a question for you this is a
very long a very detailed question it's
one that comes up quite a bit let me see
if I can let me see if I can I can
narrow this down here make this this
thing because this is a redeemer good
question redeemer question mark yeah
to be honest it's it's not really a
priority for us this year we know it's a
super-popular ship obviously came out of
the next great star ship big fan
favorite but it's it's not where we need
it to be I has a lot of design problems
and it's sort of it's not needed in the
PD issue it's not needed in the squadron
this year we have ships that that we
need more coming and it's prioritize
appropriately we know what we want to do
with it just to quickly go over
something like the design issues with it
like there's there's the mystery ghost
train turret where you sit in the seat
and you go outside into space to get
into the turret it's got it's a drop
ship that holds six people which is not
particularly fantastic it's got lots of
tight twisty spaces that just aren't too
metric so bringing all that together is
is a fairly hefty rework and we sort of
got two ideas internally where we want
to go with it
one is the pure gunship route that it
it's sort of half a gunship half a
dropship as it is and basically where
we're looking at those two avenues of
just going
gunship full dropship at the moment
really leaning more towards the gunship
side we've got other drop ships that are
better drop ships than it but we don't
have that
ac-130 style gunship I think a lot of
people would like right now let's
clarify looking at is we explore lots of
ideas lots of conversation this we
consider it doesn't mean that's
necessarily what's going to happen the
decision has not been made to make it a
gunship the decision has not been made
to make it a solely a dropship it's one
of those things it's a conversation it
has to happen yes this was a ship that
was made by backers and like I said
outside of metrics not only now outside
of the metrics we had and then we've
changed the metrics since then so it
does need a lot of work and it will
there will be some changes to it when it
when it's time does come but it's just
bubbling away in the background okay
look looking at the ship schedule of
course we just published our public
roadmap recently I know not everything
is on there like the whole sea is
currently not on there whatnot but is
the Redeemer something we're considering
working on in 2018 I don't think it is
it's not to my knowledge but I'm not a
producer fair enough fair enough
well I I have talked to the producers
and it is not it is it is not a ship
that we believe that will be working on
in 2018 so so just want to put that out
there because I know there's a lot of
people who ask every single week you
know any information and redeem or any
information Redeemer there will be
information just not anytime soon no
sadly all right John thing a cracker
wings bad news this week well someone's
going to do it yeah someone does have to
do it and that is that is the
double-edged sword of a show like this
yeah so it will get you answers it won't
always be the answer that you're looking
for all right thank you so much John
I'll let you get back to work no problem
but all right so John crew out of the @f
Manchester United Kingdom in
redeemer question we get the redeemer
question that quite a bit alright so for
our next call we are going to I'm
getting a phone call I'm getting a call
no one expects the bearded Inquisition
[Laughter]
yep that's good hey I saw last week's
episode actually I think I've seen all
of them at this point but okay I wanted
to offer a brief correction it's really
easy to think that we do database wipes
because that's kind of how it behaves to
the end-user but we actually don't wipe
the database ever we have all of the
databases that we've ever used from the
start of the project
gotcha I'm sorry I wasn't expecting a
phone call you're referring to Benoit
last week when he was talking about
having the bass UEC set a set as the
equivalent of an au ec database for when
we wipe databases and you're saying that
we don't actually wipe them we just we
just move them off of the active
environment and store them for research
so they're technically all stored in the
same place but okay what ends up
happening is usually I'm the one that
ends up making a new database and then
when we launch a build we tell the
environment which database we want it to
use so if it's using a new one
obviously everyone starts fresh but we
still have all the old data just for
historical purposes and science guys as
well that's probably important when
figuring out things like the economy and
wonder how much people are making how
much people are spending and stuff like
that each day plus the number of
derelict ships that we have sitting
around because those are all still there
[Laughter]
okay well thank you for your
clarification nope
oh so that's a that's a that's a
stunning hat yeah actually wore this to
a vacation I didn't Alaska and a couple
of people took a picture with me because
they thought I was a local ok well
thanks for calling feel free to call
anytime in yeah will do thanks
up next we are returning to Manchester
United Kingdom with our first time three
timer mr. Luke Presley hey Luke how you
doing man I need everything I'm doing
you know it's me it's another day in
paradise
mm-hmm so this is getting pretty regular
the weather never changes here we had we
had a cloud the other day it was nice
which is we all went out to the parking
lot and just stood up and looked at the
cloud like but I've got a question for
you I'm pretty sure you know that you
know that you know this one's coming our
way we get this one a lot
I go to bar citizens and people are like
hey hey just go I'm like yeah I'm like
you're honest we went when the Redeemers
coming all right like when is Tess
Bester coming out well I'm just thought
it's not a ship question okay so yeah
your question your question from the
backers voted on the spectrum can we get
her back please without us she is all
alone out there they say yeah it was
actually pretty hard riffing her out
actually like she's offered our first
mission giver and yeah but I mean yeah
she's coming back
so yeah actually recorded her voice for
three Oh like ah because we had all the
actors in again we I mean it would have
been great to get her in for free oh but
we had so many other things to like we
had the miles Eckhardt
and ruto was even a stretch for free oh
and and we had we've got oh like in the
back pocket as it as it were through the
time I want to bring her back is when we
have the missions will do her justice
which is when we get scanning in because
she's the perfect mission giver for
scanning type missions and I know I do
know that the universe is a little more
hollow without her like okay honestly
like she
there's something about that actor and
the way that she was written that really
like just makes this like sparkle like
something about it so yeah don't worry
it she'll be coming back I do just want
to do her justice well I don't want to
bring her back to just have kind of the
same fetch missions that you've seen
already so who will appreciate that
thank you so much yeah you got anything
else no sorry don't know the secrets to
give alright well it's three times three
shows Oh we'll see it we'll see if we
can go in a week next week without
giving you a call but no promises no
well I'll see you next week and with
that we wrap up another episode of
calling all devs I hope you enjoyed it
don't forget that there are threads up
in the announcements section up on
spectrum where you can submit your
questions and most importantly vote it's
important that you guys vote on the
questions that you most want to see
answered each and every week I'll do my
best the best - fest I think my best to
find the developer most appropriate to
answering your questions so for calling
all devs I'm Content Manager for global
video production Jared Huckaby Ian Willa
we'll see you next week everybody
thank you for watching so if you want to
keep up with the latest and greatest in
star citizen the squadron 42 development
please follow us on our social media
channels see you soon
you
