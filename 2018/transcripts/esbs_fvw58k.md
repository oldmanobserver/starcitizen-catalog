Hello and welcome to another episode of
Around the Verse. I'm Sandi Gardiner.
And I'm Chris Roberts. Star Citizen
Alpha 3.1 went live last weekend with a
character customizer, service beacons,
improved UI, five new ships, 10 ship
weapons, and two new FPS weapons
officially entering the verse. Yeah,
that's quite a lot. And along with that,
we have improvements to frame rate and
visuals. So, if you haven't been to the
moons of Crusader recently, go check
them out.
Yes, go check them out. And a big thanks
to everyone in the community that helped
test 3.1 on the PTU, as well as all of
our incredibly hard working teams across
the globe who made the first quarterly
release of 2018 possible. Yes, a huge
thanks to all of you. And as we look
forward to the rest of the year,
starting with Alpha 3.2, we are taking
into account the background input
collected in the survey that went out
last week as we shuffle some things
around and continue to build out the
road map. We'll have a full road map
update soon, but this week we'll hear
from our studios in the UK.
Yes, also we'll see what the teams in
both Wilmslow and Derby have been
working on lately with Lux at involving
AI improvements, weapon tuning,
procedurally created space stations, and
more. After that, we'll get some insight
into the newest versions of the mobiGlas
feature, which continues to change and
improve along with Star Citizen itself.
But let's go to Ricky first for the UK
studio update.
Hi, and welcome to the UK studio update.
Starting with the environments team,
work has been underway on our next
generation of space stations beginning
with the rest stops. Rest stops are
unique among the space stations we've
designed so far as they are created
semi-procedurally.
This will allow us to populate the PU
with many variations of them easily. And
to do that, we put a lot of focus on
developing the right tools and workflow
needed to achieve it. There are three
main location components we've been
focusing on to achieve the first
iteration of the rest stop space
station. The first component is the
exterior. The unique silhouette of the
rest stop's exterior is designed to
maximize readability from a distance,
while also allowing for individual
personality and variety with the ability
to vary layout and architecture.
Varied building materials, color
schemes, and ad placement mean that a
great number of visual possibilities are
achievable throughout the modular
construction of these stations, which
allows us to automate layout generation
while maintaining artistic control.
Hangers have also undergone plenty of
recent development work. The rest stop
will be the first station type to fully
utilize this type of hanger, which we
are terming a common element, and can be
used in every utilitarian hanger in the
game.
Even though every hanger of this type
will share the same core design
functionality, they are built to allow
for mixing and matching of walls,
entrances, exits, and service modules in
a variety of ways and styles to achieve
varied looks across different locations.
The third location component we've been
focusing on is the interior. Developing
the procedural layout tool used to
generate these rest stops has been a big
and admittedly challenging project. We
are now at a stage where we can
automatically generate large numbers of
layouts using the tool and a set library
of room and connector prefabs.
Maintaining visual consistency and
coherence while still making locations
appear different remain artistically
challenging for the tool and the team.
Much like the exterior component, the
trick is to randomize a lot of smaller
choices like prop placement and lighting
rather than alter the larger room forms.
This method allows us to maintain
artistic control over the main spaces,
flow, and form.
Improvements have been made to the prop
team's entity system within DataForge,
allowing for one entity to contain both
gameplay features and visual keys while
being set up and controlled using one
system.
This means that once we set up an
entity, we can drop it into any level
retaining all working functionality.
This also makes for easier syncing
between animations and material effects
such as glows or UI elements.
Consequently, the number of lights
needed to fake glowing materials or
flashing lights during different stages
of animation has been significantly
reduced. We have revised our metrics and
template assets for useables and
interactive props, making them easier to
understand and allowing for improved
scalability and functionality support
for these item types.
Building on these tech improvements, we
are now able to create destructible
props that mesh swap and also update
environmental effects such as lights,
VFX, and audio accordingly.
These aren't being implemented in 3.1,
and we are still in the early stages,
but these tech developments are laying
the foundations for future releases.
A new set of low-tech medical props is
being built out along with some new
medical dressings. Both are planned for
use throughout the PU as common medical
elements.
We have also been working on the sub
items that will be used to customize the
performance of ship components and
making sure that when that feature comes
online, there is a wide selection of
visuals to support the gameplay.
The missions team has been replacing the
existing AI with new subsumption
behavior.
Still fairly early in its development,
we've been focusing on balancing and
implementing wild lines into the game
for the AI-controlled characters. For
those that might not know, wild lines
are lines of dialogue which play
systematically when the AI receives some
sort of trigger such as receiving
damage.
Okay, there's a favor and back.
These go a long way toward personalizing
each player's experience as the AI will
communicate with players differently
depending on their relationship and
history.
As the AI continues to develop, we've
also taken the opportunity to reassess
the Vanduul and Pirate Swarm game modes
within Arena Commander. They have been
rebalanced with the focus on delivering
a satisfying experience rather than
extreme difficulty.
Something we're really excited about is
the creation of a prototype scramble
race event which can work in space or
planet side.
In these death races, opponents battle
to collect randomly generated
checkpoints and more fundamentally to
stay alive.
The race relies heavily on dialogue, and
we have upcoming recording sessions
planned to supply this ahead of release.
Finally, we've been rebalancing the
reputation progression system as it
became apparent that there were too many
ways to accrue a negative reputation
while attaining a positive one was too
challenging. The UI team has been
researching ways to improve performance
by analyzing where the CPU is spending
its time.
Optimizations made to the code of the
ECG graph and the visor significantly
reduce the CPU cost without affecting
visual quality. The ECG graph has a
buffer for the heartbeat value. With
every update, the game would add a new
value to the front of the buffer while
removing the oldest from the back,
causing expensive memory shifting. To
prevent this, the team now uses a
circular buffer by just storing an index
to the oldest location in the buffer.
When the index reaches the end of the
buffer, it loops back to the start in
cyclical fashion, which is much more
efficient because memory is only written
to rather than being moved around. The
second optimization applied to the ECG
was to stop redrawing the whole graph
each frame. Instead, we add the new
value to the right-hand side and move
the whole graph along to the left.
We use a clip window to ensure only the
essential parts are drawn, and the
graphics data is recycled in a similar
fashion to the circular buffer.
The graphics team has been working on
some major performance savings when
rendering characters.
Each of our characters are split up into
many different meshes, not only for
swapping out clothing and armor, but
also so that we can hide individual
portions of an object to avoid
interpenetrating geometry. Our shaders,
textures, and geometry have now been
organized in such a way that we can
render multiple adjacent meshes in one
go, which vastly reduces the CPU cost of
submitting the work to the GPU while
maintaining flexibility. To improve the
quality and legibility of our various UI
screens, we've been working on two new
shader effects for the render to texture
system.
The first is an edge highlighting effect
which we use for the ship targeting
displays, and the second is a drop
shadow effect to help make sure icons
stand out against bright backgrounds.
Graphics has also been collaborating
with the VFX department to improve our
GPU particle system.
Our ambitious VFX artists are
implementing lean production techniques
to prioritize the features that will
provide maximum impact.
A couple of examples would be improved
spawn inheritance and curl noise, both
of which were requested to allow us to
create better, cheaper electrical and
plasma effects for things like the coil
interior and EMP weapon improvements.
They've also been working through a
fairly large snag list for the 3.1
release, doing things like toning down
the dust mote opacity in certain
environments that have undergone
lighting updates and re-adding planet
moon effects so they work correctly with
the planetary tech improvements.
Tech design has been finalizing 3.1
release work implementing and tuning new
weapons like the Gattsu ballistic
Gatling, P I R R distortion scattergun,
and A M R S laser cannon while
supporting the conversion of existing
gear to weapon 2.0. They also have been
re-balancing a lot including distortion
weaponry following fixes to allow items
to affect items as opposed to just
shields,
countermeasures to make them more
effective post item 2.0 implementation,
continued iteration of flight balance
especially atmospheric landing
turbulence, and the re-balance of shield
setback and regeneration rates.
At the other end of the pipeline,
they've also been working with art on
some exciting new ship concepts which
will be revealed throughout the year on
Around the Verse's ship shape segment.
Also contributing to the game's
ever-expanding fleet is ship art team.
The Aegis Hammerhead's interior is
mostly set out with the exception of the
crew dorm and kitchen area while the
cargo bay and bridge are currently in a
detailing pass.
Another Aegis ship, the Eclipse, is now
back in full production. The current
focus being the exterior.
The team is reinforcing its stealthy
appearance by tightening up the palm
panel line details, enhancing the
materials, and making sure all the
movement parts are operational.
The weapon audio system has undergone a
substantial refactor and work has begun
on designing full N L P C weapon
perspective sets along with specific
sounds for various distances.
An environmental weapon report or tail
layer has also been added for a weapons
on planet side location to better
reflect the environmental response of
the weapon fire.
Recently, members of the audio team took
part in a sound effects recording
session at Oscillate Studios focused on
vibrating various metallic objects using
transducers that respond to low
frequency sounds.
The metals were simulated via
synthesized tones which were performed
using a MIDI keyboard playing with the
pitch in order to impart different
resonances and sympathetic rattles to a
diverse range of scrap metal objects.
Jazz.
It's a bit like jazz.
The primary focus of the session was to
create source material for our ships
partly inspired by the sound production
team at Warner Brothers who worked on
the Christopher Nolan film Interstellar.
They used large scale subwoofers to
resonate the fuselages of aircrafts to
model the behavior of spaceships under
duress simulating atmospheric entry,
strong gravitational fields, and so on.
The Derby office continues to expand its
operations. It was a pleasure to welcome
a number of our valued backers during
the recent Imperator Subscribers event
where the developers demonstrated core
elements of their workflow including
facial animation, motion capture, and
technical animation.
The tour also offered us the opportunity
to scan three more faces and we look
forward to seeing the lucky participants
in the verse.
The gameplay story team have been
getting all the required scenes for
gameplay story organized in shotgun and
are working with the design to get the
first few scenes implemented in game and
up to standard. Progress has been made
on R&D for the Vandal face rig and
internal facial rig technologies along
with iterations to female rigs in Maya.
The new one-to-one conversion updates to
the rig will break a lot of animations
that use props so we've been developing
an automated solution to fix the
animation files we have without an
animator having to manually go through
and re-animate everything.
And finally, the facial animation team
has been busy finalizing animations on
various P U shopkeepers, bartenders, and
mission givers. You doing all right?
Everything good?
Make an uncertain world
a little more certain.
That's all I can say till I know if
you're in or not.
Hurry and get to your ship. I'll be in
touch before the race. This includes
blending all the animations from the
same facial poses so they all play
seamlessly from one another.
That's it for our UK studio update.
We're looking forward to a fun day at
CitizenCon this year on the 21st April
in Manchester.
Aaron and Brian will be there along with
others taking part in Q&A panels and
many more of the team enjoying a day of
interaction with the community.
They're running a raffle with some great
prizes and tickets are still available
via the link in the description below.
And of course, thank you to all our
backers for continuing to support the
development of both Star Citizen and
Squadron 42.
Thank you, Ricky. Uh so it's pretty
impressive to see just how many areas of
Star Citizen that the UK studio is
working on from big procedural stuff
like the rest stops to polishing and
fine-tuning audio, facial animation,
weapon balance, and combat, and even
updates to Arena Commander. You also saw
some of the optimization improvements
they've been working on with focus on
the visor displays and personal manager
app. Yeah, we continue to fine-tune the
PMA improving its look and usability
from what you saw in 3.0. Let's take a
closer look at the PMA in this week's
feature.
In 3.0 we released the MobiGlass just
kind of like our first iteration into
the kind of new UI that we had
envisioned for it. It was an improved
version but it was it still had a lot of
issues in terms of the usability.
Basically how it fit in the world um
and how it had some kind of issues with
your mouse cursor um when you breathe
you would run into these issues where
your mouse would be on the button at at
one point and then be off and then be on
again just because of the breathing. Um
so we took a look at some solutions to
fix that and
uh what we have now is is a
you know a much more uh intuitive and
usable interface because of the new way
we actually attach it. So we actually
right now attach the MobiGlass via an IK
uh solution so
what we do is we specify where an IK
target point is relative to the player's
camera. So uh once we have that point
then we can just procedurally animate
the arm up and we'll have some offsets
that we can actually tweak uh to really
kind of cuz it's especially very very
pixel per pixel uh you know pixel
perfect. We want to be pixel perfect
with the stuff. And and have it be just
the right size like if it's just too
slightly too big then you know we'll
we'll we'll really want to adjust that.
So now we've got the actual control to
uh specify these offsets for the
MobiGlass and it really allowed us to
really dial in the scale and the
positioning that we wanted on screen to
facilitate an optimal user experience.
So the other benefit that came with that
is now in all these different contexts
whether it's an EVA or whether it's on
foot or you're crouching or you're in
these various different ships actually
now that we have a single target point
that's relative to the player's camera
the UI is now in a much more consistent
place. Uh so the positioning and the
scale is much more consistent now in all
of the different contexts uh because
before what had happened is that you'd
have specific poses uh that that
animators had to hand animate and when
the animators are animating this uh they
actually it's very hard for them to
actually see their um
positioning is going to actually end up
in the engine. So they they think it's
Maya. I'm not actually sure what they
they work in but when they try to
integrate in the engine it's usually
like in a different place so they kind
of have to approximate it. And so before
all the MobiGlass
poses in the different contexts were all
approximated. So you you ended up with
maybe in in crouch like part of it was
cut off or or angled a little bit more.
So now we can actually have
a much more control and uh fine-tuning
of of that sort of stuff. So it's it's
been really great and it really helps in
addition to all the other changes that
we made in terms of utilizing more of
the screen real estate as well. One
thing that we did in in looking at the
current 3.0 vehicle manager and player
manager was the kind of awkward menu. So
we basically have a an accordion
menu system whereupon you have to drop
down
lists and then when you click on
something that then transition to a
whole different window and if you wanted
to change another part or something to
view view items in another part you have
to go back and then drop down another
menu and then select that. So
it was kind of a lot of user clicks in
order to actually you know get to where
you actually wanted to go. We had the
kind of the list on the side this
concertina list with the 3D model that
you could see where like rotate it
around see where things were.
That concertina wasn't didn't really
work for us. There was too many items in
there.
It kept collapsing. So, we needed to fix
that anyway cuz it just wasn't as
usable. But really we weren't using a
lot of the the screen space and I think
that was a problem that we saw very
early on with the Mobi in general that
was like, this is really cool thing at
any point you can open it up and
see what you've got, but
there's a lot of screen
going wasted. So,
from a readability standpoint because it
was a lot smaller on screen, we really
wanted to bring that out. So,
making it bigger, filling the screen was
a big thing. And then once we had that
extra screen space, we didn't need to
keep collapsing things down.
That was really it was a space saving
um choice. So, by putting two separate
columns on the left, you could pick your
hard point, and you could pick what you
put on it, and it's still got plenty of
screen space to see your character
model, see the details on the side. So,
by bringing the view in,
all of a sudden it opened a lot of doors
from a from a usability standpoint. So,
another great benefit that actually just
simply fell out of this approach that
we're taking is that now we've solved
the flickering cursor issue. Now that
like the UI is much more full screen and
it's and it's much more straight on to
your camera. So, it's much more usable.
However, one of the things that we're
concerned about with that is how much
more static the UI was going to seem uh
with that approach. And you know, we
thought we needed might might have
needed to stop the actual breathing. So,
you know, you'd just be like a statue.
And so, we really
we didn't really want to take that away,
but at the same time, you know, uh we
you know, we needed to improve the
overall kind of usability. So, what
actually fell out of the approach was
that
we can still have breathing and and as
you run, as you maybe after a long
sprint, you can pull up your MobiGlass
and what you want to see is like yeah,
you're you want to be able to feel that
your character is out of breath even,
you know, whether you know, regardless
of the context you're in. You still see
the UI moving, but your the cursor
position is always going to be in in the
same place regardless of the movement.
Even though we have the cursor is
actually on on the 2D
plane in front of the MobiGlass
technically. So, it's it's a it's it's
much improved for sure. For a lot of the
apps now, we've also done a massive push
to unify the layouts across the vehicle
loadout, the player loadout, and the
MobiGlass.
And we wanted to unify
that kind of UI with the loadout uh
the UIs in in Star Marine and Arena
Commander. We're also going to reuse
that for the shop item as well. So, the
shop item kiosk, essentially, we can
really reuse the same system. So, we
really get a lot of return out of doing
these efforts in terms of unifying
uh the UI in both the code base as well
as the layout cuz you also want to unify
the layout uh because you establish user
familiarity. Um so, once a user is
familiar with one thing, then across all
of these other interfaces, they can
they already know pretty much uh 90% how
to actually interact with it. And and
they're in you know,
that's a really a great thing for us
uh in terms of development as well
because that's means less work when we
have a unified code base. We've always
wanted to unify the all these different
UIs. Um so, you'll notice in before in
in 2.6 like in in 3.0, we had this very
specific Star Marine loadout screen that
was different from the AC loadout.
Basically, you had a very specific, you
know, here's your primary weapon, here's
your secondary weapon. But you know, as
things expand, as we want to add more
hard points, you know, you want to be
able to attach
uh like a scope to your gun or different
different attachments to a particular
item. Um you know, we need to be able to
scale that. And what we have right now,
you know, can accommodate any kind of
additions and uh
uh um future uh future that we want to
we want to actually um
you know, introduce.
So, we already had the code base for
the vehicle and personal managers.
They were already using the same code
base. All we're doing really is changing
the 3D model the
the way that we build players really is
the same way way we're building ships.
It's a it's a skeleton with hard points
on it, item ports.
And you put a piece of armor on that
player or you put a a gun on that player
or you put a
uh missile launcher on a ship, it's all
the same hierarchy essentially. We're
just changing what's what's up front.
Technically, to update Arena Commander,
it already had the same code base. We
just needed to put a new layer on top,
but Star Marine required completely
ripping out a whole old system. So, it
was this kind of
rotten bit of wood and everything else
is working. So, that was the the biggest
technical challenge was to
pull out the way that we
set up our characters cuz they were all
having bespoke loadouts and and systems
that. So, that needed redoing. It also
meant that if we were switching over to
a new system, we needed a way of
tracking
what I was using in elimination versus
what I'm using um
in last stand.
When you're picking one team versus
another, we needed a loadout system,
which is something we hadn't had in um
the PMA currently. So, that needed
adding. So, there was a couple of new
systems that needed to go in.
Um but that gives us a good groundwork
now for what we plan to do with 3.2
moving forward and expanding um loadouts
in general so you can save them in the
future. Bug fixing as well. So, I mean
if there's something wrong in the base
implementation somewhere, then we fix
that and that propagates to anywhere
where we have that where we have where
we use that code base. For testing
obviously, any change you make, we have
to test across everywhere where that UI
is used. So, not so much for testing,
but uh definitely for future
development, we can just hey, let's use
let's use this unified code base. We can
use it for we can use it for the
character customizer, we can use it for
uh shop item kiosk cuz in the shop item
kiosk, there's something that's that
we're going to that we're that we're
planning for the
for the next release is essentially
being able to
pick any
you know, pick any port on your ship or
or hard point and see all the valid uh
items that are available in that
particular shop. So, it's just filtered
differently, but it's the same actual
interface. So, the other thing too is,
you know, we can also, you know, it's
not doesn't necessarily have to be bound
to oh, you pick a hard point and then
you see the items. We can also do the
reverse whereupon we see all the items
and then we can see what valid hard
points there are as well. So, there's
both option. We would we would want both
options there cuz there's use cases for,
you know, both. So. So, long term this
means in Star Marine, you can save a
elimination a last stand for marine, a
last stand outlaw um loadout.
It means that we can prep the ground now
for
player created loadouts. Not just not in
Star Marine, but in in the PU. So, if
the player's got their favorite uh
exploration loadout or they've got their
favorite combat loadout or they've got
their favorite stealth loadout, they can
set what they want, save it,
and then when they move up to a a locker
or something, they can quickly switch
their gear and it'll remember, oh, you
want this helmet and this undersuit
rather than having to manually go
through each. So, by the the need that
we had for
Star Marine to have those fixed
loadouts, it means we had to do the work
up front to be able to save and then
load back up loadouts. So, moving
forward, we should be able to start
implementing player created loadouts and
um and that's quite cool. Skinning-wise,
uh obviously they can be branded. We
have a branding system at least in the
kiosk that we've actually have uh in the
commodity kiosk where we right now it's
just branded uh at Port Olisar. And we
actually have a different brand for
GrimHEX where it's, you know, more more
like a dust terminal. So, it's it really
kind of fits into the uh
uh kind of the the feeling in the
environment uh much better. So, when we
have those different skins, obviously,
you know, they're just different skins,
but under underneath it all it's all the
same. In the short term, we're going to
be hopefully seeing a lot more usable
um MobiGlass.
It's full screen now. There's a lot the
icons have been brought down to the
bottom. So, it should be a lot more
readable, um a lot more intuitive.
Players should be able to quickly see
where things are, what they can fit on
things, and be able to read the text a
lot clearer. So,
for 3.1, we wanted to make sure that it
was better under the hood, but also
a lot more convenient to use.
So, yeah.
It was it was largely dealing with all
the problems we either didn't get fixed
for 3.0 or
all the feedback that we could got to
address and say like, let's make sure
that this is great moving forward
because there's a lot of
other apps, the map and mission manager
and things like that that we want to
tackle that that need bringing up to a a
better level. So, this was kind of the
first step at at an iteration that I
mean, throughout Star Citizen, we talk
about we put things out there, listen to
the community, improve things. This is
that in in action really. It's putting
something out there in our first pass,
getting that immediate feedback, but it
actually being able to then quickly turn
around rather than waiting three, four,
five months to be able to say, right,
let's get on that immediately because
this is
this is a barrier for people enjoying
the game. So, let's let's get that
fixed. So, in terms of what's going into
3.1, um
so, in terms of the yeah, there's a lot
of stuff UI-wise, um but you know,
when we're talking about the MobiGlass,
a new overhauled vehicle manager app, a
new overhauled player loadout app
uh is going in as well as a um new
contracts manager as well. It's largely
the same kind of functionality as you as
you saw previously. It's just a much
more streamlined user experience. Yeah,
for 3.1, we've been focusing on making
it all usable. On the Star Marine and
Arena Commander loadouts as well, we've
been using the same system. They kind of
separated. We had the one that was on
MobiGlass. We had a bespoke system
solely for Star Marine, and then we had
the old system on Arena Commander. And
what we wanted to do for 3.1 was bring
those all under one roof. Make sure it's
a single code base. It all looks the
same, so the player knows exactly where
things live and what they can do in one
they can do in the others. It meant that
any bug fixes we do in the future
that's all taken care of immediately. Um
so it makes moving forward a lot more
streamlined. And
Zane can then have a singular design
vision. If we add one widget on one
thing, it's it's everywhere. Bringing
the Star Marine loadout and the AC
loadout in line with what we're the work
we're already be planning to do
for personal manager app and the vehicle
manager app. That was a kind of a big
overhaul that really sets us up now
moving forward. It's a game within a
game, so a lot of the user interface
kind of felt like it didn't need to be
one in the same to what was in Star
Citizen itself, but it meant that we had
two ways of doing the same thing. So
by and large, the end goal of kind of
let's consolidate these needed doing
sooner or later. But what we got in for
for 3.0, and it's been there for a while
I say I think since 2.6 brought in Star
Marine updates, that user interface did
exactly what we needed to do. But as
we're looking to add more items that you
can buy with REC and
improve the experience in Star Marine,
that needed to grow.
And the the interface in Star Marine
just wasn't able to add new items and
and things like that cuz it's it's all
very handmade. So it needed updating.
And as we were fixing bugs, we had a
whole bunch of
3.0 bugs that needed to look at. It
became very clear that we're fixing
these bugs twice. There's two There's a
bug for this and a bug for that. And so
it became very clear that instead of
just doing all this, let's just do the
work up front that we needed to do
eventually anyway. Let's just get it
done now, and then it's it's taken care
of. So for MobiGlass on a larger scale,
we want to look at the star map more.
That's that's got a lot of work to doing
to kind of make it more usable, more
readable.
Use the space that we now have. I think
that was kind of constrained before. So
we've got a lot more space now, so
using the space better for the star map,
so it's it's more intuitive because I
think that's going to be
once you've got your kit and you've got
your ship,
finding where to go is is the next big
thing. So we've got something that
works, but making that better. We've
also got things like the journal
and other
secondary apps that you're not going to
be using all the time that we want to
make sure work really well, so they'll
be coming through um down the line. And
then in terms of
the VMA and PMA,
those apps, they've still got a whole
bunch of stuff that needs to come in. We
want to improve um the stat readout. At
the moment, there's just kind of
basic information and basic size
information, but there's a whole bunch
of stats and under the surface that
aren't being read into the screen yet
that we want to show. So you'll be able
to compare this gun to that gun, that
piece of armor to that piece of armor.
So that when you're deciding, do I want
a big heavy piece of equipment or a
light piece of equipment? It's like,
well, this protects for more damage, but
it's going to slow me down or it's going
to take longer to to aim or to move. And
so players can make conscious decisions
about when they find a a derelict and
they find a piece of equipment that's
just floating in space, do I want to
take this with me? They can compare
stats immediately, which is also useful
in the market. It's also useful when
creating your favorite loadouts. So
there's a whole bunch of additional
features that we want. Now that we feel
like it's a usable system and and that
flow has been sorted, layering in now
personally created loadouts, stat
comparison, new features that the that
we think are going to enhance and make
people use that more and and get more
value out of it. So another thing that
we have going into 3.1 is an overhauled
Arena Commander and Star Marine loadout
screen. So Star Marine is no longer a
bespoke UI. It's it's using the same
unified system
uh that we set forth with the personal
manager and vehicle manager in the
MobiGlass. So those all have been
unified.
We have a character customizer UI, the
the first iteration of that at least
going in for to 3.1.
Um obviously um looking to expand
into um much more robust features later
down the line. Of course, as is with
everything, new overhauled mission
manager UI, largely the same
functionality in terms of missions, uh
but just streamline user experience and
streamline um user interface layout. And
addition to that, service beacon
functionality. So the ability to create
service beacons uh and user generated
missions that you can accept um
and you know, you can view other
players' missions. Uh so you know,
there's a lot more player generated kind
of content there. Obviously, we want to
um you know, later down the line
introduce more filters so you can have
you know, I want missions just of this
rating or or more. Or I want only
contracts of this type. So you will have
all of that functionality
to implement later down the line, but
this is now kind of like our first
iteration of that. So it's
as we get new features, they're they're
really um kind of rudimentary um and and
basic, but they expand over times. Now
obviously, it's great to have the screen
real estate to be able to expand into.
So um you know, another reason why we're
happy about um the foundation that we
set with the new MobiGlass and layout.
Um there are also
uh some new improvements to the ship UI
and HUD. Um so now we have feed much
better feedback for the user in terms of
where they're hitting their target ship
or where they're getting hit. So it's
it's it's more obvious. Um and we
brought back some of the functionality
uh that we were that was missing from
the visor, including like EM and IR
signatures that you can now you can now
see. Um
Uh later down the line, there's a whole
lot of improvements that we want to make
to the ship UI. It's definitely not in a
like final state that we see it. So we
have um you know, improvements that we
still need to make for that and that
we'll we want to look for look to do for
for 3.2. So
But for now, one of the major
improvements that we made was to you
know, how the
uh ship model renders. Um so it's you
know, more efficient um and uh you know,
kind of easier to see. So in Star
Marine, the kind of the loadout presets
were necessitated cuz you have different
loadouts that you would need to use
whether you know, depending on what side
you're on. But base foundation of that
is actually uh going to
drive the idea of loadout presets where
you can save a particular configuration
and just quickly
uh you know, change into that loadout.
So you don't have to just do it
everything individually. So we'll have
you know, you know, you'll be able to
set your own loadout presets. So it's
much more easier to access um what you
like and you know, for different roles
like stealth and so forth. So making
sure that it's not
it's not like a mobile phone where
you've got 700 apps and it's like, where
is the thing that I actually need? Make
sure it is
cuz you don't want to be playing the
game off off your wrist. You want to be
out there in the 'verse playing it
properly. So
striking the right balance between
what's too much information, what's not
enough information, and and a lot of
that's going to come from community
feedback, listening to what the fans
say, more of this, less of that. I find
this quite hard.
I'm having trouble with this.
And and that's worked really well from
3.0 into 3.1, keeping that going,
keeping our ears open, and listening to
that feedback as we constantly keeping
an eye on
what the community says on Spectrum and
on Reddit and and other formats.
We get a sense of what they want more
of, what they want less of, and we can
say, does this align with what we want?
Does this Does this make sense? Yeah,
that would be a good use of Mobi. This
wouldn't be a good use of Mobi.
Even if people want
the fastest point from A to B, and
sometimes that mean let me just buy my
cargo from my MobiGlass.
Because why do I have to get off my
ship, go into the thing? And but
sometimes that's not what No, because we
want you to physically go there because
it's part of the experience of of
traveling. If you could do everything
from your wrist, you'd never leave your
cockpit. There's some things that don't
suit MobiGlass, and there's some things
that absolutely do that there's no other
way you could change
what gloves you've got on other than
physically,
which would be horrible. So it's what do
we streamline, what don't we streamline?
But yeah, listening to the community
feedback, what is what do we feel like
that's important? And also
do we hear this a lot or do we hear it
from one person? One person really wants
a feature and like, okay, that sounds
cool, but realistically, that's going to
be 2 weeks worth of someone's work to
get that in versus
60, 70, 100 people have asked for this
one thing. Okay, well,
that's a big win for us and and it's
something we want to do, it's something
you desperately want. Let's let's put
that into the game. It's finding the
right time to put that in obviously, but
because we have
kind of quarterly cycles and it's
something we're constantly looking at,
we can just okay, let's let's drop that
in, let's drop that in. So we're looking
at the mission manager on the side
whilst we're also looking at the VMA and
PMA because it's it's
it's right there. It's like, oh, we just
need to just change a bit of this flash,
and then it's in. Great.
It's
a day's worth of work, and then we've we
improved that feature as well. So as
work comes in, we can just keep evolving
the design, so it's it's no longer a
case of it's MobiGlass 2.0 or 3.0. It's
it's the living MobiGlass. So while
we've made a lot of these improvements
um and we're able to accomplish a lot in
terms of improving the UI for 3.1,
there's still a ton of stuff that we
that we wanted to get in that we haven't
yet. So we want to be able to view stats
on the player. So and and be able to
compare items when you're actually using
this loadout screen. So that's a whole
another thing that we need to build in
still is is the stat comparison and you
know, if I equip this uh component to my
ship, how's that going to affect my
speed and my acceleration and so forth.
So we don't necessarily have too much of
that right now, but that's something
that's definitely we we're looking to
going into the future cuz, you know,
it's
it's a pretty vital especially in the
loadout screen. And just general kind of
uh effects as well. So, you know, we
we we need to have a much more improved
highlighting of the different uh items
that you're focusing on on the
character. So, that just comes with uh
shader improvements.
Um and
yeah, just the the general um
feeling of it is just going to be
iterated over time. So, I think we sort
of lost the zooming and panning
functionality, but we kind of we we
still, you know, in this unification
some stuff sort of got lost as they were
quite bespoke, but now we want to be
able to obviously have that
come back and and, you know, have this
nice feeling of the the ship or the
character and you you kind of zooming
out to the the port and that kind of
highlighting very nicely. That's
something that, you know, obviously
uh would be really nice to have, but
wasn't really necessarily critical uh
for 3.1. Um
but definitely going forward we uh we
want to add in that polish
for sure.
The PMA improves with every release. Uh
we still have a little more work to do
with the item previews, uh but we're
getting closer to the finished article
with every release. And that's all for
this week. Remember, if you're out there
in Alpha 3.1 and you're interested in
