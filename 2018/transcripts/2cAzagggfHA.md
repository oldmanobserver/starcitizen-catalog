hey everybody welcome to another edition
of calling all Deb's our weekly Q&A
series where I take questions from you
the star citizen backer and posed them
directly to our star system developers
usually over Skype
it's your a chance to submit your
questions and have them answered
immediately and directly by the folks
who are actually working on our game for
our first call today on this week's show
we are going back to Manchester UK and
our own Johnny just Sirius tech designer
weapons designer looking I don't do
titles Johnny how you doing man I'm
great job thank you how are you I'm
doing well there's a reason the title is
like right below Johnny's window right
this yeah
Johnny I got a question for you now
we're gonna break with tradition just a
little bit this question isn't actually
from from the front of spectrum that I
know I just got done doing that big
whole spiel that's what the show
normally is but but but today I want to
talk about this week I want to talk
about some topics that I think will be
interesting to people that questions
that have come from other places in
spectrum that aren't necessarily in this
thread for you your question this week
we've heard a lot about you know item
poor items system 2.0 we've heard about
ships 2.0 with the new pipeline that
would we feature every week or every
other week in shipshape
what is weapons 2.0 god I'm hearing that
I'm starting to see I'm sorry missing
emails talking about weapons 2.0 what
are we talking about here
yes so it's it's it's actually very
similar to what we've been doing with
the items and ships 2.0 and it's
essentially making things easier for us
going forward making everything a lot
more efficient especially code side as
well and in the case of weapons making
like kind of bespoke so much more of
like a thing of the past
so kind of previously using our like old
xml's we're now moving over today to
forge our I'll give a little shout-out
to tossed in
Frankfurt who's been working very hard
on this for months he's the coder who's
been working on the system with me a lot
yeah basically so we're avoiding bespoke
setup on weapons now because there were
cases where we wanted to make some
really really cool weapons for you guys
but we were really hampered by what we
could do with our existing system so we
were very limited to like just is it
rapid-fire as a burst fire as a single
shot and if we want us to do something
special we would have to get a coder
involved and jump in and kind of do a
bunch of work for us whereas now as we
kind of go further down the line and we
might start investigating some damage
types and things that start to get a
little bit more weird we might want to
have a lot more interesting behaviors on
like the new set of it it it just it's
difficult for me to kind of formulate
how much it absolutely does it in two
words but it's now we can combine
different fire modes in different ways
so the custodian as an example as a
weapon we've got live at the moment and
I think a lot of people know that in 3.1
a second fire mode might have slipped in
and that was because we were testing
ready for weapon 2.0 which is it always
was planned to have a charged burst on
the weapon so that was something we
could never do previously but now we can
use a charged fire mode with a burst in
cider and we can do what we need to with
the charge to make the burst better so
that's just an example of kind of how
robust the system is in that we can and
do all of these strain things with the
strange things without needing code
support any more specifically on FPS
weapons we're also looking at recoil so
we just been kind of like using a simple
reasonably simple recoil system that
we've got in our mannequin editor at the
moment and that's all being moved to
dataforge as well so it's a lot easier
for people like me to use and edit live
while I'm actually playing the game so I
can do a lot more fine-tuning on there
and we're getting a lot more kind of
like camera movement involved in
everything to make the weapons feel a
lot more punchy because we've been been
listening to you guys and a lot of
people think that we're not going we're
not rough enough with the weapons
they're not they don't feel punchy
enough so that was one of the things we
took on board were when we were
redeveloping this stuff and one of the
very big things for FPS is the
attachment system we we really want to
start pushing on that and I'm not saying
it's gonna be coming anytime soon but
we've allowed for all of the stats on
the weapons to be modifiable so we can
start to think about adding things like
silences compensators different scopes
and all this kind of thing that you can
kind of change in and out and you PMA
and you'll be able to see your weapon
stats change and feel an affect on the
weapon overall so yeah we're we're
really leaving it open on the FPS side
basically for all of our systems going
forward so we've really kind of
future-proofed our system here ship
weapons specifically as well we can we
can do some new interesting things on
there now that we've got ship an item
2.0 or it's kind of a currently in
process like you say we can now tie
weapon behaviors a lot more into the
heat and power system and they never
been before like previously we pretty
much only really had is the weapon on or
off or is it overheated we can now kind
of take a look at like how much power is
it receiving and then like kind of curve
the stats a certain amount like oh if
it's only receiving half power then it's
fires half of half as fast it's only
half as damaging and stuff like that so
we can even start investigating
something like the hotter the weapons
running the more like damage it does all
the faster it fires so you kind of
skirting that line between overheating
and kind of reaching your max firepower
so yeah like there's a kind of like the
main points that I really wanted to
cover so I'm pretty excited about this
going forwards and actually getting it
into game but I'm not sure I can't say
when it's actually coming at well
luckily for our backers we have a lovely
RSI public roadmap where so when you
have an idea like I said not said a
number of times not everything is on the
roadmap
things you know that will come out after
quarter 1 2019 certainly aren't down
there but some things that we're working
on now and that might even come up this
year are not on the roadmap they're not
in Rohit because we haven't developed it
farther enough for us to have a really
solid idea of when it might be
implemented cancer or its waiting on
other but let's throw a dependency it's
waiting on other dependencies and step
like that but uh this is another great
example of game development versus game
construction you know you started with a
weapon system based on XML like so many
of our systems did that was a CryEngine
staple back in the day yep now as we've
progressed through the lumberyard and
through our own star engine improvements
and Karstens work with with a data
foregin stuff we can now iterate and
make a system that that really suits our
needs so that that's what that's what
you're seeing here and you'll and
hopefully you'll see the you'll reap the
rewards of this new system in the coming
months yeah yeah all right man thank you
so much Johnny io I wanted to want to
pitch you a weapon well I've got a
weapon guy you're seeing how about you
ever seen Howard the Duck remember that
the neutron disintegrator well half the
I've seen how the duck I'm not familiar
with that gun it's it's the gut it's the
gun they they use at the end to kill the
dark overlord of the universe sort of
try to kill the dark over there it
wasn't very effective
actually it was it no never mind don't
do it thank you very much see ya alright
thank you so much Johnny for our next
call we're going right back here to the
Los Angeles studio and our own cherie
heiberg archivist extraordinaire on the
lore team here sherry hey dude
oh hey Jen welcome to calling all this
mmm golf glad to be here
I'd say it's better than the response I
get most times um I've got a question
for you this is a question from the
backers submitted by the backers voted
on by the backers okay it says will
there be an in-game way to to research
the lore and history of the star Sasan
universe something diegetic like a
museum on various planets or what well
um that's an interesting question I
would very much like I'm just gonna put
this others like an idea that I've been
batting around and something that I'd
really like to come to fruition one day
you know we have the Ark in game I would
very much like that to be a destination
where players can go not only to explore
a really cool museum like space but to
actually access the collective PDA
through it there are other ways to that
I would like players to be able to
access the collective PDA like through
your mobi glass that's one of the
biggest goals that I really really want
to see realized so that players can
access galactic pedia both through their
browser actually like some some kind of
app we have on the website or through
your mobile glass in game and what is
the Galactic pedia itself or anybody
that might not know well the Galactic
pedia is the in progress in-game
encyclopedia documenting the history and
lore of the star citizen universe oh I
have imagine that probably takes up a
fair amount of time it does but we're
doing active work on it right now we had
we've had a couple of meetings with
turbulent to talk about it so it's in
the work on the tech side and on the
lower side it's been in the works for
quite some time now it's cool well thank
you very much I'll let you get back to
work okay thanks all right thank you so
much Sheri
up next we've got our own Chad McKinney
a gameplay programmer with a question
about quantum travel I think he's
perfect for Chad how you doing man hey
man how's it going I'm going well for me
I got a question it's kind of curious
seems like an obvious thing but you know
who knows this question says will
quantum travel be blocked inside
asteroid fields it seems silly to
quantum direct quantum travel directly
to and from grim max yeah it does and
the reason why it's like this is because
of a combination actually have some
optimizations in code so one of them has
to do with the fact that we don't want
to do long raycast which is how we kind
of figure out something is within a
certain distance of something else in
physics doing that over cosmic scales
can other leak rush your computer so we
do some smart optimizations to only do
intersection testing against celestial
bodies for quantum travel so this skips
kind of smaller things out scale we do a
near field raycast check against
something that you're directly in front
of or close enough to be in front of the
other there's actually another
optimization actually prevents this from
working which is the asteroids
themselves are physicalized at a
distance anyways it's even if they were
wouldn't work long story short the game
is more efficient because of some
optimizations we put in however this is
not an unsolvable problem we just
haven't spent the time yet to come up
with a good methodology to include the
intersection testing for the asteroids
in the case of quantum trouble that is a
solvable problem and it's something that
we do want to do and the relative
near-term it's not on the schedule that
I have seen for this particular release
but we know about the problem and we
know that we want to fix it so it's it's
it will happen that I have absolutely no
doubt all right channel let's get back
to work man thanks so much cool no
problem
all right and finally but you might
notice I'm not in the office right now
our last question of the show is to good
friend john pritchett who works out of
his home office so I figured if he if I
got a call the guy at home I'm gonna
take the call at home
why not it also doesn't help that it's
like 10:30 at night here and that's just
I'm not gonna be in the office at night
so we are calling like I said john
pritchett a physics guru extraordinaire
John how you doing man doing good thanks
for working me into your schedule I know
it's late thank you for taking it for
working me into your schedule you're not
the easiest person to get a hold of I
know you're very busy you got your
fingers on a whole lotta aspects of star
citizen so thank you so much what is
your title I'm terrible with titles do
you know you know what your title is
yeah it's just physics programmers is it
for you I don't know what my title is
half the time a community veteran
community it's all over the place I got
a question for you
it's from the backers it's voted on by
the backers the question has to do with
grab Lev basically this person wants to
know what the deal is with hoverbikes in
their current implementation is this how
they're supposed to be is there more
work to be done
now I knows a bit of a loaded question
because you've recently made some
posting on spectrum so that's I think
the timing of this is perfect why don't
you want to start us off well what's
going on with grab live well I mean
first of all when when it came out in
3.0 obviously it was completely broken I
haven't really seen much evidence from
from the live version that it's it's
doing anything that I wanted it to do so
you know we did our best
crunched all the way down to the end but
I think we had it working pretty well up
to about a day before release but still
didn't make it out there in good
conditions so now you're talking about
one of those things where you've got the
individual system working and then when
you start pulling all these other
systems together and a big patch yeah
but when you say you had it working the
day before start putting all the pieces
together that's where come from right
right so yeah and really a lot of people
if you played the game you know I have
CS itself has been in pretty bad shape
since 3.0 came out there were just so
many changes to the
engine and there wasn't time to really
do a proper fix so that a lot of those
things affect grab live as well as
general ifcs
there were some some greater issues
really with grab left so yeah I mean if
you can get it to hover at all
you're lucky right now but the changes
that I've made that work I've been doing
on it since the start of the year it's
really coming along and we've got it up
for testing on PTU and I'm getting you
know good results good testing good
feedback with that and you know we're
hoping to I don't know if it's gonna be
something we can get into a 3-1 patch
you may be gettin too late for that
but certainly 3.2 is definitely what
we're aiming for yeah I know I know you
were just we were talking before we were
setting up the call that you said you
were working on getting at getting a
patch out to p2 you to test some of
these fixes everything so so yeah it's
it's still too early to know whether
we're gonna have a big improvement in
the 3-1 branch or whether it's going to
have to roll into the 3-2 and of course
let's be completely honest with folks
it's possible that what happened with
300 might happen with 3-2 as we start
combining things together but we're not
going to give up it's not a sign of
course throw our hands up and be like oh
well it's just fine the way it is yeah
we got you and and and other programmers
and engineers you know all working to
make this a enjoyable experience right I
think it's safe to say the when we first
introduced the very first space bike the
dragonfly you know however long ago now
that really captured a lot of you know
of backers imaginations and it's
definitely an experience that that we
want we want to be as enjoyable and
awesome as possible sure what can tell
us about what you want to achieve with
grad level like describe to me as best
you can obviously we're on a Skype calls
late at night but describe to me how you
want this what's the goal here okay well
one of the real challenges you know for
a system like this is I don't want to
implement something that's a very
specific hover behavior I want it to be
a very generalized system and then turn
that over to the designers and give them
a lot of flexibility for them to decide
you know this is a bike or this is a
tank or whatever and get a lot of
variation out of that you know so there
there's some you know specific
approaches that I've taken
or for how you can you know implement or
tune hover for for all these different
vehicles so for the the dragonfly and
the NOx really not a lot of variation
there I kind of see the dragonfly as
being more of an off-roader and the NOx
being more like a road bike you know a
street bike so you tend to want the NOx
to hover fairly low and require fairly
you know flat terrain not a lot of
variation without it I'm starting to
bottom out and things like that
unfortunately right now the NOx for
there are a few issues with it it's not
even behaving as well as I would expect
it to even on a straight flat ground
it's dragging so but you know the
dragonfly you want that you know be able
to get out on a little bit more rough
terrain and kind of feel the bumps and
and you know have a little bit more
control over over you know rough terrain
and so really to achieve that III have a
system where the hover by control hover
vehicle control system basically is
determining based on the terrain that
you're over and also the terrain that it
sees coming what it wants its elevation
to be and so it's it's constantly saying
okay well I need to be you know you know
10 meters off the ground right now or
five meters off the ground or whatever
if you're if you're on nice flat cruise
then it can be right down there you know
have a meter off the ground right so it
sets a goal elevation and then the the
physics of the system is a you know
basically essentially a spring
simulation is going to then determine
the the the rise and fall well not
actually the fall the Falls is generally
going to come from gravity but but
pushing it up you know to achieve
whatever elevation the the control
system is looking for so I think that's
that's basically what we're seeing as
the main issue is that control system
isn't getting enough data really to be
able to make good decisions about its
elevation and and as opposed to the
system not being able to achieve the
elevation well you know that it's
desired right so anyway getting back to
your question you're asking Wow
go man go yeah so how have I implemented
it in order to achieve you know the
vision that we had for right for for
heavy vehicles correct so what your
vision was yeah well that's basically it
I mean I I just wanted to essentially be
as close to physically realistic you
know acceleration driven hover being
very very careful not not to you know
that the the gravel of itself is only
ever really pushing you up right so then
like if you go up then the gravity's
going to pull you back down so you feel
like you're kind of you know catching
air if it feels like you're jumping as
opposed to a system that's like managing
your full elevation up and down and then
of course grab grab Lev is really
frictionless when it comes to lateral
you know so when you're turning and
things that's when thrusters from the
vehicle are going to come into play and
and that that's I think something
different that we do then you see with a
lot of hover bikes and games is the fact
that it's a hybrid you know atmosphere /
space vehicle so it has full thruster
control when it needs it we go into
hover mode really I think more as a
matter of efficiency because you know
then you're not having to burn thrusters
to stay aloft and and and you can say it
save on fuel and all that you're still
using those thrusters for a lot of
maneuvering how much does the overall
atmospheric flight model plane to this I
mean it the the atmospheric flight model
then you know we want we want ships to
we want all ships to function
differently a Jungian a mo than they do
you know in outer space that's not a
hundred percent you know either at this
time how much of how much of this work
is is just grab live and how much is it
you know work on the atmospheric flight
model yeah well I mean the thing is
really holding it up is I'm fixing a lot
of things I have CS itself the
atmospheric flight model grab live I
have to have all that done before any of
it can be checked in so I actually have
made significant progress on the
atmospheric model I talked in
a recent atv about you know where I
wanted to go with that and the main
thing was I wanted the the control
system to actually utilize drag and
gravity as part of its control as
opposed to the initial implementation
which was just that it would compensate
for those things and then its control
system was essentially the same as it is
in space
you know the compensation gets you to
the point where it's basically zero drag
and zero gravity and then the control
system it's similar to space except then
you have less thrust available because
those things are being used for
compensation so at this point you have
that right so like if you're pushing
into drag of course you have less thrust
available for accelerating forward
because you're expending a lot of that
thrust just to overcome drag but the
part that was missing was then when you
start to slow down it's actually using
drag that's pushing against the vehicle
as part of you're slowing down force as
opposed to nullifying that out and then
using thrusters to slow you down so now
when you when you turn and you Bank into
a turn you'll feel a much stronger
stopping motion you know on that slide
than if you were just doing a straight
wrong turn and not bringing as much of
the surface area of your ship into the
drag right so of course when you're
you're you're falling you're going down
you're gonna have a lot more
acceleration to to drop down because
gravity's helping you but as you're
going back up it's gonna work against
you and so you know all that variability
that you expect for atmospheres it's
gonna come into play and it's that's all
in there now and seems to be working
very well actually any how does that a
how does that affect the maneuvering
thrusters versus you know beat all like
we have we have ships like the reclaimer
the Terrapin have specific VTOL
thrusters sure right now ships are using
their maneuver through nuvaring
thrusters to basically you know hover
around in atmosphere what our future
plans yeah that well it's still evolving
right now what i plan to check in for
this version is that for vehicles that
have VTOL those those thrusters will be
utilized strictly for countering gravity
that that's their primary role and so
that leaves your maneuvering thrusters
free to give you as much acceleration as
you would normally have you know because
essentially the beatles have nullified
the gravity as opposed to you know if
you don't have the tall's then you're
taking at least one g out of depending
on the planet out of your your your
upward thrust and then whatever's left
you can have for maneuverability so with
with a vehicle that has beat all's you
would expect that it's plus zyy
maneuverability would be close to what
you you have in space but without beat
all's it because significantly less
gotcha and I know other developers have
spoken that if you're flying in a ship
that doesn't have be tall and you're
using your maneuvering thrusters to
hover and wanna that when the wear and
tear comes in four components that
that's going to wear a lot more on
maneuvering thrusters trying to hold
your ship in place and rights and heat
that will hopefully be a factor as well
yeah yeah so while you may be able to
float like a butterfly in a hornet or
whatnot in atmosphere you're gonna burn
those thrusters out a lot quicker than
if you have a dedicated ship with meat
all right like a Terrapin er yeah well
the plan we've talked about and I
haven't had a chance to really bring
that in yet is that your thrusters are
going to really have two modes one's
gonna be like how do you generate
sustained thrust like you would need for
gravity you know for a long period of
time versus what thrust can you generate
and like a quick hit like a quick Delta
V you know to get from zero to max SCM
velocity or whatever those are going to
be two different acceleration levels
basically call a sustained thrust versus
impulse thrust so the threats that you
have available for you know combat
maneuvers which are like quick impulses
to change velocities right those are not
going to be the same accelerations that
are available for oh okay I'm staying up
in acceleration I mean staying up in
gravity so yeah that'll make a big
difference
even without V tall's because you know a
lot of our fighters aren't necessary
going to have devoted feet all's yeah
alright one last question you know where
I'm gonna use you while I got you here
man
you're wrapping up the show here okay
let's talk about ifcs it the latter the
last of the things that you're working
on we touched about the atmosphere of
flight model we protect about the grav
lab ifcs
where is it right now and where do you
want it to go okay well you know if
you've played ifcs and played the you
know there's the game with you know
flown the ships in 3.0 you know that
ifcs basically has been drunk for a
while
it's really about it was me some people
can't tell but yeah you know just a lot
of the changes in the engine
optimizations and things hit it pretty
hard and it just wasn't something we
could just do a quick fix on so you know
it wasn't until after 3.0 that I could
really take the time and dig in and and
fix these things right so you know the
main thing I had to do was one of the
optimizations we did was moving a lot of
things off the main thread or in my case
the physics threads a big blocker on the
physics thread to do all the processing
for ifcs
so we moved basically the entire off
ifcs off the physics thread into a lazy
batch update which depending on load
will get called you know more or less
frequently and unfortunately that puts I
have CS out of sync with the physics
simulation the physics tick could run
you know through two or three times
before ifcs gets an update and and you
just can't have stable simulation that
way that was my question
all right right so basically my solution
to that is I had to go in and and
separate ifcs into two parts one is the
control system logic which is really
where all the load is and the other is
strictly the physics simulation part
where the the control logic says this is
what I want the ship to do based on you
know player input and all these things
and and you can update that state as
quickly as we can get it but then the
actual physics processing you know
generating the the accelerations and
everything that's working every physics
step in order to achieve whatever the
requested goal is from ifcs and so that
can remain you know as smooth and stable
as possible and so yeah I've done that
at this point
and that's working very well I'm still
working on trying to get ESP to work
properly with the new system that's why
in the PTU right now
combat is terrible so hopefully i'll get
that cleaned up here pretty quickly
using opinions if john pressure do not
represent those of platinum paring games
robert space industries or its
subsidiaries that's the feedback yeah
that's actually that's actually last
question i you're one of the you're one
of my favorite devs to be complete
candid because you spend you spend a
fair amount of time in spectrum you know
in the ask a dev threads you know
engaging with our backers getting their
feedback it's one of the reasons i
wanted to do this you know this when
this thrust when this question came up
you've been pretty active in in spectrum
talking about gravel if talking about
ifcs is that it for we give that a lot
of lip service but is that information
actually helpful is it helpful when
backers go to the spectrum and actually
post their experiences and post their
feedback well it definitely is for me
you know there's only so much I can do
because I'm very specifically involved
in simulation you know and how we
achieve the design goals and not so much
in what the design goals are of course I
pass everything I hear on to to other
devs
you know as well but yeah as does
everybody on the community 200 now I
wish I could be on I haven't been on
spectrum very much I spent a lot of time
on discord with you know the the epic
aadhi people or how do you say it right
but yeah I got to get got to get out on
spectrum more well John thank you so
much you made you made an epic wrap-up
to this week's show so I appreciate you
taking the time I know I know it's late
there it's like here so thank you for
fitting me in and when I have something
else for you I'll give you a Holly great
well thanks for including me all right
thank you sir
thank you bye all right well thank you
so much to john pritchett and that wraps
up another
pisode of falling all dibs hey hey Jared
yeah John you still there yeah you know
what I just realized there's something I
wanted to get into with with gravel EV
and I totally spaced it off well you
know I wanted to talk about basically
the the main thing that's left to do on
that so I really have the system
functioning pretty close to the way I
wanted to function when it's running you
know on a single-player game or a load
load multiplayer game but you know
unfortunately right now whenever there's
a heavy load on the server you know
gravel it just isn't getting enough data
about the the terrain to really be able
to make good decisions about you know
its elevation or whatever and and I
think that's that's why the performance
just really significantly drops off
based on server load and so that's
really the last thing that that I need
to get cleaned up I think before it's
going to actually be out in live and and
and performing in a way that that you
know hopefully players will be happy
with optimization basically yeah
definitely that's a good chance to
remind folks that you know it's it works
one way on your computer when you're
doing it then we go to evocati and
they've got this many people and it
starts very different ways then we go to
wider PTU and we've got even more people
and it starts to work
you know like yes and then when we go to
our live alpha environment then starts
to you know to kind of go sideways and
that is the process that we're in that's
it's important to remember that every
star citizen environment is a testing
environment so even the live alpha
environment so you guys helped you guys
helped us tremendously get in there to
hammer this thing because that's where
we see the real data there's virtue and
what we get from evocati there's virtue
and what we get from p2u but the best
data we get is live so play the game
file your issue council reports go to
spectrum and tell john pritchett you
know what's up you know it's it's that
