## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse
I'm sandy Gardner and I'm Chris Wallace
this week Jarrod's back with an
installment of ship-shape on the Vandal
blade yes and we'll see what's in store
for the immediate future of shopping
chaos I know you all want to know but
first let's go once again and Rikki
gently for this week's tar sands and
projects update yes let's take a look at
where we are on the roadmap and what the
doves have been up to thanks guys
let's get things tired and take a look
at the roadmap more progress has been
made on the mining mechanic Laser arc
highlights are in and working but the
VFX are just placeholders and will be
replaced once new tech is complete right
now we have three levels of breakage for
rocks with a fourth still to be added
and we're still tinkering with the
physics to get just right Rock
destruction VFX work is also ongoing
with work being done on specific States
like in progress mining safe mining and
incorrect dangerous mining again the
visuals here will be replaced with new
tech once it's available so that beam
you're seeing isn't the finished article
implementing feedback from chris Roberts
we've been adjusting the way the tractor
beam looks and acts as well as making
further tweaks to the scanning and
mining UIs which will be finalized
once the prospectors boom arm is
complete it has been determined that
your weapons will be offline while in
mining mode due to the power allocation
and we're still working on the button
interaction and key bindings that will
switch and control the modes test cases
are being implemented to help various
teams get FPS AI working in the pu in
this example you see the AI running on a
server with an outpost being used as the
test level as you can see the AI don't
behave as expected due to many factors
which do not become apparent until they
are placed in real-world scenarios such
as running over a network
or being within the zone of a rotating
planet these levels highlight issues
like this and provide teams a testbed to
work more rapidly on fixes early VFX
work has been done on the death masks
for several ships here you see first
damaged pass effects for the aegis
avenger rework and damage effects are
being worked on for several other ships
including the anvil hurricane that's
some pretty cool explosions this team
has also been working on ballistic
weapon VFX improvements including a more
natural muzzle flash and less intrusive
tracers as seen here with submachine
guns and sound design is being worked on
for some of the FPS guns planned for
alpha 3.2 like gemini 55
and the scalpel sniper rifle
environmental where continues on the
hangers that you'll be seeing in
Denarius space stations with more areas
in the gray box design phase such as the
drone base scene here we've also been
adding thematic panels to add visual
interest and open up opportunities for
interesting AI interactions and
narrative choices in these locations
finally door animations have been
blocked in which also adds some nice
dramatic touches
work continues on the planet Hairston
with its multiple biomes being visually
developed and tested and its landing
zone lovel really starting to come
together
here we see visual work on an acidic
biome the asset tinting applied here as
seen in last week's update really helps
this biome allowing less assets to do
more and the distribution of rocks
continues to be improved also some
visual tweaks are being made to the
sulfur pools that dominate this
environment and here are some
work-in-progress renderings of a savanna
biome with trees and lighting getting
some attention this area is also being
used as a testing ground for wind and
detail bending you can see the visual
and geographic diversity that's being
developed for Hurston and its moons
beginning to take shape finally we get
more glimpses of the Hurston trash biome
if any of the sets really represent the
environmentally compromised planet it's
definitely the trash biome as low levels
visual development continues the
environment our team is putting together
these prototypes for artistic direction
mood and to show what VFX will be needed
that's all for this week we'll see you
next time for more pee-yew progress back
to you in the studio
thanks Ricky so we'll have more pee-yew
updates in the coming weeks and you can
always follow along with the road map
wait a week on the RSA website one of
your features set for alpha 3.2 that
we've been tracking on the road map
these last few weeks is item kiosk
shopping yes as you've seen in previous
project updates the functionality UI and
visual presentation of the kiosk
continues to evolve
let's see where the teams are on this
system which will open up the ability to
purchase a lot more items than we have
room for in some of our stores what's
planned for three two's release and
beyond in this week's feature
so right now we're working on a shopping
kiosk and what that's gonna be is that
said in Weld screen that the player can
walk up to in any shop and location and
actually purchase items from that shop
for the item kiosk work we actually took
some inspiration from the VMA and the
PMA we started adding those systems in
terms of like displaying items
displaying the ship items and giving the
option to select the items that we wish
to research we took of course on some
notes from the commodity kiosk system
that we currently have and adding those
two systems to one step actually showing
the character loadout and also the
vehicle loadout and presenting with
items that we have available in that
store for that particular let's say
cooler or engine or missile that we want
to browse by time we finished the
implementation it's not gonna look like
the the PMA or the or the VMA on the
mobi glass they'll obviously have a
complete reskin there'll be additional
flow when trying to explain how the VMA
and the PMA actually work is that we
have a request the user makes a request
we go into our what we call persistency
we make a request for let's say player
number one requests the items that he
has on his vehicle number one and the
server will return to us a bunch of
items that belong to that vehicle to
that character and we then with those
items well we basically need to
transform the data and make it
presentable for the user in a really
nice way how Discipline kiosk is let's
say a player goes into a store he has
his Gladius pre-selected he goes into
the store and he wants to see which
items apply to his Gladius let's say he
picks a cooler player will need to
request to persistency i want to see
every cooler that works on my Gladius
for this ship and the server will return
to us all of the items and then
we have the data that we can then
present to the player in a nice way
in the item kiosk shop we already have a
kind of dynamic platform that we can use
to create loadouts may they be for let's
say you character or it'd be a ship or a
ground vehicle or something like that we
can reuse these systems to actually load
in let's say items that we have
available in a store though going
through that steps of following some
systems that we already have in place
would be the easiest step to actually
getting a new system up so essentially
the user interface is an extension of
the personal manager and vehicle manager
where their navigation scheme is largely
the same however there's some key
differences that we need to take into
account for the shop so in for instance
displaying price as factoring stats and
the comparison functionality well it's
the flow for just purchasing in general
and selling it so in terms of the actual
skimming of the UI we've worked on a
branding system where this kiosk can
basically be in multiple different shops
and what we want to have is the actual
branding being reflected on the kiosk
but in the way that its scalable for us
so if there's twenty thirty shops fifty
different shops a hundred different
shops we can just slot in different
branding and styles that will make a big
impact on the experience we are trying a
new kind of presentation for these item
kiosk shops the user will go to the item
kiosk
he will pre select like I want to buy
items he will have for example his ship
loaded in automatically
he will then get to pick the item port
that he wants to actually make a
purchase for let's say a cooler
he will then see the one he has equipped
on that vehicle and then he will see a
list of items that are available on the
store every time he clicks an item on
the store he will get to see likes
sistex for that item how that item
compares to the one he has equipped and
also the availability to buy that item
to actually buy it and equip equipment
to the ship or to actually just buy it
and store it somewhere and do whatever
he wants to do with it the first thing
you'll do on a shopping kiosk is you'll
choose whether you want to buy something
or whether you want to sell something
because the sell functionality is gonna
be important for us going forward as
well the player could actually go to a
store let's say he finds a sweet deal on
let's say a couple of missiles and he
says like okay I have this couple of
missiles but I don't want to equip them
right now in my ship okay let let me
just store them somewhere and what we
call the global invent inventory and let
me just keep it there for a couple of
like days or so until I actually need
that the shopping kiosk is obviously
important for a mission and allowing the
player to access some of the things that
are currently outside of the game in the
game sort of in fiction but it's also
important for as one of the big first
steps for the economy Satan shops in
certain locations are gonna sell items
that potentially are made from materials
that are local so this is gonna tie into
the mind and system and everything so a
particular weapon is made from a
particular metal that is my noble
locally so that's gonna be kind of in
abundance at this location but it also
it might mean that they're cheap there
but it also means that maybe you can't
get them elsewhere where that material
isn't my Noble and then obviously the no
cons there are if I go and buy some
stuff from there I could potentially
sell it where it's rare you know the
kind of economy side of things really
kicks off when we start to look at
supply and demand of things like that to
that level so where we're at right now
is we've had our initial sign off on the
general flow and the functionality that
we mocked up in our prototype so it may
not be perfect off the bat but it helps
us to as artists and as engineers do
realize what are the exact requirements
how's this thing supposed to work and
how is it how does the how's it flow
it's all about kind of giving players
options it's speeding up gameplay
effectively it means that they don't
spend forever looking through different
menus it also really kind of helps the
new players so someone new to the game
might not know that they have to
physically buy something go into a
different app in the movi bus equip it
that way with this item kiosk they know
I bought this thing I'm equipping it to
this spot and it's done and it's all
simple and easy for them to use
so this release will have our first
iteration of the item shop kiosks you
know we're reflective of our prototyping
or art and implementation but it'll be
the first pass so right now we're at the
step where you can now purchase items
and it goes into your global inventory
we've also got the system working so you
can select an item port and it shows
rather than stuff to ship to by next
stop fours is to get shop items and what
you own side by side in a list so that
way you can see this is why I own this
is why I would be replacing and this is
what my options are in terms of future
development we will take a look at the
feedback that comes through from the
playerbase
testing the UI and our internal
usability testing as well so future
development will have future iterations
you know there'll be things that we'll
want to adjust and tweak in terms in
order to optimize the flow and the
experience in general so there are
things that we can't really force see
now and there and most of the time that
is the case but we've gone as far as we
can in the time that we've had allotted
and we we have a solution that we think
will work well but it really comes down
to how is the how does how is the player
ultimately going to experiences where
we're currently at is probably the most
exciting part is we have a
functionality already working so a
person can go into a shop can actually
see the items can actually buy them and
stay with them so it already makes the
call to persistency the fun part now
comes word we are starting to reskin the
item kiosks so instead of having that
kind of look and feel of the VMA and PMA
they're going to have their distinct
feel of like okay this is an item kiosk
it's gonna have like feeling in terms of
stores it's gonna have a slightly
different layout and the VMA then the
PMA it's gonna be familiar enough that
players know how to use it but it's
going to be a little bit different not
to just reuse assets it's gonna be
unique so to speak
thanks guys with alpha 3.2 not far away
we'll see further improvements to the
shopping kiosks in upcoming project
updates yes it's always a work in
progress big we have a whole bunch of
stuff that we need to do so 3 2 is going
to have the basics but we'll get to need
to improve in 3 3 and onwards because
shopping kiosks will be one way that
we'll be able to allow you to purchase a
lot of items that you may not always
have shop space for space for so always
be accommodation so the 3 2 will be the
first time you'll have a kiosk you can
actually buy sort of larger items than
we let you buy and most the shops now
and but it's a lot of work also due out
with 3.2 is the Vandal blade let's go to
jared huckaby for another installment of
shipshape taking a look at this menacing
fighter
greetings citizens and welcome to an
all-new edition of shipshape where we
take a look at what's making its way
down the ship pipeline towards release
into the star citizen universe
I'm your host Content Manager Jared
Huckaby now you might be asking yourself
hey I thought shipshape was a monthly
thing well it was but as with many
things the only constant in video game
development is change so we're gonna be
trying something new here over the next
couple episodes with a shorter more
refined by weekly format so what does
that mean for you guys what let means
you'll still get the same shipshape
content that you would have gotten
throughout the remainder of 2018 we're
just gonna chop them up into smaller and
more digestible portions so you don't
have to wait as long between updates I
know you want ships
I got shapes it's not my best metaphor
on today's division of ship shape we'll
be sitting down with some of the team
members in our winslow united kingdom
studio who've been working to bring the
sleek vanduul blade to life let's get
started by taking a look the blade is a
small single-seat fighter it's kind of
like the scythe but smaller whereas the
scythe has a couple of size five guns
the blade actually has four size two
guns instead it's just a little bit
smaller a little bit more easily
destroyed but at the same time it's
still got a vicious punch so you'd
expect from the Vandal essentially it's
the Vandal equivalent of the Gladius so
we have Vandal blade it's a very agile
single-seat fighter with four weapon
amounts to of size - yawns concerts and
gates a size 1 missiles on top 2
multi-purpose fighter really it's just
one of these smaller band duel ships and
they're supposed to be coming out of
maybe bigger ships
gets deployed by the kingship and the
idea behind me a plates landing
mechanism it's got the wings fold in
towards via cockpit and then there's a
panel that pops off underneath the wing
itself on both sides and then access
rear landing gear and in the back recipe
ribs which just fold out and revealed
the
landing gear in the back and just acts
as a counterbalance to the rest of it as
a voice just tip over
maybe blade authorizes very curvy
similar to the other vandal ships
curve sweeping in and out of each other
with lots of the animated elements and
some biomechanical influences like from
HR Giger it's as fast and aggressive as
Wendell ships tend to be it's also got a
fairly interesting profile where it's
almost shaped like the batwing it's got
this little u-shaped curve to it
basically it's just a fast aggressive
ship it's not particularly durable but
you know it's a bad guy so if you're
supposed to blow it up some of the
organic elements it glows pulsus
continuously throughout the ship - and
to give it a lot more life and then
immerse some animated ribs but open up
to reveal the landing gear I don't want
to call the profiles sinister but
definitely it's it's nothing that the
humans particularly their design their
tips for in addition to this it's got
this of accoutrements you'd expect from
the vanduul it's got like little spike
blades on the front of its wings it's
got some spikes on the back of the wings
where they're like vents just poking out
the back for little spikes coming out of
it it's a spiky evil sinister looking
ship with red glowing lights all over it
I mean very clearly you look at you like
that about go show the interior of a
blade is very organic and feels similar
to be exterior same kind of basic curves
going everywhere it's bit more intricate
as it's an interior it needs to be the
dashboard is completely hologram based
except for me
joysticks to steer the ship everything
else is just holographic
which gives it a bit of a distinct look
from the rest of the year it ships for
sure some rubber ships rather similar in
with lots of holographic I think me a
vandal stylus pushes that a bit further
one of the main things is how you get
into the ship with the Vandal ships you
have the seat which is kind of on a
runner and the Hat will pop down and the
seat will slide down to you and you grab
onto the seat and it'll pop back up
again taking you with it the blade has
exactly the same thing where even though
ships smaller we're trying to keep it
design metrics
you'll yell come down you'll get into it
you'll be able to go up and you'll sort
of rest on this seat rather sitting down
in a seat in the ship in addition to
that the cockpit area is don't call it
Spartan if I'm going to call it Spartan
there aren't it's not like it's not got
loads of screens in there like you'd see
with a lot of other ships the Vandal
kind of have like little hollow
predictors which will which display your
information for you and it's not
cluttered up with lots of screen stuff
it's cluttered up with evil bad guy
stuff so you know there's evil vents and
pipes and stuff everywhere but you know
that's fine it's also got a similar
flowing organic feel to the like the
structure between the glass panels so
rather than having like hard angles it's
all smooth curves which again handle
design philosophy we did follow the lore
of vandal quite closely and we actually
developed some new ideas while working
on it how do they actually make their
technology where does it come from how
does it run how does it put together
that's a quite an interesting way of
looking at vandal I think trying to move
away from portraying them as those
mindless just warrior like you know
frenzied creatures and then put some
intelligence and some interesting
aspects of the culture that make them
maybe a little bit more I would say
sophisticated but definitely not
mindless and quite intelligent and
purposeful in what they want to achieve
they are scavengers they don't create
their technology they absorb all the
racist technology and make do what they
want with it so so they are really
really capable in understanding how
stuff works and making stuff work for
them by modifying it and like combining
stuff together obviously they are not
like the visual aspects of their stuff
they don't care about that stuff that's
a wave like they don't have art they
don't have you know pop culture or
anything like that they just out there
to basically concur and absorb and and
assimilate and and then just be stronger
that's why their weapons they don't
necessarily have a consistent style per
se as you can very often see
some other races and some other
technologies inside for example see a
weapon that has a laser emitter that's
clearly based on biotechnology you can
see completely different lines
completely different style than to the
what would call von deuce vandal style
you can see some human stuff in there
because for example there was a battery
or or a generator that they really
really you know they looked at it they
reversed engineered it and connected it
to some other stuff and you know it
works and if it works that that's
already happy about everything is put
together using a some sort of bio
mechanical I what I call it I call it
paste but it's basically this is like
all the resources that they scraped and
and we find from the planets they
conquered they use those ships called
harvesters they just set them down and
they just basically take everything and
refine it and I create because I don't
think it's silicon I don't know we
actually really know what it is but it's
very very strong and and it has this
kind of biological look to it and they
basically put whatever the weapon they
wanted they put it together and then
they stick everything was like almost
like an outer framing so it don't
doesn't fall apart so that's like their
equivalent of our I would say welding so
all the kind of weapons and a lot of
their tech is surrounded by this
biological mesh or biological like a
structure or framing around so basically
it's stood and six together and you can
actually use it when I was talking to
Dave haddock our director of narrative
about it because when we create stuff I
don't personally like to create stuff in
vacuum I like to have explanation for
everything something that came up which
I really really like is is this idea of
vandal they don't build outwards like
humans would so human is going to get a
component and attach another component
on top of it and an another component
and it's kind of growing out like
outwards the vanduul like to do is they
create a shell a volume and they put
stuff inside of it so they call most
building inwards
that's why I
you can see a lot of weird pillars
coming in and holding stuff together in
a Midland and they kind of work like
that as people have seen the Vandal
changed quite drastically in looks we
had this very very noisy very very
grungy almost a scrapyard look to them
initially and that was how the first
wave of the concept art and a lot of the
models was created a few years ago there
wasn't necessarily anything very wrong
with it other than it was incredibly
inefficient and incredibly expensive to
run we wanted to to have massive fleets
and that's our goal to be able to run a
lot of those ships at the same time
almost like a swarm like formations so
we had to really really cut down on
polygons and that when Matt and Colleen
couple of years ago they created a
vandal driller the the big career of the
Vandal fleet in the new style with much
more kind organic and smooth curves we
followed that with other shapes and we
had to kind of pretty much to build a
ship according to that and that also
affected weapons you can see the old
style of vandal weapons on the some of
the ships that are currently in PU and
you can currently fly like a sigh and
glaive try to balance all the smooth
curves will be more spiky aggressive
shapes
it was also also the issue of scale
where Barristan feel about much you can
can use to to get the scale reference
for it verse variously cockpit of course
with the glass windows but having one
berth
there's not much you can really gauge
scale by one of the things with the
redesign was at one point there was some
experimentation with getting like a real
room where you could get out the seat
and walk around the back of it but at
that point the ship started getting a
bit too big it was starting to approach
the size of the scythe and obviously
being a life fighter that was making it
too big so that got scrapped to go scale
back down again a little bit essentially
the ship the core of the ship has stayed
the same for all the different
iterations the blade is still it's one
of the last ships we've made it has a
lot of the ideas what we want to do now
is we want to kind of go back again from
from blade duty driller to get all those
ideas
and then expand them over the whole
fleet again and just to add few more
things blade has a little bit of that we
want to create few more like common
bundle visual elements and maybe add to
it a little bit later and add to other
ships but it's probably the closest one
the closest ship right now that to what
we actually want bundle to look like but
it it might change a little bit visually
in the future obviously like anything
else is bound to change Reserve right to
change the stuff it's definitely not
final
we'll see what works it's very iterative
iterative process especially when you're
working on the whole fleet almost at the
same time which is kind of what I'm
tasked to do as a bit of life fighter I
mean it's gonna go in fast it's going to
fire a lot of guns it's going to Harry
smaller targets you might you might use
multiple of them in conjunction if
you've got like a bigger ship to try and
pepper it and take it down so something
else can come in and strike the killing
blow on larger targets it'll be your
general-purpose dog's body for fleet
it'll fight whatever you want it to and
it'll only give him a bit of a bad time
now I heard it a few scoffed at the line
it's like a Bandula version of the
Gladius remark but let me tell ya a
while back when we were doing those uh
electronic access imitations here across
the studios my boy Biddy Sinatra in the
QA department was mowing through the
rest of us so quickly he didn't even
bother to take the names and what ship
was he flying the Gladius now it's one
of the most exciting aspects of star
citizen's continuing development that
finding of an effective mix between
pilot and ship ships like the Gladius
and the blade can seem underwhelming at
times that folks like me who need every
single advantage they can get on the
battlefield in order to not you know
embarrass themselves but for those at
the top of their game and for anyone
that values speed or maneuverability
overall firepower ships like these too
often end up being just as devastating
as any other the bando blade is
scheduled to enter the persistent
universe in the upcoming alpha 3.2 now
also coming in that very same alpha 3.2
let's do a quick update on two ships
currently making their way through the
pipeline for
the aegis Avenger rework in progress now
it continues its development with EMP
tweaks work on the cargo room LEDs and
this look at the work being done on the
Avenger renegade library while the team
working to bring the stylish origins 600
idle life are making progress with the
captains quarters as well as a lighting
pass to what's being referred to
internally as the hub area now still
with plenty of work left to do on both
these ships it's exciting to see them
moving closer than ever before to their
intended release into the star citizen
universe with next month's alpha 3.2
content patch and that my friends is
what we have for you this episode but
don't worry cuz I'm gonna be back once
again at the end of this month with
updates on even more star citizen ships
more star citizen spaceship stuff and
more well everything that will make star
citizen the best damn space sim ever for
shipshape i'm jared huckaby
i'll see you in two weeks everybody
thanks jarred always fun to get a look
at alien ships yes it definitely is and
although designers have really locked in
on the style of the Vandal their ships
are becoming very distinct and very
threatening and cool-looking threatening
for more jarred tuned into reverse
AFER's live tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. PDT
and if you missed it on monday check out
calling all devs for more QA yes because
I also have Jared on it
and you can never have enough charity
yeah anyway so big thanks to all our
subscribers for sponsoring the show's
giving us this platform to share the
development process with all of you
tickets to citizencon are still
available and we couldn't be more
excited to share the development process
with you in person with a full day of
developer presentations and interactions
yeah well after last year being
successful we're going to expand the
format and there's going to be bigger
and cooler than before like basically
the UK ship department and all the ships
they ever do and it's gonna be a long
Center in Austin Texas which is also
very cool venue so we have a lot of fun
in store and can't wait to see hopefully
a bunch of you there and October for our
latest concept ship the Hercules star
lifter from Crusader industries we have
a short story contest running to give
all you aspiring lore makers out there a
chance to craft your own Hercules
adventure and win one for your fleet you
can't say that
I know seriously it's gonna be fun to
see all the creative uses the community
comes up for the ship it was always fun
seeing what people could do with their
Cutlass on 3.0 so imagine what it is on
a trip as big as the Hercules and also
thanks to everyone who participated in
our Intel screenshot contest these last
few weeks
congratulations - winner hosaka Marianne
n7 and captain rail rail who all took
home their own Intel obtain solid state
drives by capturing and showing some
spectacular in-game shots and I have to
say outside of the three winners there's
some amazing shots in the whole
screenshot contest every one of the
series there was three rounds had I mean
it was really hard - for me personally
to pick and I think a lot of the people
here at the CAG felt exactly the same
way so I would say people that haven't
gone to the screenshot contest you check
it out inspection because the in-game
photography that people are doing is
amazing and that's all for this week
thank you to all of our backers for
making this possible
until next time we will see you
