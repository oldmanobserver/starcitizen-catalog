everyone welcome to the show I'm mark -
he had to bring in it are setting up to
the bug smashers nope this one's a
splashers episode you know what kind of
time for this I'm going to my trailer
Wow
well since mark gaben so rudely didn't
ask this episode is about another
exciting insurance bug
let's get slashing alright so as I
probably said in the intro we've got
another insurance bug today this one
involving ships inside ships so as you
can see I've got my cyclone here very
tightly parked in the back of my Cutlass
this would happen with any ships but
this is specifically the Reaper case I
need to test so what happens if we make
a claim on this Cutlass when we have a
cyclone or an ox or any other thing
stored in the back we make a claim on
the cut list the ship inside or the
vehicle inside just gone forever
so to show you in the current state how
it looks when it's busted we fly over
here to this ESOP terminal and you'll
see I've got two cyclones
one of them is out on the pan the other
one is stored so there's two in there
we've got this parked out here now what
I need to do is go to Alice R and now
we're gonna make a claim on that Cutlass
and I'm just flying in here to save time
make it real quick
there we go one on Shubin make a claim
filed claim alright cool so that has
been filed we're gonna go back to ship
it and we're not gonna quantum travel
because we don't want this video to be
30 minutes
and voila there is only one cyclone here
so the one inside is gone forever now
really unfortunate so how about I break
down why this is happening
so you guys won't have to worry about
losing your ships so we're gonna hop
into the code here this is in the
insurance system and in fact this is so
four scroll up the function is process
claim to next step and we're
particularly concerned with this
callback that we have in here called our
entitlement exchange callback so there's
actually a different bug in the past
where ships that let me see if I could
recall this correctly basically ships
that you bought or added to your account
after a database have been set up
we're not insurable ships just so to fix
this problem we needed to have this
entitlement exchange where basically
we're like alright this old ship is now
the new one and switch all the web
information so everything is properly
routed so this is the final step of
insurance once we made this exchange and
to make sure that everything has
happened properly we will we now are
tracking two ships we have your old ship
the one that got destroyed or abandoned
or whatever and the new ship that
insurance is just given you so the old
ship we need to take this and say
legally no longer belongs to you when
you clean it up get rid of it because
you've got your new ship from insurance
so what we do is we do a change legal
owner for entity right here and we're
doing that on the old entity we're gonna
remove it from your legal ownership and
then for a good measure
if the ship isn't spawn this old one
we're gonna remove it right away from
persistance this is what we were
currently doing and this is why the bug
is happening is what we need to fix so
the crux of the issue here is if we
inspect a change legal owner for entity
we've got in our persistent data manager
we've got a couple things going on here
but basically if we change the legal
ownership of the ship we're also
changing the legal ownership of
everything
so all of the doors on the ship all of
the windows turrets everything that is a
child of the ship the legal ownership of
those things need to change as well so
like I legally own the ship which means
I also legally own all the stuff inside
so this is where the problem comes in
because the old ship still has your
cyclone in it we have now changed the
legal ownership of that cyclone to be
the universe it's not owned by you
anymore which is why it will not show up
in your ESOP terminals now technically
in the persistent database it is still
there but it is actually not not legally
owned by you there's several types of
ownership but that is the one of the
ESOP ternal cares about so we need to
fix this so if we hop back here we are
going to delete these two lines of code
here and there is one fun tonight
I have not filled out yet but what we're
going to fill out in this video so we're
gonna call this function called
clean up old ensured entity and we're
going to do that with the old entity ID
and we're going to do that with
contained oh I think I called it yes
okay
all right so if we inspect this function
here it should be totally empty because
we're going to implement it here on
camera
all right there we go so what we need to
do in this new function is similar to
before we need to change the legal
ownership of the old ship the one that
we're getting rid of that I no longer
own however what we need to do within
afterwards for every ship inside this
vehicle we need to loop or if every
vehicle inside the ship we're claiming
on we need to look at each of those and
then change its legal ownership back to
being the player because remember
because everything is like a tree
structure vehicles inside the other one
would get legally changed too so we're
gonna let them get changed and then
we're just gonna change them back to
beat the player that made the claim so
if I just bring up my reference code
over here the first thing we need to do
is grab a reference to our persistent
data manager
all right now once we have that there's
gonna be a couple things that we need to
do the first thing is we need to
determine if our ship has been spawned
yet
the reason this is important is because
there's actually two cases we need to do
different things for based on if the
ship is still around when we claim
insurance or if it's been despondent if
it's still sticking around in our entity
system
all righty
now the next step something that we were
already doing before and I'm just going
to copy and paste this for the sake of
time is we need to change the legal
ownership of the route of the old ship
we're already doing this before so it
still needs to be our first step here
but now that we've changed the ownership
we need to go back and change the legal
ownership for the ships that were inside
it so they still show up in our Aesop
terminal way we do that is we need to
loop over every ship that we have stored
by the way I didn't mention this earlier
but this this list here it's a vector of
contained vehicles this is actually Cota
added just before we started this video
but basically when we do a query earlier
up in the call stack we needed to grab
the vehicle anyway from persistence so
we just slightly changed that argument
so not only grab the vehicle but it
would grab all the items inside it that
are also of a vehicle type small change
I made before this just not showing it
in the video right now okay so what we
need to do is we need to iterate over
all these contained vehicles so we'll do
that here for the programmers in the
audience this will look a little weird
to you because I am setting this I to
start at one and the reason we're doing
that is because in this list of vehicles
the first one is the vehicle itself the
Cutlass so we want to ignore that the
Cutlass is not inside itself we've
already changed this legal ownership so
don't worry about that so we're gonna
start at one or start at I
and so what we're doing here is we're
changing its legal ownership of all of
the contained ships to be what their
previous owner was this will look a
little funny because it looks like we're
setting it's legal owner to what its
legal owner is that it's just because
this data is cached from before we did
this change up here so setting it back
to what it was before that's the
important thing
all right so this is really just the
core of what we needed to fix this bug
is just this little for loop here
however there is one other thing that we
need to do while we're in here in this
for loop we want to check if the ship is
D spawned and I'm going to copy and
paste this code just for sake of time so
we have one check if our ship is D
spawned now I mentioned before we have
different types of ownership in the game
legal ownership and physical ownership
for a variety of reasons we also want to
change the items physical ownership if
it's not spawned this is so what you'll
see in a moment so we're moving
persistent items parent we're gonna
change that and the reason for that is
after the for loop you'll remember the
code that we deleted you had before we
need to remove the old chip from
persistence only if it's D spawned so we
just tack that on the end here and what
this will do is it will not remove the
ship's inside the ships from persistence
it's let's see if I've worded that
properly your cyclone or your NOx or
whatever is in your Cutlass we've
changed the legal ownership however if
the ship was despond we were also gonna
remove it anyway with this code we had
this code before so we need to prevent
that too so there's really two things we
need to prevent here legal ownership and
physical ownership just happens to be
physical ownership in this case only
matters if the ship is not spawned
great okay so this is all of the code
we're actually gonna need to make this
work we just filled up this clean up old
ensured entity function and remember we
called that from the broader entitlement
exchange function back here so this is
really
last step of getting you a brand new
ship when you claim insurance so we're
gonna do now is we're gonna build what
should take about five years and I'll
get back to you then and we'll show you
this bug hopefully should be gone okay
so we're back in game now we've got the
cyclone in our Cutlass I'm gonna go
through the same repro steps that I did
in the beginning and we're gonna see if
hopefully we don't lose this forever all
right so we're just gonna fly over here
back to the terminal just so we could
show that we've got a yep we've got two
Cyclones there ones on the pad cool all
right
so we're gonna go to all sorry let's
make a claim
I'm stuck oh okay we're unstuck we're on
stuck damn hang on
keep this in keep this in all right
Justin oh god they say I pushed me
around okay
all right all right now we're doing it
um so here's our Cutlass right where we
left it let's make a claim all right now
now we now we see Shubin yeah Shubin
okay
all right and there's both of our
cyclones we didn't lose it forever so to
recap we needed to after changing the
legal ownership of our Cutlass we needed
to go in and look at all the vehicles
inside our Cutlass and change the legal
ownership of those back to our player
who owns the who owned the Cutlass that
way they're not lost forever our
insurance terminal and that about wraps
it up time to check back in with mark so
as you guys saw we had a fun little
insurance claim bug we're to ship in a
ship but unlike dealing with those pesky
insurance companies we just said hey
developer let's go fix it what aren't
you bad right yeah insurance no problem
1/6 the US economy solved the Atlantic a
few lines of code easy fix
done and done well hope you guys enjoyed
until next time
