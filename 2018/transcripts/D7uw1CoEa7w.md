hi everybody welcome to reverse the
verse live game dev edition we're back
in LA
I'm your host Content Manager for global
video production Jared Huckaby and we're
doing something we haven't done in a
while how long has it been since you've
been here on our teammates has it been
like maybe three or four months since
we've done it since we've had you here
we've prototyped gameplay that was I
think that was that was over a year ago
I was when the show was a happy hour
happy argument we have kx4 no systems
designer here in our Los Angeles studio
and every once in a while when he can
spare a little bit of time from from his
busy schedule we like to come in here
and do a different type of art TV where
we kind of explore the process of game
development now the star citizen as a
whole
is probably your single best resource
for behind the scenes of how game
development works between a TV and
calling all Deb's and RTB and happy hour
and 10 for the chairman and bug smashers
and lawmakers like that we like to joke
that by the time all is said and done if
you've been watching all the star
citizen's content from beginning to end
you'll have a 300 level class degree you
know in game development this is one of
those types of shows where we are going
to well why don't you tell us what we're
gonna do today kids well I'm going to be
prototyping out some gameplay I'll be
doing some stuff that isn't really set
down in terms of what what we're looking
for so we have this notion of research
in the game and there are some designs
for how that would work and today I'm
going to explore in prototype form one
of one of my designs for it
this is all very tentative of course and
not indicative of what we're gonna have
but it's more the fact that like I've
been thinking about what the the
gameplay for that could be and wanted to
play with it wanted to try it and so why
not prototype it the easiest way to know
now the backers who follow the project
are familiar with concept art for ships
and you know you come up with a concept
and then when it comes time to actually
build it out sometimes the ship can
change pretty drastically between
concept and reality even in subscribers
who have access to subscriber vault can
even see different concepts for the same
ship drastically different concepts in
much the same way designers concept
different game systems that you know
maybe maybe research will work this way
and then maybe it maybe a difference is
I know maybe research will work this way
yeah so for the ship design a lot of the
concept level design happens in white
box and well let's put it into engine
and actually walk around the place to
see what it feels like this actually is
probably better described as design
concept because even though I'm making a
prototype but it's I don't have a fixed
design that I'm working from what kind
of making it up as I go and so we're
gonna see what we end up with and
perhaps your most famous version of this
was a grabby hands yeah back when yeah
that led to that was the beginnings of
what would become eventually the
interactive system which looks nothing
like the thing that was exactly
originally but gave us a place to try
out a bunch of ideas see the things that
we wanted to achieve see the ways that
those things conflict with each other
given like actual use cases and start to
have a better understanding when we go
to actually make the full finalized
design of what is the problem we're
solving mention so while the DNA of
grabbing hands can be seen in today's
interaction system the one one look of
it is obviously very different what
we're going to be doing today is is a
similar prototyping of a potential
research gameplay it's it's not to say
that this
is what it will be when it makes in the
game but who knows that some aspect of
this may in may influence may it may
impact whatever the eventual design is
it may at the very least serve as
inspiration for things we do or don't
want to see this the types of
interactions that we want to see the
player doing or not doing and it's also
actually kind of a testbed for some new
of the new UI attack that we had that
lets me make screens and alter those
much much faster than before
so we'll do that before we get started
any updates on javelin basketball was
that the last one we had you on yeah
that's been asked the community we've
had caters on for a couple of these was
javelin basketball the last one some one
of you guys can I'm sure that YouTube I
looked into into doing the the air
hockey one was right I couldn't spare
enough I know we did try it we did try
to do one of these four air hockey for a
while then we forgot about that sometime
to come back to yeah it's amazing for
all of these that we do for every you
know every week is an RIT v52a years
several 50 about there are for all 50
that you we actually do there are
probably another 50 that we attempt to
do that we attempt to prototype that we
tend to get approve that we attempt to
see if we can make work and efforts to
the light of day that air hockey was one
of them all right so let's go to the
lumberyard and we can see our lumber and
we're here in our in our format made
famous by bug smashers yeah hi Mark
hanging out in there
we are the bug smashers today so you're
in the Arab League hangar lots of
reflections Angelo is that the the glass
sheet are going crazy yeah I this is
this is just a big computer so I'm not a
hundred percent sure the state of this
yeah well look at this wall this wall is
nice okay so I have started this a
little bit because there's a lot to do
for this idea just as a as a basic
overview of what I'm going to approach
for this is the idea is that you'll have
some artifact or sample or thing that
you bring over to your research station
and you'll put it in the box and from
there you will begin the process of
probing and performing tests on it
attempting to find out the its secrets
so to sort of in as those secrets is
basically a form of like mastermind
as near the classic game of like well
I'm going to try working rings yeah and
and find out how close I am and sort of
try to iterate my way towards a solution
I have referred guess who that that's
right in school I don't actually know
that one I'll try out general guess who
it do you have red hair
no and you put down everybody that does
the heads right oh it's a person wearing
glasses question yes if I get but do I
have that wrong was the name of the game
not guess who I don't remember all right
so to assist in this I wanted to also
like that's not the it's not the end of
the design I wanted to have it so that
we made it it's done here yeah once you
once you've determined what the secret
code is that you then need to figure out
how to achieve it I like puzzles that
have multiple tiers to the interaction
so this is an example of one of these so
we have four inputs here that get
shuffled as indicated by the lines and
one of them gets overwritten by
in this the color white and I'm gonna
represent the different values of the
sequence with various colors ultimately
we would also use various shapes colors
are easiest to iterate through because I
don't need to actually make the shapes
so I'll use that for now did you make
that circle and square I did it's very
impressive I know thank you I've got any
formal 3d art training actually a little
bit actually if you do have that
sculpting the sculpting clay and stuff
on your best I see you poppin so what
I'm gonna be making right now will take
you'll select sequence of four and they
will alter the previous state and and
iterate forwards so it looks like this
one ends up with white white always
actually so that this is a this will end
up with yeah all weights so I'll have to
create a results screen and a control
screen in order to alter the state of
these I don't have the other the other
test types currently so I I can take
input as to what that should be
so for the results screen so this is
data for here this is data Forge and
talked a lot about data for drove the
year um actually I let me bring in the
the control screen which I have started
this a maybe was asking why did you
start ahead of Titans because we only
have an hour yeah this is very few game
systems can be done also the tools that
I'm using are new and so they're not as
fast as they could be and so there's a
lot of just busy working in terms of the
way that I need to solve it it's all the
problem now that's right you're actually
talking right before we started the show
that one of the tools that you need it
was in the absolute latest build
and this build is from yesterday so it
doesn't have yeah the thing that you're
looking for it so I've made a thing
where you can select which one it is and
you'll see very quickly why I started
this ahead of time because I've only
done the selectable colors for this and
I forgot the Browns we'll have to add
that and I'll show you what that process
looks like let me see one of the nice
things that we have I think we mentioned
it recently was the a live update
feature which I will go ahead and cover
the screen with so hold on you make a
change in data Forge and it's updated
live inside the client yeah so I need to
get the canvas entities put down in UI
building blocks I've made the research
control screen so this is that thing and
[Music]
this is each of those and I have a
hundred different things happening on it
like yeah so you may order these before
we started the show yeah there is just a
certain amount of wrote input required I
didn't want to spend the whole time say
you're just doing data entry and this is
the data entry stream yeah so as an
example I would and we don't have the
ability to copy and paste in bulk right
now
so this is what that data entry looks
like so it's gonna be as exciting as
this although I mean frankly that would
have taken a lot longer it's a
I had to go through flash to achieve
even as long as this will take this is
drastically improved to how it's been
and then I'll just do that real quick I
said quick but that was a lie it's gonna
take a second so part of the idea with
doing it this way is that I want to be
able to I want to be able to tie
research in with the game at large if
that makes sense like this shouldn't be
its own corner of everything should tie
into the actual state of the universe
and so the idea for that is as mentioned
like you start off with samples that you
might get from planetside or derelicts
or things like that and that's let's ask
chat what what what's sample what are we
what are we going to be researching
today what did we find on an alien
planet today we don't have votes set up
like we like we have in the past I just
want to see some so you see some options
in twitch chat and I will pick out
whichever one tickles my fancy as it
were what are we what did we find on an
alien planet
what
so that's the the what they're saying
well it's not number one it might be
number two just put it that way
so yeah guy yeah we're examining some
some some alien alien alien poop hmm
thank you twitch chat perfect you came
through and just as we knew you would
before I go on with that before I fill
out those two it's not super useful
until I can actually change them all the
brown yeah so the way that I will do
that will be to use the interaction
state machine so love the interaction
state machine in this is the Select
screen that's correct in here we've got
the okay no this is wrong yeah control
screen why does why did I name it select
screen if that's not what that does oh I
know what that is
what are those days yeah so in addition
to the idea of picking out like like
doing the puzzle I really like what was
done with mining and I like the whole
aspect of like searching for the the
valuable bit of the things and so one of
the one idea that I'll prototype if we
have time is to start off with an array
of maybe 10 15 cells which could be
damaged and unaccessible
if the if the sample is compromised and
those would be the thing that you're
studying so you select one of those and
that will create the puzzle that you can
then solve to get the payout and to have
a sort of sliding scale of the value of
it so there will be physicians of high
value in it and if you find a high value
one you can you'll know that one of the
the nearby cells are likely of high
value it will interpolate between them
high value booth yeah well high value
information about this book oh yeah
you'll everything about you know where
they've been this is a creature that
eats everything it's just nothing so it
could be all kinds of interesting things
inside inside this poop and to my
superiors who I sold the concept of the
show to and said yeah yeah I mean yes we
are doing a show about alien Puna yeah
that's just how forward to your meeting
this happened notice okay so we are
about a third of the way through the
show by the way you sure that's why I
was so worried about this um so for
example we'll need to do check one read
this will be able I don't yeah we're not
gonna make it all the way through but
okay one of the reasons I like to do you
keep working with dr. Singh one of the
reasons I like doing shows like this is
because this is the kind of thing that
and this isn't a throw shade it if ei or
Activision or anybody else does this
show that no other game developer would
ever do they did it's like I said when
we make the joke about all of our
programming you know if you watch
everything from start to finish you know
you have a low-level degree in game
development it's I'm only saying that
partially and jest one of my jobs here
is to expose every aspect of game
development and designers are one of the
it's I think everybody wants to be a
game designer everybody what says I want
I want to make
I want to design games but very few
people have any idea what's actually
involved in that so when we get a chance
to do a show like this even though some
aspects of it are perhaps a little more
tedious than others with the data entry
and stuff it's a those are one of the
things I wanted to want to expose I
enjoy exposing so what I'm doing now
the way that the interaction state
machine works is when you perform an
interaction you will enter the new state
which will determine which interactions
you can actually trigger did that twice
and
so I'm setting up these interactions as
being valid when we're in test track one
I think I need to do one for each
actually because that will still trigger
the same in the other ones we'll just
treat this as easy as this and maybe
show us one
yeah we'll all have to do that so to
start with both of these have
interaction links which exists here
interaction links and I'm gonna select
that and on trigger red I need to give
it an interaction to set red so that is
this and here we have the default state
currently is white I need to create red
I don't actually have that so that
exists in the control screen result
screen and touch me
let's go find the test screen in the
navigator and I'm gonna use inheritance
this is the only way that this is even
vaguely possible to make just
essentially a duplicate of this and I'll
make some small changes to it so I'm
gonna switch
I should trigger red and then in here
oops in white I'll add an interaction
but I haven't added yet because it's
hard to talk well I don't normally talk
while I do this no it's a it's one of
the things that are most impressive
about game streamers you know people who
do stream on Twitch professionally and
as you know it's the ability to talk and
do something at the same time as
undervalued
in so many ways it's it's the toughest
are TVs for me to do are the ones where
we have to play the game and talk that's
why I always bring in like a little ice
bomb or somebody else to play the game
because I actually can't play and talk
at the same time well I'm sitting here
quietly trying not to distract you
[Music]
obviously okay obviously so I just I was
trying to figure out what state to go to
and I said it six times trigger read so
that'll bring us into this state at
which point we want to be able to go
back
trigger white which I haven't had it yet
either riveting I'm sure
one of the the things about working with
in development tech is like I don't have
this name yet and I'll get it when it
reloads but so you have to do a little
bit of working in the dark sometimes
okay so this should now be able to
trigger red and we'll see should I think
I need to reload that I'll do by
deleting it and bringing it back into
the game let's see the state machine so
currently it's in white it's still in
life so that didn't work let's
[Music]
I forget what it is
okay so to figure that out I'm going to
go to a test screen red which now it
should be in control screen and on my
button for a red getting trigger red I
know I didn't do meet you I just don't
want to spoil it I never changed this
target input - why does it only have
trigger white
in the current state that we're in so
they mean confirm which one that was
currently in current state white
trigger read should be an option
oh that's why I didn't make it so that
it was actually capable of doing the
thing I was asking you to do that sounds
like how the other day it worked for
having said that I didn't actually set
it up to do the thing okay
inching inching closer okay I'm gonna
make a light actually use lights a lot
to really they're easier to get to here
I use lights a lot to just trigger
interaction States because they're very
easy to see
bring it up
okay well when in doubt do it in flow
graph I'll create a new flow graph and
I'll bring it over cuz we also have
interaction that's the wrong one that's
the one to activate it
is interaction activated
[Music]
and if so we'll switch will toggle the
light on and off
let's see what that does
not triggering so let's see and oh I'm
not dragging anything around
it does not receiving that interaction
this is going as well as you know now
it's it's don't feel bad at all about
this this is this is exactly what I
wanted to showcase anyway this is this
is game 2 felony people often wonder why
developing games takes as long as it
does why it needs you know 50 60 70 100
200 300 people why we make something and
think it works and put it out into
testing and then find out it doesn't
work and we realist rating plenty yeah
must be fun we've had plenty of very
entertaining our TVs in the past this is
this one's more informational it's okay
you're doing great if I knew any way to
help you I would but I don't
okay so still doesn't have the
interaction listed just weird
Thanks
see I didn't think that I would run into
problems this early do we get I expected
there to be problems but expected
actually have things happened first
so this is this is boring let's not do
this okay I'm going to trigger that on I
made it I can make a little test debug
button on here that will have it change
its state and then we could at least
play out what should happen and so even
if we can't actually run the system yet
so to do that in Maine I have read and I
need to alter the UI graph so there's
like a connecting piece that
actually associates the
[Music]
component building block and this is
just green red and when we're in the red
state you want to use that and then I
want to actually do the thing I just
said and make it so that you can ever
actually reach that point in the world
so I made this run test button which is
apparently very premature because we're
not gonna make it to that and instead of
doing sets state to test status run test
I'm gonna do Maine red
[Music]
good news it didn't work one of the
questions of the chat says how much
freedom is KX have in doing things like
this is there normally a design brief
meeting this is for somebody who
probably wasn't here at the beginning
nope this is this is calyx running rogue
this this is him exploring how he thinks
say potential system should work like as
a concept somebody how we do different
concepts for different space ships and
this is also like something that I'm
doing for our TV Norma I would normally
have something a bit fuller before you
showing yes showing it off so I think I
need to restart this okay
do you regret ever doing me a favor now
I regret many many things do you have
regrets generally
this is that nice so what are we doing
right now we're exporting the binary
which should make the new graph change
that I made actually happen and running
the game again it decided that it wanted
to put the loading stuff on the other
screen so I'm gonna might move things
around be entertaining
are there any any questions that we can
we can actually talk about while I'm
flailing you do live fine man
questions
cold is finally gone yes I have a I have
a slight persistent cough cough but the
the problem with calling all dev is that
it's actually shot several days before
and whatnot so people you know I was
I've been fine for since last week it's
just you just saw a call there calling
all the devs that was shot when I was
sick so nice nothing although I think
about it that might not be wrong because
I made the new red but I didn't actually
change anything about it so before I had
asked what we should change about it
obviously the first thing to do is
instead of setting white red
Hey look it's right now
and the shuffle should probably be
different and which maybe we'll do it
out for track three out and then
honey any info anything no boy that
they're asking questions that are
outside your purview okay I'm gonna make
I make line to connect to this so
that'll be 250 that I conveniently
picked multiples of 250 line for 500
line 3 is fine
let's change line 1 750 so there now we
have a new thing right and to switch
between the two
I'll make a new button to test that out
folks in chat asked do you come up with
systems like this often all the time and
it takes a great deal of personal effort
not to make them constantly fortunately
they're time-consuming in my time is not
usually free so I end up just working on
what I'm supposed to but yeah I actually
really love doing this it's just a lot
harder to do in front of everybody
well it's only yeah it's only about 11
people yeah that's it right now it'll be
like twenty or thirty thousand on
YouTube though okay so now you can
switch between the two and if I got the
interaction state machine a bit working
you'd be able to do that from here so
that's something to look forward to
also I forgot that these are separate
screens which is why the red has that
anyway and so now the can be a little
bit clearer that the idea is that
like in this case you end up with just
white again whereas here you end up with
black black red white and so that is
just is sort of an example of how like
the making the order of operations
matter I think it could be an
interesting way of expanding on the
puzzle
basically because also one of the nice
things about that is that if we ended up
doing things like making the data that
comes out of this like of a certain tier
like like I don't know maybe you can
sell this data to science vendors and
that research data will move you towards
some like global goal right that'll
create some event to trigger and that
can in turn result in more of these
science module test processes to be
created at which point new puzzles can
be solved so there could be some that
you would only be able to solve up to
80% and you just have to accept that
you're incapable of solving this puzzle
and take a lower buyout or whatever as a
way to like scale things over time for
the given players experience I would
also want to set it up so that the
colors would correlate to like real
properties of the thing so like electric
objects or objects that are conducted
for electricity things that you see
glowing I don't know what would
frequently be blue green or white
included in their sequence so you'd have
an idea of where to start with that for
the people who have just joined this we
explained we were trying to do at the
beginning you want to give us a
dime-store recap on well I'm currently
just surprised that it didn't not work
it just works differently than I thought
so hey you like just turned off didn't
it yeah so I set up something different
than I thought I do but it's not broken
oh that's fine oh no questions which ad
is do you usually just jump into the
engine and start bumping around or do
you actually write the stuff out first
before I'll write stuff out I have I
have the notebook that this came out of
which it's just a bunch of like random
sketching of like the the idea that's
illegible completely incomprehensible
but I try I basically tried it out a
couple of times and like one of the
outcomes Jesus camera J so he can see it
oh you just switched where'd you go so
what one of the ideas was to have on top
of being able to do this system of
select for sequence types to figure out
what the outcome is that an additional
level of complexity for higher tier
puzzles would be that your four actually
duplicate so it's running a sequence of
those four and then running the first
two of the sequence the last two the
sequence and then all those four and I
end up with eight numbers so that's all
very confusing until you start actually
playing with it and it makes it
basically now you're playing three games
of Master Mind
so if this ever ended up being too easy
fear not it can get way crazier why
great who saves I saw the light on for a
while I'm gonna set up the does I only
said that that interaction one
directional and in fact probably doing
it in the state machine is my mistake
because the state machine is not aware
of what is happening outside of itself I
get that a lot
yeah well that's that's correct actually
it's the control screen one that needs
to have the state machine lose its
interactions
did you enjoy working in video games
before today I loved working on video
games
right on
there's something added here
it just
it triggered that time but I don't know
why
magic QA yeah exactly
hydrogen light off understand this thing
ran and I don't know why it failed to
run earlier so I think I'm going to
disable all of these and then there
should be no requirements for which it
is
this one also doesn't need any
interactions
although only to restart it
to me though being able to do things
like this is important to be able to now
it works
I lost my train of thought by being
surprised that my thing worked yeah
[Music]
I've completely lost my train of thought
what am i doing
what's a talk to us about the gameplay
situation where this specific mechanic
could work I know we talked we touched a
little bit on before so the idea is
generally that I I don't like when niche
gameplay is is constrained to being
niche game play if that makes any sense
I don't like it when the thing that
you're doing has no consequence outside
of the thing that you're doing so trade
and mining is really great because it
alters the economy it alters where value
is for pirates and people who are
protecting things and protecting you
from pirates and and also for the price
of things in various areas that X the
way that those things build on each
other makes it compelling to me so
having this able to link into having
artifacts that could be or samples like
that could exist in distant regions of
space that leads to exploration gameplay
the fact that those things can could
decay based on if they take damage or
maybe they are on a time limit maybe
they they need to be cold or something
and and they just decay naturally
j-jane spread and switch back to the
main camera so we're actually we're
actually out of time yeah this point JJ
so that's how hard it is to just make
stuff randomly you see JJ's not there
let this be a lesson to you ah well JJ
all right well we are after this is that
every once in a while you get one of
these that's okay though you you did you
succeeded in showing I'm not necessarily
what I wanted to show but kind of the
secondary objective which is that making
games is not easy well it also
demonstrates like our new tech a lot of
the things that we're beginning to use
like contrasting how long every step of
this took and how how easily it broke
this is a massive improvement and you
can kind of tell that from for instance
making the the white module versus the
red module like that was added
relatively painlessly I think and so
taking advantage of our inheritance of
data Forge taking advantage of the live
edit of our UI tools that taking
advantage of the interaction state in
order to actually trigger data flow and
and game flow between random objects
that I just tossed into the scene and
made earlier today those are all of the
most important foundational aspects of
making star citizen be able to exist in
the way that we wanted to so you know we
are wrapped up for today we do have a
couple housekeeping things that I'm
being told to share with you what not we
have another calling all devs that comes
this Monday just like it does every
other Monday a citizen non tickets are
of course still on sale and last week we
have a follow-up to last week's OCS
themed reverse the verse I'm being told
that I can tell you that our intention
is to go to evocati in the evocati is
the first wave PTU early next week of
course it's going to be it's going to be
depending on when the build is ready and
whatnot but
you're actively aiming towards early
next week to be to get the first builds
of three point three point three into
the hands of our evocati test flight
something a little different that we're
doing this time because three point
three is potentially our biggest patch
yet if you watch the OCS a strain last
week you heard about how OCS is touching
every single aspect of star citizen like
things that have been in and untouched
since 2.0 had to be revamped for the new
object container streaming it's like
that so everything gets touched because
of this for the first time in our
development we are going out with two
parallel PTU builds there will be a
three point three that has OCS and a
three point three that does not have OCS
so when you hear about that next week
when when that happens you know what
that that's coming that's an effort for
us to basically basically cover all our
bases and figuring out where bugs exist
in one and where bugs don't exist with
other it servers request by our
development team and we think especially
if you watched last week's RTB the
reasons for that are very very apparent
so expect that hopefully early next week
to parallel 3.3 builds coming to ebay
cable Connie next week and then of
course to PTU and then of course towards
our targeted release with excess essence
and God so yeah so that process is
starting real soon
I've KX I think I figured it out yeah so
I do need to have like for instance
trigger to read and that needs to be in
double and linkable and trick to white
Thunderball in like a moment and then I
need to trigger oh wait no that's not
gonna work either
I mean I got I got the white one working
I'm Charlie Brown in here Lucy with a
football you know that because I have
you can go back and forth oh there you
go
I still have the light hooked up so
that's pretty so actually everything but
you got around it trying to do is
actually working at this point yes and
then I wasn't he done I would need to do
that to all of them now so games take
time game take time we are that that's
we're renaming that episode so I kind of
finally come back next week you got
