## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm sandy Garner and
I'm Chris Robbins this week we'll take
our usual look at the road map with a PU
project update take a deep dive into the
continuing development of service
beacons and welcome bug smashers to ATV
yes so more on that later now let's go
once more to ricky gently for this
week's Tarsus and project update thanks
guys let's kick things off at the top of
the roadmap first let's check back in on
characters more progress has been made
on the legacy armor sets throughout with
the release of 3.2 and some new mission
givers and shopkeepers have animation
phases wrapping up moving down the road
map into gameplay shopping kiosks
continue to be tweaked from the UI and
player experience to their physical
design these rough work-in-progress
clips show the progress being made on
the flow and working path for the kiosks
eventually there'll be several unique
designs for the kiosks with specific
looks and branding audio continues
testing sound design for the different
functions and faces of the mining
mechanic we can hear different effects
for the laser itself and the rock being
destroyed as you can tell the sound
element is going to go a long way
towards enhancing the mining experience
ramping up the anticipation and ending
with a satisfying payoff the effects
have started work on visual additions as
well and here we see tests being done to
see how the effects differ depending on
whether or not the mining attempt is
successful in that first clip it seems
the laser is off target or something
went awry we can see in the second clip
how a well-aimed mining laser created
minimal blowback from the rock the
effects have also been working on some
R&D for chien ship explosions and QT
effects we made them with the new GPU
kill noise functionality which allows us
to apply a distinctive visual language
to all chien effects
previously we had to
make this wispy ethereal style into
textures but now we're able to make use
of high particle counts to achieve ideal
visual clarity the ship teams have been
working on several vessels to become
flyable in 3.2 and others that will be
unleashed in subsequent releases work
has been done on the EMP capabilities of
the Avenger warlock and the
constellation Phoenix is currently in
final AR with passes being made on its
many bells and whistles including the
fish tank and the hot tub ship teams
have also been working on improvements
to already flyable ships as seen here
with adjustments to the animation for
the star ferries landing sequence the
props team continues to turn our hangar
props like this repair drone these
extractors and this large machine sledge
these props will comprise a set that can
ultimately be mixed and matched to
create a sense of realism two hangars
and other blue-collar settings
throughout the verse and speaking of
hangars and space stations procedural
layout work is ongoing as more passes
are done on various configurations to
see what looks good with lighting and
set dressing and what still needs to be
added or adjusted the environment our
team is also implementing seals notes to
add more variation in terms of shops
signage and material swaps more work has
also been done on the hangar elements
for modular stations as NPC stand-ins
props and other kinetic objects are
being tested the goal is to make the
spaces buzz with activity and feel lived
in the rest stop exteriors are also
looking good with the team awaiting
delivery of advertising graphics from UI
at which point they'll be able to
replace the work-in-progress ones
environment r has also been testing the
visuals and procedural generation for
biomes and environments that you'll find
on the planet Hurston and its moons in
alpha 33 while identifying natural
points of interest where gameplay will
take place here you see some tests being
done on the dense forests and how
they'll fit into the topography of the
planet a placement tool has also been
developed to assist the live design team
in placing outdoor locations and a
footprint validate
tool has been implemented in order for
designers to predefined what they want
to do spatially with a specific location
its back-end tools like these that will
make live design and implementation much
easier as a team populates planets moons
and more with structures and viable
points of interest for gameplay finally
looking to foundational core tech work
for upcoming releases planet tech
continues to receive enhancements some
of which we may see an alpha 3.2 some of
these improvements include increased
channels to allow for more complex
biomes and integrate my noble entities
into the environments improved color
tinting and soft blending which will
lead to better integration of objects on
the terrain that's it for this week
we'll have more updates next week now
back to you in the studio thanks Ricky
remember to check out the public road
map on the RSI website where you can
follow along with PU development
yourself yes it's cool to see so many
gameplay improvements coming along as
much of the focus 43.2 has been put on
them one of the gameplay elements were
currently working to improve and expand
our the service beacons
yes making their debut in 3.1 service
beacons represent the evolution of
player created missions in the game so
let's take a look how the devs have been
implementing the system and continue to
improve on it in this week's feature
the surface beacons are player generated
missions and we wanted to give the
players the opportunity to interact with
each other on a level that most mmo's
don't really do you know a lot of them
have PvP but this is like I've taken a
mission that's that's too big for me to
do so I want to give other people an
opportunity to help me with that at a
conceptual level the service beacon is a
mechanism that allows players that want
something to easily form a short-term
contract with others that want to
provide it this is a much more important
feature than it might initially appear
because it effectively means that we're
leveraging the player base to supplement
and enhance the scripted and systemic
content that's available within the game
while at the same time because other
players are involved injecting a very
unpredictable element that's ultimately
going to result in a lot of very unique
gameplay experiences just as importantly
by constantly pushing players together
when they've got compatible interests
the service beacon is going to help
foster the creation of relationships
within the community and that in turn
will lead to the formation of a lot of
new friendships alliances and in the
case of deals gone bad sometimes even
than debt --is so three point one laid
the architectural framework for all of
this functionality and introduced the
first couple of beacons and you can now
hire other players to defend you or ask
them to transport you wherever you want
to go but this is really just the tip of
the iceberg in terms of where we want to
take this system we're aiming to push it
a lot farther in the future you go in
through the exact same same way that you
would do any other mission you open up
your mission manager you have a beacons
tab so if you want to generate a new
beacon for somebody else to take you
need a service then you can go there and
create a new beacon select the beacon
type fill out the parameters it's really
simple right now fill out how much money
you're willing to pay either combat
assistances is by the minute or you know
the personal transport is just a one
lump sum payment and create a beacon and
you can respond to it directly through
that
or you can actually go into the mission
manager and go into the general tab and
other players missions show up under a
beacon header in there for the UI side
we figured it made the most sense to
utilize the existing mission manager
screen to implement these new features
so along with our mobile ass overhaul
that we did to expand the amount of
realistic real estate the mobile glass
took up on the screen we factored in the
service beacon creation screen our goal
with the with the UI on the beacon
creation screen was that it would be
fairly kind of self apparent as to how
the player would interact with it there
was very few pieces of information
needed for the player they need to know
what kind of beacon they'd want to
create and then based on that other
elements would turn on in this case all
want to go somewhere well where do you
want to go we need to give that to the
player if you're wanting combat
assistance that information is not
needed so we would need to turn that on
and off as applicable and then validate
everything is correct that you have a
price you have a reputation request you
have a location and then send that off
to the code so we had to lay out the
different dropdowns make sure that they
would work out correctly there just so
that when you look at it it's not we
don't have to do it to Tory I'll have to
explain how this work you see it it
makes sense and you're able to just run
with it that was the core goal of the
way we ended up setting up the UI also
making sure we're going to have
additional beacons going forward and
when we do that we want this system to
be able to easily adapt add in or change
out modules in there as needed and just
be able to punch these out from a UI
standpoint relatively quickly compared
to the initial framework setup so in
designing the service beacon system we
implemented a rating system where
players can be rated both on how they
provide the contract and how they
actually execute the contract so both
sides also players are rated on a per
contract type basis so essentially for
example you are very good at doing
personal transport type of contracts
however you may not be so good at combat
so you have different ratings for both
of those so it doesn't make sense to
have and kind of like this overall
rating because you could be
really good at one thing but not so good
at or another and so we have that split
out so as a requester of contracts you
are able to specify what the minimum
rating is for people to accept your
contracts so person with a two-star
rating won't be able to accept your
contract if you specify that as three or
four stars so right now you can't as a
requester of contracts as a person who
configures a contract you can't
necessarily see the writing of the
person who is accepted the contract as a
as a as a player who accepts contracts
you are able to see what your rating is
compared to what the minimum rating of
the contract is so contracts that are
higher than your rating won't show up in
the mission manager yeah so you can't
see a 4-star contract if you're rated at
only three stars
another thing we had to set up is the
missions need to show up to other
players so once I create the beacon it
gets broadcasted out and another player
would see it show up on their mobile
glass through the existing mission
system we already have a lot of that
happening but we just needed to expand
that to allow these player created
missions to also be picked up and
broadcasted to the rest of the mission
screen which is why when you go in you
can see when you go to the beacons tab
it shows other created missions that the
player is able to select and are the
ones you've created to cancel out and
then in active ailable missions you can
see which missions players have created
and you can accept those just as though
it was any other mission so we're using
the players ingrained knowledge of how
the system already works and letting
that drive how they interact with this
right now our existing notification
system is a little bit rudimentary it's
it only handles single strings and
there's just a simple queue for those
messages but later down the line we want
to introduce signers the control to be
able to push in notifications that
require and like an accept or decline
action or a mission objective which has
a timer and different note types of
notifications would have different ways
of being presented on the screen and
transitioning off the screen to be able
to visually associate with other HUD
elements
so for instance a mission objective that
comes on would flash on the screen for
maybe a second and then that would tuck
away in the direction of where you have
a persistent note a objective list on
your on your HUD so we want to have more
visual association with those
notifications so it's easier to see what
they apply to basically expanding the
the capability of the notification
system so we don't have to have a hacked
you know cept only separate layer of UI
we it can all just factor in the same
thing when we created the personal
contract beacon and the combat is to
speak and we had to make different game
rules to make those things work so we
had to think about the logic that needed
to be implemented and what I mean by
that is that what does it mean to be
successfully transported from one
location to another I need to be picked
up I need to be detected within the
bounds of somebody else's ship I need to
be successfully landed at the
destination that I chose and so we want
to try and make it so that these things
our players can't exploit the system so
as we move forward you know we're gonna
make it so oh well combat assist you
actually have to be within a certain
range of somebody in order to be
considered you know assisting them if
you're across the universe that you're
not really helping me out right so as we
go through these different contract
types and the different beacon types we
we really need to make sure that we we
catch all of these edge cases and try
and put in some game logic that really
focuses on removing those exploits from
from the system so tailoring each
mission and each beacon type to what
they really need and and how to get
those exploits out that's really
important to us so it really enhances
the player experience and it gets rid of
some of the trolling that that can
happen in in some of the MMOs that you
see out there these servers beacons are
part of a new class of features that
were making in the game
are really leveraging the services
technology that we're writing for the
backend and what this allows us to do is
write game features that can communicate
with players that will be in the future
across several server instances and this
is a requirement as we look towards a
feature where the game is actually
running in a server mesh so not the
entire universe or solar system even is
running on one server and said we have a
mesh of servers that are kind of running
the logic and simulation for regions of
this space so because of that we need to
write some kind of infrastructure that
allows game play game flow to occur even
with players that are across these
different server nodes and when they may
traverse the bounds of the different
server nodes and so this adds some
interesting complexity to the
development process but also a lot of
excitement I think as well the interface
for the service beacon is going to
gradually evolve in a number of
different ways cosmetically
notifications are going to become
diegetic so that the presentation of the
information doesn't rip you out of the
game reputational feedback that's gonna
expand from a simple good bad rating to
a more flexible 5-star system that will
allow you to more precisely rate the
other party we're also gonna add support
for hotkeys so that you can do things
like quickly and easily dispatch calls
for combat assistance when you're under
attack and doing everything you can to
evade enemy fire now you can already
limit your interaction with other
players based upon their reputation and
we're going to expand that system to
allow you to limit your dealings to just
those players that are friends or
members of select organizations one of
the the most interesting upcoming
features to me though is going to be the
ability of the system to record a
variety of stats relating to the
providers performance and give you that
feedback in real time so combat escorts
will have things like their hit ratio
and kill percentage tracked personal
transports will record things like
elapsed time and average speed and fuel
suppliers will have their transfer
efficiency monitored this information
will allow you the employer
to more effectively determine when and
whether to terminate a contract as well
as what kind of reputational feedback
you eventually want to give right now
the service beacons are just factored
into one category that you see on the
mission screen and to actually create
that beacon to create a player generated
mission B we implemented a new tab for
specifically for service beacons in
which you are able to view all of your
beacons that you have created previously
and you are able to have a form to
create a beacon as well so right now
it's very basic you can specify the type
of contract basically there's only two
types at the moment and you have will
specify a location and a price however
later down the line we want to massively
extend this to be able to configure it
in various way so you can set up logic
like you know pay a certain amount if
they've done a certain task or whatever
so there's gonna be a much more robust
functionality later down the road for
creating contracts we're going to expand
the system to allow some contract types
to support multiple multiple providers
so for example if you want a combat
escort to tag along and protect your
valuable cargo as you make a run through
a particularly dangerous area of space
you'll be able to specify how many
higher slots are available for that
particular job with each provider
working as an independent contractor
towards that common goal another big
change is that NPCs are going to gain
the ability to interface to the service
beacon and what this means is that over
on the employer side this is going to
help us inject a lot more life into the
world
so based upon what the back end
simulation dictates we'll be able to
ensure that a given area always has the
right mixture and quantity of contract
jobs on offer and players can elect to
respond to or ignore those opportunities
however they see fit and over on the
provider side NPCs will do their own
mental calculus to determine whether the
reward offered justifies the effort and
expense and if so then they'll compete
with players for those opportunities and
what this means in the long term is that
be able to guide prices for these jobs
into a reasonable range and also ensure
that we've got the ability to fill in
the gaps within MPC when players aren't
willing to step up perhaps because there
aren't any in that area or maybe because
they're just doing they're just busy
doing something else we're currently in
the process of working on several new
types of contracts with escorts slated
to be the next one out of the gate and
it's going to combine regular payments
with quantum linking so that you can
travel anywhere as a group another
interesting one is assassination which
is going to allow you to put a price on
someone's head and introduce the concept
of multiple providers vying for a single
prize the point of interest beacon is
going to take things in a slightly
different direction and allow
information you've discovered such as
the location of a derelict ship that can
be salvaged or rich to positive war that
can be mined to be shared or sold to
others refuel and repair those will come
along a bit later along with the
associated gameplay and eventually a
number of other contract types at the
beginning of the system and and it
should be it some players are already
you know talking about it and having fun
with it so it's pretty exciting
so as service beacons continue to be
improved and expanded in 3.2 and beyond
these player crated missions will become
an integral part of the star citizen
experience fleshing out the universe
adding a lot of variable content and
unpredictable situations for players as
mentioned earlier bug smashers is
joining us this week as a segment here
on ATV without further ado let's give
our resident bug smashers general mark
abent
a warm around verse welcome take it away
hey everyone welcome to bug smashers
I'm your host mark David let's get
smashing
look spacious everyone we're here in my
fancy dancy well not test map but
portholes are one day I'll get renamed
depart port bug Smasher and we've got a
fun little bugs where supposedly when we
spawn ships all of our weapons fall off
so I'm going to spawn my favorite ship
the Cutlass
mostly because I could type cut and it
spawns and I'm gonna zoom around you can
kind of see my guns just floating around
in space because they're like I don't I
don't like you anymore I'm just not
gonna be part of my part of your ship so
I could fly away there called my
missiles and yeah apparently this is
happening and all of the game you know
you come in one day everything's fine
come in the next day and all your guns
and missiles are flying off your ship
alright so let's see what is happening
this was a very weird one and it caused
a lot of confusion because well this
makes enough sense and one of the first
things we were looking at and what was
happening is looking at the server
console and we were finding where is it
somewhere in here so many things I
thought that the way go down console
doesn't even show it anymore
whew it's showing other stuff oh oh
there it is we're seeing there is any
component Network set network parent and
what this is basically is saying is if
we have a gun and we have a turret and
we have a ship the parent of the gun
should be the turret and the turrets
parents should be the ship but what this
error is saying is the the back the
mount or the turret is not yet bound to
the network so the gun cannot be
parented to the gun so its parenting it
to the ship and this is bizarre because
the ship's supposed to spawn then the
turret
and once the turns bounces a network and
then we spawn the gun it's this whole
batch system that we have to make sure
things come in the right order and we're
getting Network spam saying well that's
not happening so let's go to ha this set
Network parent will put a breakpoint on
there and see what is happening let me
get out of my fancy dancy ship and will
spawn inside of another color so Zam we
got the debug alright looks like we just
hit it take a look at the call stack and
we are to do aha
so we're spawning the entity then we're
spawning a bunch of the item ports and
then that's calling more things to spawn
but the interesting thing is in this
spawn entity function we are going
through this top level instead of this
bottom level now this top level is meant
for as you're loading in the game as a
client
we just spawn stuff directly while this
bottom level was meant for if I'm
spawning a ship a turret and a gun we
put them in a batch so that they spawn
correctly in order and we don't spawn
the next thing until well it's already
however we're bypassing this and the
even stranger part as is this bit where
it's called is loading screen active the
loading screen is not supposed to be
enabled on the dedicated server in fact
it should never be enabled because that
means we're loading UI code on the
dedicated server so what I'm gonna do is
go into the bit of code that turns on
that duel and if we're the dedicated
server we shall basically cause a debug
break so we can see what's turning it on
all right so let's compile the code and
give it a try
all right code got compiled let's start
up the dedicated server and see what's
enabling the background screen which
should not happen if you do start up
superior level should hit a breakpoint
one day - aha we hit it so let's see how
we're doing this huh it's interesting
enough we're hitting it from the loading
screen so yeah it is the UI so when the
UI gets enabled it sets this background
screen and I guess it's just never
turning it off because well the server's
not meant to be doing any of this so
what we're gonna do is look for where
all the UI gets created aha
down here so we have the global game you
ID the front-end and then the menu
screen pause what we're gonna do is move
this a bit of code into here and what
this will make sure is that if we're
running the dedicated server we're not
going to run some UI code so it won't
turn on the background loading so that
the swon system will spawn correctly in
the batches and then everyone will have
their amazing weapons on their ship so
let's give that a compile and see what
happens
all right to remove the magic we are
back at port olisar with the new
improved compiled code so we will spawn
they an amazing cut list and see what
happens
this time I have to go into it
into the amazing pilot seat and I still
have all the guns attached to the ship
sweet so if I fly out out of the green
zone I should be able to go pew pew pew
warp speed there we go so all my guns
and missiles are still attached and
everything's back to how it should there
you have it UI code causing shenanigans
on the dedicated server guys like that
one so as you guys saw we had a fun
little incident where all of our weapons
were falling off and that's a little big
thing and funny enough it was because UI
code was loading in the background
dedicated server when it shouldn't have
setting some bool the true and that the
earth I'm sorry the spawn system was
checking to see if it was the client
spawning and it caused havoc which
bypasses the spawn batch so things are
spawning incorrectly and is a whole big
mess luckily this is the stuff we have
to deal with as a gameplay programmer
and all we had to do is just shut off
the UI loading code and ettiquette
server everything was good to go hope
you guys enjoyed until next time
thanks mark smashing as always iterate
sister
most definitely you still have a few
days to enter our Intel screenshot
contest nary an m7 took the top spot in
round 2 by capturing this inspiring
Vista check out spectrum for a closer
look at all the entries and your chance
to win your own Intel up teen 900p
solid-state drive yeah and there's been
really some pretty impressive shots
submitted so far you can check them out
on the spectrum forums and I'm looking
forward to seeing round three tickets
for citizencon
are now available we look forward to you
joining us on October 10th at the Long
Center in Austin Texas for a full day of
presentations interactions and fun yeah
we're gonna be bringing everything you
loved about last year's event back and
building on that foundation it's a
really beautiful venue and it's going to
be great bring Sue's and come back to
Austin where it all began you can find
all the details and purchase tickets in
the comm links section of the website
and while you're there check out our
newest concept ship the Crusader
Hercules yeah you saw it featured last
week on shipshape and this ship is
definitely a brute the ability to
transport ground vehicles small ships
and massive amounts of cargo that's all
for now tune in to this week's new
calling all devs for answers to
questions about pretty much everything
related to flight control and this
week's reversal was live will feature
more on service beacons so get your
questions in thank you to our
subscribers for sponsoring our shows and
we hope you're enjoying those new
exclusive ICC edition weapons and of
course thank you to all the backers for
supporting the development of star
citizen and squadron 42 yeah and
remember it's Mother's Day this weekend
in the US and I think in Germany too so
don't forget to call your mom she's
probably always wanted a Hercules a2
gunship if not sell for some flowers
yeah and until next week we will see you
around
