## Transcript

hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse i'm sandi gardiner
and i'm chris roberts this week we're
excited to bring you a special feature
on squadron 42 yes so back in a holiday
show we showed the vertical slice and a
first look at the coil and menacing
massive planet fragments and static
electrical storms it's a very unique
environment that pose some distinct
technical design challenges yes this
month we're only taking a closer look at
the coil since our teams just recently
got back from the holidays but going
forward our monthly updates for star
citizen and squadron 42 will include
detailed project reports along with one
or two features let's check in with the
devs now on the coil what is the coil
it's a huge volumetric thing out in
space it's a thing that you have to be
able to fly outside to look at these
thing you have to fly inside to be to be
surrounded by I think you fly through
through bits of it a technical nightmare
it's all it's all manner the coil was
was sort of a fun element in squadron 42
because it was basically this sort of it
plays a big role in sort of the
character of the system that it's in so
the story being that in Odin system I
think it was actually by the time by the
time that the UE II had discovered it
the star had already gone Nova and so in
the sort of the blast it decimated the
first planet and for whatever reason it
created this sort of like perpetual I
say electromagnetic because that's the
first adjective that pops in my head but
sort of electrical storm of you know
chunks of planetary fragments and you
know just gas and energy and all those
sorts of very weird things and so it
created this sort of
you know perpetual labyrinthine storm so
the idea being that there are these sort
of tunnels that you can fly through it
that you can say if we navigate but if
you hit sort of what we call the walls
but they're not really physical the
walls of the coil it's it will
overcharge your ship basically and fry
you to death and so it created this
interesting dichotomy of with these
planetary fragments a lot of really cool
stuff that you would normally not be
able to mine like being able to actually
mine the core of a planet and and stuff
like that and so it created a kind of
unique opportunity for more risk risky
mining consortiums to basically like
take the plunge and you know travel
inside the coil to try and get access to
this sort of the potential vast
resources that could be in there but it
was extremely dangerous and the sort of
the walls like I said of the coil shift
so theoretically where you're mining
could seal up and you could be trapped
in there but the danger of it also was
really appealing to sort of the criminal
element who knew that sort of the cops
basically would be too scared to try and
follow them in there so they would use
the coil as basically a den to hide out
in and launch rates and then come back
in know that people probably wouldn't
follow them in there so that was sort of
the original guise of it and so so yeah
I became a big part of the squadron 42
story of creating this environment that
the player has to kind of Navin while
sifting through this story if you build
in any kind of conventional game
environment you've you've always got
clear direction oh you've got clear
reference you know I wanna mountainscape
in there or oh I want my base are pirate
elbows to look a certain way but when
you're building something this abstract
the the concept and the idea it can go
through a lot of iteration and that's
where we've gone from there well what
we're looking at now is that exploited
planet feel so when you when you see it
for the first time in the system you
should be able to see the kind of the
big chunks of planet in there you should
be able to almost
quiz engineer it in your own mind about
where this where this idea is come from
on the outside and the intro to the game
everything is kind of peaceful a little
bit tense and mysterious your game can
like really kind of wispy edges and
things like this but as soon as you
start to kind of like probit steps a bit
more kind of like routine kind of
mysteries out and things like that you
started to get kind of like more violent
it's closing in on you getting more
claustrophobic and kind of it doesn't
want you that it's pushing you away and
things like that that kind of like lends
itself really well to storytelling just
through the environment itself
traditionally in a lot of level design
you'll have these really big
recognizable forms that you can kind of
see from any direction just gonna keep
you grounded in the world and know where
you're going and when you're working
with a big cloud or that kind of thing
it's really difficult so I sculpted
these these big bold shapes and things
like that and we started come at
recognizing things that I think
internally started naming some of them
and we had like the claw and the horn
and all this kind of stuff or named
after the devs there's not many games
that can render as as far as we can we
call it zero render distance so there is
no kind of boundary it's yeah if you
think about kind of floating through the
clouds in the plane it's pretty much
that on a huge scale it needs to to do
several things for gameplay for design
and obviously for Chris's expectations
as well on the visuals volume metrics in
3d software hardware generally are very
difficult to achieve even offline
rendering if you start to enable sort of
fog or clouds or or anything like that
it becomes a hugely memory intensive so
yeah it's it's it's a huge challenge to
do this stuff real time
and to be able to kind of fly around it
the trouble is because this is a volume
it's not even this it's not even like
having a really large 3d object it's
like if you did it in a naive way you
would actually need to full like a voxel
for every square kilometer or cubic
kilometer I should say so yeah any any
time you try and turn up the resolution
on it a little bit suddenly it costs
eight times as much memory it's gone
back and forth through a few different
sort of technological
approaches for a while we were very
focused on getting very very hard walls
the cost of at the cost of the
fluffiness so we were going to be able
to have some softness but it was going
to be a very clear distinction between
like hazy stuff and rock-solid stuff and
that worked for some of the interior
scenes but it was also we haven't really
whydid up to to any third-party tools so
it was very limiting experience for the
artists and they didn't have a quick way
of iterating on it so that didn't work
out quite so well since then we switched
to a format called open V DB that's I
think it was developed by DreamWorks
originally for doing foggy type stuff
but conveniently that's that's quite a
common output format from a lot of
third-party tools so it kind of lets the
lets the art teams chop and change
between exactly how they want to get the
asset to the engine and then then we
just have to pick it up and convert it
into our own format internally when we
started doing the coil we started by
using fume effects to simulate these
large cloud volumes but we quickly found
out that doing this using fume effects
would take a long time to iterate upon
and that the results we would get would
vary drastically between each setting
that we changed we thought that this
would be a bad method to actually is a
iterate upon in the future so we started
using Houdini
so in Houdini we started with this large
source object here which the environment
art gave us we converted it to a volume
and cut shapes through it and we can see
that by looking at how it is as a 2d
representation of the volume
and so the whole process basically
allows us to take this step by step and
iterate upon what we've made very gently
and very non destructively and by
applying different noise to various
stages we can create lots more
interesting shapes that you see we're
also able to merge two different graphs
together so we have the main graph which
is that large dominant shapes and then
there's a subtle Ward shell that we put
on Indy which we mix together to create
more interesting coil so this is the
shell we're seeing we also have this
haze which is the gentle stuff which you
fly through and picks up the light and
then we mix it together and we sample it
to create better quality at the end this
allows us to have the final version of
the of the coil
you can see here that different colors
represent the different density that
we're seeing of the shape
in engine you can see that we can import
the whole coil form as VDB grid
straights into the viewport and this
allows us to do lots of editing inside
of the engine in context so we can
change the color parameters and also how
the lighting is affected
and we can also reduce or increase the
density
and this allows us to create lots of
different effects throughout the whole
game we treating the coil really is as a
character throughout the arc of
squadron' so much like during a Films
production you can you can generally
kind of get a story kind of color arc
from it so many films and you know as
many websites out there that break this
stuff down now you can you can break
down the film's timeline to certain
colors it's done to kind of complement
what's going on in the script the coil
generally kind of will be doing that as
well so obviously it's dynamic during
the course of of the game it can go from
being kind of soft wispy kind of calming
to a cat which generally is a helped
more than hindrance but also don't you
in the ARCA can get aggressive dense
stormy it's going to react dynamically
to the Sun obviously that's the most
powerful light source that we can
possibly have in the system so it needs
to shade well with that but then also
you've got several kind of events that
go on inside the coil a different
location so they could be plasma storms
they could be lightning storms they
could just be you just want to over arch
any kind of rim like certain things
using this technology so on the
forefront of it we can do all that with
our eyes closed with just general
geometry so like the ships and the stage
space stations and all the planets and
stuff the lighting system is very much
kind of catered to that but when you go
from something that is that scale to
something that is absolutely huge there
is a degree of you know new to new
technology that needs to be written for
that there was new kind of gas cloud
light light entities that came in they
in turn have their own kind of noise
functions so we can hint it kind of
flickering kind of like pulsating storms
in the distance this in turn gives us
just a great tool for composition right
so if we want to hint it you know danger
in the distance you don't want to go
there you generally gonna use a light
source for that it was you know another
undertaking and another kind of degree
of understanding on not only the tall
side but also the production cycles when
I started using it I was obviously kind
of so defaulted back into like your old
figures
of light intensities so if you were to
like say a room you gonna have a light
intensity maybe between point five two
five right if you go up to like a Bengal
hangar for example you got some light
intensities running into you know one
hundred hundred and fifty but which is
almost like a football stadium in
intensity when you go into you know
lighting a coil if you wanted to like a
distance thing you're going into you
know 50,000 60,000 70,000 so that sense
of scale and adjusting for that is it is
kind of mind warping when you when
you're doing at points once you've got
that in place then you've got this
beautiful luxury of okay you put a
station next to this kind of cloud you
like that cloud up instead of just
having this bleached sunlight coming
through all the time and just this black
on the other side you can bounce that
light off and then you get nice
three-point lighting on these assets
which is is you know key in in my
opinion of not that's just that black
that you see all the time it's something
we always struggle with is to make
interest in space environments because
when you're in an FPS location and
you're trying to build an environment
around a specific location on a planet
it's quite easy to say let's have a hero
mountain
I'll let's make something quite unique
in this area but when you're in space
okay how can we do that we've got
asteroids we've got you know planets but
how do we feel that void and this was a
big answer to that I think it was a way
that we could bring a cinematic
experience to the campaign and a real
centerpiece for the campaign as well so
you're not just flying around in an
empty void we're always kind of talking
about these these kind of veins running
through the coil and tunnels that will
help with general kind of navigation
throughout the game so if you if you do
fly into a volume that you know that you
can't really see far in front of just
prepare for the unexpected it also gives
us a luxury of you know potentially
Easter eggs here and there and and
whatnot which is kind of nice from a
design point of view but generally it's
it's not advised to go in there is going
to be systems fed into the flight model
that will kind of complement everything
that's going on
this so should you fly into a risky area
there will be a degree of turbulence it
starts to vibrate your cockpit
instrumentation panels will start some
well function generally it will it will
be it will go far much further than just
visuals right so it needs to feel like
you're you're in a place that you're not
supposed to be and that is it that is
being fed into a lot of missions as well
so at times potentially you may need to
be forced out from the cockpit and and
go it alone which is a very kind of
powerful tool to have at your disposal
from from a game scripting point of view
we've taken some good steps towards that
during this demo but obviously there's a
lot more to come so that's going to be
our challenge is making the content look
good but making it flexible enough for
the different departments to do what
they want with both from like an art
direction point of view to say I want it
to look like a certain way and then also
from a design point of view to say I
want it to play a certain way then also
from a VFX point of view because those
guys like Caleb and Oliver have been
really heavily involved in the look and
feel of it as well so they need their
opportunity to go in there and to make
it look the way that they expect it to
look as well and to to kind of come off
our direction and visual direction as
well because it might be a case of okay
this looks great but can we increase the
noise or can we increase the density in
a certain area if we were creating a
planetside location we would expect a
certain amount of flexibility in that
location it might be the flexibility to
say I want to put my pirate base here
and then I want to be able to place
about one in the background and then
maybe sculpt some of the local terrain I
think ideally from an environment point
of view we want the same level of
flexibility with this system as we would
expect with all the game systems now
because we're dealing with volumetrics
it's going to be more difficult and
because we're dealing with new
technology it's gonna be more difficult
but that's what we're going to ask for
ultimately is that flexibility in the
engine because it gives us so much more
power from both not from our department
from an art point of view but from
designers and everyone else who can have
that flexibility in the engine then the
key issue for for us to get on top of
really is the memory stuff which Ben
will probably talk a lot more of which
which will be quite quite an in-depth
talk I imagine the tech at the moment is
it's functional but it uses its very
memory hungry compared to what we would
want to ship I'd say I'd say we probably
want it to run in about 10% of the
memory that it currently casts we want
to absolutely confirm that the things
that were the things that we've achieved
with the current tech is exactly how we
want it to look like completely nailed
down the look of it and then once we've
nailed down the look of it we can go
back and say where are we where are we
wasting memory where are we wasting
performance we need more debug tools in
engine really so we could take a slice
through it for instance and just find
out where is it spending memory and is
it getting any benefit for the memory of
spending there like being able to sort
of work out whether the asset has a
bunch of areas that it's spending memory
that it doesn't need or if it's
something in our compiled process that
it's wasting that memory
it might also involve sort of switching
the formats around and stuff so that it
can it can analyze what the artists have
put in and it'll say for instance
they've put some very crinkly detail in
and some very wispy detail and rather
than just trying to store everything at
really high res so that you can have the
crinkly detail to sort of I don't know
maybe separate separate out the wispy
stuff from the crinkly stuff and store
them into parallel formats or something
like and the other thing actually that
it doesn't do yet is things receiving
shadows from the coil that's that's a
thing where we kind of need to be
absolutely certain of the tech that
we're doing for now because once you
have to cast shadows onto other stuff
you're looking at other systems so yeah
other parts of the engine would then
have to start receiving stuff from the
coil to say yes there's a shadow here so
we don't want to have to update all of
them every time we change the coil that
that is a challenge because it has to
talk to a load of other systems but at
the same time it's it's quite similar to
how we have to do atmospheric scattering
so I'm kind of assuming that we're going
to be able to kind of like thread in to
generalize the path that the and that
the it's very scattering is using
and sort of talk to talk to the system
through the same hole basically by
switching to a hierarchical format it
just means if there's a big empty hole
in the middle of it or there's an area
where it's fairly smooth data then we
just don't have to spend that much
memory on it it also means that so we
kind of rein march through it for each
pixel so anytime you're going past
something that actually knows upfront
that it's low res it doesn't have to do
as many samples as it passes through
that area that's what we've currently
got in terms of runtime performance
we're also looking at doing things like
because it's quite fluffy you possibly
don't need to be running it at like one
ray for every pixel like you could run
you could run it a half or quarter res
and then after you've done it work out
which pixels don't match up with that
very well and like throw throw some
extra rays at the bits that need that
need fixing up afterwards rather than
just sort of brute forcing your way
through the entire thing Oh overall like
if you a lot a lot of space games
generally and you know our game up to
this point really has been you jump from
point A to B so if you wanted to get
from planet to planet B for example
you're just gonna go into orbit and take
a jump that's okay for the most part but
for a story a heavy story driven game
it's extremely boring so the coil gives
us the the facility to almost kind of
like design routes and design pacing in
space so rather than just you know the
quickest point from A to B is a straight
line we may be forcing the player into
these kind of different scenarios which
again it is nice but it's also much like
when you design an FPS map you need to
design the route through the coil as
well so yeah that's that's again
incredibly challenging because you've
got third-party tools that really don't
facilitate that but we've got these
tools in the engine that do facilitate
that it's about marrying those things up
together to make that possible so the
the coil opened up this whole gas cloud
tech and as the coil is like this large
stormy nebula we can actually use the
same tech for other parts of the game so
whenever you want to get enter and ever
late
you can we can use the same volume based
technology to fly through the different
forms and create really interesting
different environments for the player to
explore so cooking is a process in
Houdini for evaluating this large node
graph that you make it's a very
procedural system so in fume effects you
generally simulate so you calculate from
one frame to the next frame what happens
in Houdini you can also do simulations
but you can also procedurally generate
from a source match all the different
stages that you put up on top of it this
allows you to go into one stage and
change it and make a small laceration
there and have it will follow through
one one thing that we concentrated on
during the development of the coil was
not just the volumetric aspect of the
coil isn't as an entity
it was also visual targets for how it
should always should look and fail at
certain points in the coil and we did
this really early on as we were
developing the volumetric attack we also
looked at okay well how does a location
inside the coil look how does it look as
you're approaching the coil you know
what kind of things do we expect to
happen as you fly into the coil so that
could be things like turbulence on the
ship for instance it could be VFX it
could be like localized particles that
start to ramp up as you get close to
this and which is incidentally something
we did do based on kind of based on the
density of the coil you get localized
particles driven and by Game Code so
there was a lot of work that went into
these visual targets and that was
separating scenes out and then saying
okay well for instance the Star Ferry
wreck which is something we saw in the
live stream we took that as a location
and said we we know how the like Nathan
Daisley went and he even already made
that video and he'd kind of defined the
look and feel of that area or ID so we
took that I said okay we were taking
this as a direction of how it should
feel and look inside the coil and let's
try and expand out of that as well so we
built tunnel routes down to where you
know we tried to fit like how does it
feel when you traverse it inside this
thing there was a lot of development
that went into that you know some of it
you see in the final version and the
lives
again some of it was was kind of
throwaway we didn't use it in the end
but it really defined what we wanted for
this stuff it's important not only to
define the form and the volume of what
the coil is but how does it feel how
does it how does it look at any point
not just specific locations in the live
stream but also locations for the rest
of the game as well well this is going
to be a huge huge part of the game so
and we've got a lot of content inside
the coil so defining how that looks and
feels is important to us really late on
in development and we're talking maybe a
week or two before we went live we had
we had a direction change on it we what
we had made was looking pretty cool but
it didn't feel menacing enough it didn't
feel it felt it felt too enjoyable for a
player to be in that environment whereas
everything like I was describing before
this is supposed to be a hostile
environment it's supposed to be
somewhere that you shouldn't really go
to as a player it wouldn't be where
you'd choose to build your station for
instance so we we had to change it and
we had to make it look more in line with
the lore of it and that that was a color
change yes we went from the kind of the
kind of the etheral blues to this kind
of more menacing red kind of vibe to it
which I think just changed the mood and
the feel of the entire if the entire
chapter or mission that takes place
there and that's why I like a week or
two before I think actually I think it
was the Sunday before we would used to
go live I think on the Thursday that's
when we made the change and it was a
case of kind of me and Caleb sitting on
it on Sunday and kind of trying to come
up with something Monday morning we had
a review with the directors web CR
luckily they liked it so we were already
starting to you know discover new uses
for this technology for example like in
trios seen in the demo you you in this
kind of debris field that's the sort of
you know rotating around that around
that planet genuinely it looked quite
flat without any volumetric shading in
it
fog obviously everyone knows I'm a big
fan of the fog so we
already started using you know can we
use this technology is compliment for
example asteroid fields or you know
rings around a planet we do have a type
of shader that will do that but it's
very kind of cheap and suffers with kind
of breaking it certain angles you'll
notice it in the game if you catch it at
the wrong angle it'll kind of look a
little bit strange for a split second
and then snap back but with this because
it's fully volumetric and fully kind of
you know is shading correctly to the Sun
model that's there it just looks ten
times better
and you can fly into it so you get a
sense of full volumetric shading and
which is which is really nice you get
that sense of depth basically that this
the other technique won't give you
almost like location scouting we call it
and similar to how development happens
on a planet actually is that once you've
once you've built this location you know
you've you've you've built mountains
you've built rivers you build the sea
you know where all your kind of key
locations are and then you can go into
that environment and say okay I want I
want location a to be here on this
mountain the one location B to be done
by the sea or something like that and
then you can work out paths between it
it's a similar kind of process here
where we we kind of build a section of
the coil that just works and looks cool
and visually is what our direction
expects it to be and this is where I go
back to that flexibility as well because
having that flexibility means that would
have a little bit more control than that
in the engine rather than just saying it
would look cool from this location oh
but the pathway out of here doesn't
really work well we would then be able
to create a pathway out there that
worked well for us in terms of
connecting these pockets together that's
going to be slightly different and
that's a challenge that's going to come
up in the next few months we're going to
have different locations in squadron'
different really cool locations and
they're going to be different pockets
and we're going to have traversal routes
between those locations as well and for
me the traversal routes are going to be
something that I'm hoping we can really
play with you know how do those
traversal routes work are they going to
be really closed in environments like
tunnels we did do some you may hear from
some of the engineering guys like when
we started really early on in
development we did a lot of rather than
big open spaces with this volumetric
technology
we did more confined closed spaces so
tunnel systems that connect together no
as a player navigating these tunnels it
feels cool
so maybe we can look to bring some of
that back in as well and we've got
different mission specific locations in
squadron connecting them with cool
tunnels design but love that as well
because it gives them an opportunity to
get some flight of gameplay in there
like the stuff that we made for the
livestream when you come out from Shubin
to the the outside of the coil yeah it
felt cool but you didn't really not
recognize it as being a volumetric
entity until your constant travelled
away from it now if we did travel into
cons base or any of a specific mission
location
let's close those tunnels down and see
how that feels because I could be a
really cool traversal we're being really
industry-leading here like when you
build a lot of conventional environments
there's a lot you can look back on
there's a lot of influence you can look
back on there's a lot of other games of
tents we've done the same things you
know if we were looking at an FPS
environment around I go back to this
pyro base on the planet but you know if
we had a jungle around that base then we
might go back and look at some of the
earlier Crysis stuff or we might look at
some of the more recent environments
that are coming online to try and kind
of drive the workflow and practices that
we have but when it comes to build in
with this technology because there's not
really a great deal out there it we're
defining that workflow we're defining
those practices so there is a bit of
trial and error in there and that's the
difference you know if I was going to
make texture for a rock I'd know exactly
what software to use if I'm going to
make a box or for a volumetric system
well there's there's a few options in
there some of them better than others
and that's what we've got a workout
really pretty interesting with all the
stuff that we're doing and thinking
about and working on in the future and
as you can see the coil is an integral
component to squadron not just as an
environment but also as a character in
its own right if you want to stand the
front lines of squadron 42 s development
head to the games web page where you can
enlist to receive monthly updates and
never miss one of our around the verse
squadron specials yes and don't forget
to check out the RSI on star citizen
sections of the website as well the
entire site has been redesigned and went
live earlier today and we can't wait to
see what you guys think
of the overhaul we're pretty proud of it
we think it's pretty slick yes it is and
to celebrate the new look and feel of
the site we have some new merchandise
and packages available including a slick
mouse pad from Whitley's guide a new
star citizen t-shirt and the loot and
scoot ship pack from Drake for all you
aspiring pirates out there there's a few
of those yes there are also remember you
can still pick up squadron 42 for just
$15 until the end of the month with
these super-sized meat promotion yeah
that's a pretty good deal for everything
squadron 42 for even more than squadron
42 tune in tomorrow at noon PST for a
new episode of reverse vers live where i
chris roberts sit down with community
content manager jared huckaby
to discuss the game further and if you
haven't seen it check out last week's
reverse the verse where guest jeff
Zanelli answers questions from backers
about pending squadron 42 s music yeah
jeff has caught a ton of films and
television shows like HBO's and Pacific
and the latest Pirates of the Caribbean
film and it's a great interview for
anyone interested in the cinematic
