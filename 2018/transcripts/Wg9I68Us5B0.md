hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Sandy Gardner and
I'm Eric Kiren Davis this week we'll
dive into to flight AI audio design and
get a lot of this asteroid
mining but first let's see what players
have been up to in the verse recently a
strange monolithic Effigy appeared in
the unforgiving dear
desert dubbed the dear Rocket Man this
emergent art project was the culmination
of 10 players working to position a
bunch of ships including 40 gray cat
buggies into the shape of a huge and
seemingly happy
human Sandy can you name all the ships
used to construct said Rocket Man yes I
can constellations caterpillars there's
a couple star yeah there you go at any
rate impressive work there now let's
march on to development updates we've
been following the development of
asteroid mining for a while now and the
mechanic is now feature complete yay
with the gameplay team making final
tweaks to space friction here's Dan
truffin to take us through a full
gameplay Loop hey I'm Dan truffin I'm
the lead system designer uh in the
Frankfurt office and uh I'm going to
show you some of our work on the on the
asterid mining basically it's an
evolution of our planetary Mining and
the next logical place to take it would
been space so here it
is we are here in the asteroid belt
around yella we're going to find a rock
and try to extract various important
minerals from it uh generally rocks are
going to be a bit harder to find in
space at least usable rocks they're
going to be a lot further apart
generally we use new assets for this but
we also manage to reuse some of the
existing rocks with just with a nice
texture they went again through our
minable Rock pipeline they have a
different texture and on the inside of
them uh they also when they break they
they look different from the rocks on
the planet the mining process basically
works very similar to how you guys are
used to you just aim the mining laser
and try to keep the rock energy level
where it needs to be in the optimum Zone
you try to keep it in the green zone and
not go in the red zone as I am right
now going in the red zone is a lot more
detrimental in space because once the
rock explodes the pieces will end up
going in every
direction since this is space they take
a while to stop there's no ground to
stop them as you see they'll be flying
and flying and flying so if you do a bad
job you really will have to run after
every piece of Rock
provided you guys don't mess it up and
do what I did you should be able to
extract valuable resources if you manage
to keep your extractor beam in the same
position you'll extract faster if you
move it around on the Rock they'll
extract slower so obviously a rock that
is hurtling through space is going to be
slower to
extract that's about it I'm really not
going to spend time searching all of
these rocks they might take a while to
get all of them but uh hope you guys
enjoy this
that's not all from the exciting world
of mineral extraction new Surface side
rocks are being introduced as well the
environment team has been working on
minable formations for the acidic biomes
will see on Hurston and its Moon Arial
they've been improving the existing Rock
generator pipeline to create a variety
of different shapes faster not only does
this help when creating new types of
minerals it also helps improve the look
of existing minable rocks and adds clear
visual differentiation
between their exterior and interior
textures the audio team has been working
on a feature that lets the player Focus
their listening this will allow you to
listen to specific cues or conversations
even if you're in a crowded room or
noisy area let's go to Bob Rolo and
Simon price for more on this feature so
listener focus is a new feature we're
working on to mimic the phenomenon that
happens when you focus intently on
something you get this sense of tunnel
vision you kind of focus on what's in
front of you and everything behind you
starts to blur out well we want to do
this with audio the thing that you're
looking at intently comes sharply into
focus in the mix and then everything
else drops back into the background and
it allows for better immersion it really
kind of has that realistic feel to it
cuz it's a natural phenomenon The
Listener Focus effect is sometimes
called the cocktail party effect so I
thought I'd load into Cafe Misan to
demonstrate it to today so here we are
in game I'll enable some debug commands
so we can visualize what the audio
engine's doing the gray balls represent
a neutral Focus because we're not paying
attention to any person in the bar right
now I'll play a little dialogue so you
can hear the reference levels what do
you want whiskey beer or whiskey can
hear the bartender struggling over the
music and art over the other side is
barely
audible now imagine we're really thirsty
I set the focus to be on the bartender
the music dies
down and there are red bulls represent
negative Focus what do you want whiskey
beer or whiskey we can hear the
bartender clearly now if we Zoom back
out we can hardly hear art at
all imagine we're not thirsty we're
looking for a mission we're here to meet
someone I set the focus on to
eart the green green balls represent a
positive Focus so here I'm using the
effect additively I'm not only bringing
down sounds that we're not interested in
but we're raising eart so that we can
hear him from all the way across the bar
look at and that's how the listener
Focus effect works we've previously
taken looks at some of the background
effects and details the various teams
have been developing to make lorville
feel like a bustling kinetic location
one such detail that is being worked on
currently is the presence of AI Control
old non-combat ships taking off and
landing at the city's Interstellar
Transit hubs here is Andre beu to walk
us through the process of getting these
ships into and out of
[Music]
lorville hello my name is Andreu I'm a
senior system designer on Star Citizen
at the moment for 33 I am working on
enabling civilian AI ships to appear
over lville then make their way down to
the city touch down stick around for a
bit take off again make their way back
to orbit and then Quantum travel
somewhere else what I can show you here
is in a test environment what this looks
like so this is a star farer coming down
from orbit via a spline which is
basically a pre-placed path once the
star farer has reached this placeholder
landing pad it will switch over to the
takeoff and Landing system which is
powered by uh the ifcs it will then
touch down stick around for a few
seconds
though this is still placeholder in the
final version they will stick around for
longer the ifcs lets it take off again
and then it switches back to the
pre-placed spline the path which will
take it back to orbit launch sequence
complete this is the environment where
the city will be but with everything
else but the splines made invisible the
spines are those blue paths they are
coming down from the
orbit to the surf surface of the
planet where the landing zones are which
are those lzs here and then there are
more splines going back into orbit what
I'm doing right now is I'm trying to
give the ship a more cinematic feel by
adding something that looks like the air
bre that ships usually do in other
cinematic products so in this case for
example this is the orientation of the
ship which I can adjust on the spine so
I will pull up its nose a bit and on the
next point maybe a bit
more and then on the final one it goes
down a bit again and this is when ifcs
takes over
and on the next
spine everything is already taken care
of by the automated system but if for
example I wanted it to fly a bit more
straightfor a bit I could do
this or to bank around
so this is what we're working on for 33
we hope you like it and see you in the
verse here we see more of the props in
this case cable sets being polished and
implemented into utilitarian hangers and
other locations around
lville designers continue working on
combat AI for FPS situations with
attention being given to Sharp
turns Guard and Patrol behaviors using
new idle animations hit reactions both
in and out of
cover and search path
logic anyone joining us on October 10th
in Austin Texas for citizen con 2948
should take advantage of a fun contest
we have going right now yeah you can
enter your best ideas for new emotes on
Spectrum the winner will get to direct
professional map actors live at citizen
con where their winning emote will begin
its Journey towards in-game
implementation just imagine every Star
Citizen we'll be thinking of you
whenever it is you're doing the Hoke
Pokey or really other dance types yeah
okay and with that we say goodbye for
this week don't miss reverse the verse
back in the USA and streaming live on
Twitch tomorrow big thanks to our
subscribers who sponsor the shows and of
course thank you to our backers yes
