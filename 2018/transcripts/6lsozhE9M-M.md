hello and welcome to another episode of
around the verse I'm Sandy Gardner and
I'm Josh Herman this week we'll check
back in on player hat get a first look
at new moons as well as updates on props
and ships but not before checking in
with the Star Citizen Community on
September 22nd there's a
community-driven gathering in mulheim
Germany called con 42 if you're in the
area you'll definitely want to check it
out yes you will it's always great to
see fans put on their own Gatherings
from impromptu bar citizens to larger
conventions like con 42 meanwhile the
dayar rally folks are back at it
again the filthiest racers in the verse
put together a great C social event over
the weekend players were transported to
an undisclosed location on the moon
where they were engaged in a multi-lap
time trial all in graycat
buggies very cool and they got some
really impressive shots there now let's
March into the development updates
beginning with the modular and lighting
teams who are currently working together
on player
Habs we've already seen the design
progression of player Habs and these
earliest forms of in-game housing
continue to be built out and improved
approved the developers are currently
taking a lighting pass so here's the
lead lighting artist Chris Campbell to
walk us through that
process so the last couple of weeks I've
been working on the lville Habs units
the lobby and the the Habs themselves
where the player has their personal
items and a bed to sleep in and so the
first step uh in the lobby is we usually
get a a piece of concept art from the
art director or the concept artist which
show kind of the the basic mood of the
environment and some color tones and
stuff like that so the first thing I do
is I block in the main kind of key
lights uh so we know immediately that
the player can go up these stairs uh and
then once we have that then we have um
the Habs units themselves need to be the
kind of primary focus uh and then
everything else is kind of detail
lighting to support that so we have like
these Al Cove uh off to the side areas
which don't serve any any gameplay
purpose but you know it adds a bit of
flavor and a bit of contrasting colors
so it's not just the same shades of of
yellow and orange throughout the entire
environment so once we have that blocked
in the next steps uh that I have is to
apart from lighting the Interiors of the
Habs themselves is I'm also uh adding
kind of lighting variations within each
layout so you know players might have a
choice of what kind of style of lighting
they want in their
Habs that looks very cool Chris as a
character designer Josh what is your
relationship to
Lighting in characters lighting is a
little bit more it's a little different
characters are going to Traverse through
different types of environments an
environment like a Hab you're able to
set like a specific mood or tone so each
player can have their own different
style right but for characters it's a
bit more unique because they're going to
walk through each one of those
environments so it's more about
describing the form of the character
than it is creating the
mood all right here we see conceptual
renderings of lria and Walla two of art
corpse moons it's interesting to see the
earliest stages of visual development as
the artists and devs dig into content
that will come online further down the
road the artists have to think about all
the visual subtleties that give each
Moon A distinct look and feel wallet is
a simple Barren moon with outcrops of
geod likee minerals liia surface
consists of dirty ice scarred by Deep
crevices and dotted with cryo volcanoes
that create a constant cold but humid
atmosphere on the moon while we're on
the topic of concept art a few weeks ago
we showed you early renderings of the
new lockers they'll be used in missions
both new and existing as an alternate
means for players to pick up and drop
off items let's let props artists Phelps
and Mission designer Daniel Reynolds
shed some light on the design process
and their in-game
functionality recently I've been working
on the drop off lockers these are for
collecting and delivering Cargo in the
game uh early on we were working on the
dimensions of the whole prop and we
found that the size of the screen next
to the cargo hatch made it a really wide
prop and this didn't really work with
the original concept so we sort of
re-evaluated we decided that the the
screen didn't need to be this big so we
scaled it down and and ended up with
something that suit the concept A lot
better yeah so one of the things I did
was designed the door we decided to go
for a shutter door rather than a swing
open hatch that you can see here and
this is so that when the play is
interacting with the prop the door
doesn't swing open and collide with them
it's all self-contained this way so
we're pretty much finished with this now
it's just up to the missions team to
take it on and implement it into the
game so with the addition of the
delivery lockers it's added an extra
element to the delivery missions
alongside the admin desks and The
Outpost shelves the player may now get
asked to pick up or drop off a mission
item at one of these delivery lockers
when the player goes to interact with
these lockers it'll first check to see
if you have a delivery record if the
player doesn't have a delivery Mission
or they go to the wrong Locker it will
deny them access to the locker and
return back to the start screen if they
do have a a mission and they are at the
right Locker it will check and then
succeed which point it'll open the
shutter up and either display the item
to pick up or ask the player to drop the
item off at the Shelf we use subsumption
to create the mission module which
controls which locker gets selected and
also controls the mission broker record
to detect when an item's been attached
or detached from these lockers so
they're currently for 3.3 uh there's
still some work to be done for the UI
and it's currently going through testing
at the
moment sticking with props the team is
finishing the final hanger assets which
are being placed in the environments by
the design
19 they've also made progress on their
major location signage for lville which
will add movement and context to the
city's Transit
areas a few weeks ago we saw the motion
warping Tech being developed and refined
for both Squadron 42 and the Pu that's
the system that adapts character
animations to allow for realistic
traversal of obstacles let's go to Mike
Meen for a look at what the new tool set
has to offer and how it will factor into
the design of both games recently uh the
ACT be team's working on motion warping
um we've been working on this for a
little while but now we're actually
working on the workflow and the tools
that we use to implement this in games
what you're going to see here is an
asset that we've put together for vating
without any motion W points so this is
this is how it looks kind of as just one
asset without anything put on it what we
need to do is actually put um these War
points onto the animation to tell the
game where to transform this asset so
you'll see here M um the gameplay coder
who's actually creating the the system
and these tools for us and you can see
here is's about to demonstrate how you
add those W points directly within mea
these are plugins and things that he's
actually built for us so you can see him
adding each of these points what these
do is tell us specifically at what point
you warp and and it also gives us that
data to read once we go in game you you
do this the once in in in Maya in the
animation and then once you have all
those points set up we can actually
export that asset out and it will keep
those points once we have those War
points we can actually export the
animation into the game
as soon as we're in game you'll see that
that now the the engine will actually
read those War points and translate that
onto the animation so it can adapting to
various situations once we're there we
can actually um continue to visualize
scenarios that maybe we haven't
encountered in the levels we can use the
tools that we have at our disposal to
just you know drag those same points
that we created in Maya around you know
just kind of the limitations of those
assets the benefit of doing this is that
um it allows our developers to iterate
much quicker and easier it's definitely
a massive quality of life Improvement
especially when it's using Technologies
like motion whopping um which aren't
always the best you know the easiest
thing to visualize um how it's going to
work especi this the kind of Technology
the idea is that it's adaptable to a
large you know variety of situations
this way we can do it really quickly fun
who doesn't like quality of life
improvements finally let's take a look
at some recent work from the ship
teams the Hammerhead is nearing the end
of its final art phase with lighting
States recently completed for all areas
of the ship the Banu Defender has been
completely blocked out in y box and the
interior has entered the graybox phase
with designers working to establish the
Ban's distinct architectural and design
