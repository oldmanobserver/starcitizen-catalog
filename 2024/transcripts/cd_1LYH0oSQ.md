## Transcript

oh that's the wrong camera there we
are hi now just Gabe start the show
hello welcome to Star Citizen
live who are
you I'm Gabriel Hector and what do you
do I'm a systems designer at the
Manchester office for cig and you're
going to host this week's show yeah
that's the plan so Jared who are you and
what do you do at Cloud Imperium games W
thanks Gabe uh I'm Jared I'm I don't
know what I'm in charge of uh hi
everybody Welcome to Star Sisson live uh
we're by ourselves today um uh David who
you sometimes hear me shout out to uh uh
is feeling under the weather today so
we've we've set up uh we literally moved
the control stuff over here so I have to
do everything for the show so we'll see
how it goes the last time I did it last
did it like this was the um the big and
victus all vehicles Round Table last
year and I managed to pull that off
there was more people so it should be
fine uh hi welcome to Star live I'm
Jared this is the show at the end of the
week where we grab a bunch of our
developers and we take your questions we
put them to them and they answer their
question your questions and we learn all
about this wonderful project we're
working on Star Citizen joining us on
the show this week are esteem members of
the UI feature team we've got Gabe we've
got bone we've got got Zane and we've
got Emily hi everybody hello hi so Gabe
you've already done your intro yeah
you're not technically on
the UI team but you you know you're a
designer system designer on the on the
on the Pu and Squadron teams you know
you help yeah and I have a lot of focus
on UI features all all over the place I
I've got my finger and everything and
I'm
annoying these guys a
lot so uh bone we'll start with you uh
tell everybody who are and what you do
for Star Citizen hello uh I'm David
bongill uh everyone calls me bone as I
may have mentioned before uh I'm a
technical director for the UI on Star
Citizen and squading 42 okay uh zann
tell everybody who you are and what you
do hi I'm zann um I I'm a UI developer
programmer designer and I guess I don't
really know really what my title is at
any given time I'm supposed to be on
core Tech but I not really haven't
touched that in a while so I just do
everything and I've been lately working
working on the map system yeah I'm
pretty sure you and I are in the running
for the most number of titles that we've
had in in the time here that is
constantly trying to figure out exactly
where we fit in it's just it's just our
ambition to want to do everything so
bone tell us who Emily is oh blind
me no Emily who are you and what are you
yeah uh I'm Emily I'm a UI programmer um
predominantly at the moment working on
the star so yeah that's pretty much me
yeah we are we are out of cameras we
need more cameras to for for more people
we're going we're going we're going to
try to upgrade the show here in a little
bit um all right so we took questions
from the community we put them on or we
put a thread up on Spectrum we gathered
questions we let you guys go through and
pull the questions we're just going to
jump right into it uh because it's
really hard for me to do all the
multitasking stuff all right so right
off the that first
question uh yeah this one yeah will we
be able to select start Zoom we will be
able to select start Zoom of map okay if
I'm a p if I'm in the pilot seat I would
like it to start zoomed out in the in
the system map but if I'm standing in my
ship I would like it zoomed in on the
world map so basically can they set
different Zoom levels as default based
on what situation they're in I think we
agreed so much with this yeah yeah yeah
I've actually been working on this this
week um yeah so now you will be able to
uh sit in the ship and you're open the
star map and it will open to the star
map and if you are anywhere else it will
open to the interior map if you have an
interior map um we've also um started
the star M out further now so when it
will like Zoom back out so you get like
a view of the sort of system that you're
in a little bit more rather than being
like face up with a planet texture um
another thing I've added is a keybind so
that if you're in the star map you can
just press that and go straight into the
interior map we don't have the other way
yet but we have that way um so yeah so
it's hopefully going to work a lot more
smoothly now and you can be in the
context you actually want to be
in that sounds very cool um I think I
think before we jump in here there's
going to be a lot of conversation about
you know iterative development there's
this assumption that when a thing comes
out it's everything all at once and
anybody who's been paying attention to
the development of Star Citizen over the
years knows that that's not how how it
works this is the next group of things
the group of features next functionality
we can do and then it will continue to
evolve and iterate on subsequent patches
so we'll hear some variation of that
answer quite a bit uh tonight uh
question two do you plan to add filters
on the interior maps and star Maps so we
can easily find specific
POI so yeah this is obviously something
that we do want uh so it's it's in the
designs it's in the in the documents uh
but it it's not maybe the top priority
right now uh we we need to get this
stuff just working as good as possible
and then then we'll just have to
prioritize after that um obviously not
an extensive list but uh what kind of
filters off the top of your head were we
thinking about so it's essentially what
you see as the amenities so for anyone
who's been playing the PTU uh you've
seen that now that when you use the star
map you can click a location and then
you get a list of amenities there so you
can see oh I can buy ships here so
essentially we would reverse that and
you could say I want to buy a ship where
can I do that rather than having to go
through every single place and then see
oh I can buy a ship there so it's it's
going to make it way nicer uh but yeah I
mean the other thing for like the
interior Maps like
it's pretty much just showing like like
uh like room labels and stuff but uh
like in the future we're going to have a
lot more uh amenities that are pointed
out on it like icons depicting uh like
here's where you buy weapons here's
where you you know retrieve your ship or
whatever it is that's going to be useful
then you know we'll have filters based
on those categories um but that's that's
in the future we need to uh do some um
more kind of back end work for that yeah
I imagine you know many of these
features that are coming in 323 were
first developed for squadron and then
are being brought over to to to the Pu
and there's the Pu requires a lot of
additional functionality that perhaps
Squadron you know you know doesn't you
know squadron's you know this big
sprawling single player game but it is a
single player game in a massively
multiplayer persistent Universe with
multiple star systems and stuff there
are far more consideration that that
need to be taken so so yeah this first
version will go in it'll have a lot of
limited functionality and then it will
continue to evolve yeah yeah so there's
a lot of stuff that we've added on as
part of this process of Bring It
bringing it over from Squadron where it
was this thing that was suited for
squadron specifically and then it goes
into Star Citizen and it immediately
needs so much more so what started out
as just move it into Star Citizen has
become quite
task but I think I guess in that respect
it's also accelerated uh the um like the
robustness like for the maps for example
it's it's uh the fact that we need to
get pu and and and working all all
properly with all all the different
systems is it's also going to go back
into Squadron as well it's not just
Squadron going into pu it's also very uh
like all the stuff that we've done is
very general and so it'll also benefit
Squadron as well it's good that's not a
that's not a point we often oh
look wow David why don't we use this
sorry just disc I just discovered a toy
usually it's David of this thing um no
you make a good point uh uh the work on
these features you know like I said all
the work for squadron serves the Pu but
like it had did before and like it will
continue to do this work will still
funnel back up the stream back into
Squadron and stuff so so B discover
technology says I I discovered fun thing
look at this look at
this hey there's nothing wrong with
being easily amused those people are
generally happier than most others um
okay we've got uh several questions
about pins one of the more exciting
aspects uh that we revealed is that you
can finally you know set pin pin
pinpoints markers on the verse um first
question is will our map pinpoint
markers uh that we drop be persistent if
we log out and log back in the next day
that's definitely the plan yeah but
there's a lot of backend work that we
need to look into and especially with
server meshing coming in so a thing that
happened for the 323 work that we've
been doing is that we started talking
about okay we want to get these pins in
as part of the star map now and you
should be able to place them and share
them with people and all of that jazz
but then we looked into it and well it
was quite hard to do and we're getting
server maching so everything's going to
change and it just wouldn't work with
yeah with the future the technical
challenge is immense it it like the pin
itself like drawing a pin on the map
fine yeah uh persist in it and on in
this sort of super complicated uh
structure that we have um is tricky
tricky to say the least that's not to
say we won't work on it just oh no we're
working on it yes it's just uh
uh it's not that
straightforward
no okay sorry um will we be able to
share the locations that we save from
the star map with other players yeah for
sure that that's part of the vision
again um so you should be able to share
the so we can see in 323 you can place
the markers in on the area map and in
the future you should be able to place
them on the star map and those should be
the same kind of thing you have a list
of all your markers that you placed and
you should be able to share them with
your party and so on uh but it will as I
just said we will need to look into the
tech of it and see how that actually
works
out um and then last of the oh that's
bone see playing with the
toys uh will we be able to set pins in
space I think that's kind of answered
now but yes so star map area map Place
depends wherever you oh like like in
like an arbitary bit of space yeah yeah
and yeah
hopefully it doesn't break gameplay if
we allow players to just actually
Quantum travel there that's something
we'll also have to look into but that
that would be kind of neat place a
marker Builder spring a trap
meet
up all right
um okay I'm going to play a little bit
sorry listen to the words the words what
matter uh what progress has been made on
UI elements to assist with Landing ships
from the firsters uh pilot seat view for
example have we considered holographic
extensions of landing pad or hanger door
boundaries ATC flight tunnels Landing
cameras directional proximity sensors
alerts radar Light Art scan mfds Pilots
visors like we've had a couple different
things over the course of our
development where are we going
yes look right into the camera and say
yes
yes do you want to elaborate oh no I
think Emily might have some
answers I was just stealing her Thunder
a little bit Yeah so um there are a lot
of like plans and a lot of uh thoughts
that we have we obviously want to have
like uh use the AR space for markers um
have like if you're going into a hanger
have like a gate bracket so that you
sort of know the bounds of where you're
trying to go um a like ladder sort of
system so you have like a guide to where
you're trying to go uh and then also we
want to make use of the um the radar
display that you have as well to um
actually utilize the area maptac again
to display your ship and like the ground
underneath you and then obviously if you
have a land landing pad it will show you
your landing pad and if you don't have a
landing pad and you're just trying to
land anywhere it'll have like a line
with a shadow kind of thing and it will
sort of guide you to whether you can
land there you know whether it's flat
enough that kind of thing um so these
are the sorts of things that we're
thinking about doing that and and
that'll tie into um how we want to show
terrain and things like that on in our
map system because that's you know I I
want that to be a thing are there any
are there any uh challenges with that
presented by
um by the server meshing and everything
obviously most times your Landing stuff
will just be there where you're at but
is there any you like how far out can
you go is there other concerns that you
know you won't be able to read Parts in
another Shard
whatever no you don't want to you want
to like no they're like okay that's the
thing we always find out in the last
moment well I mean I mean like the the
geometry for planets and stuff is is
streamable but um yeah when you start
talking about being able to see other
players other locations and stuff and
whether they're exactly on your server
and all this kind of stuff that that's
the stuff that gets complicated but the
actually the interesting to thing to
mention is uh when we do account for
like in our map system when we do
account
for uh things not always being streamed
in and you know maybe the space for on
the other side of the city isn't
streamed in so you can't like really see
it or what not and if when we make that
work across the board regardless of
streaming the map should work regardless
of whether things are being are streamed
in or not it should be totally
independent of the entities that are
existing it opens this up to like look
at maps of far away places anywhere that
we've cataloged them so if you're on
another planet you can see you know you
might be able to see the map of what
you've explored and not even be there
okay cool so that's a that's an
interesting like byproduct of that but
uh that it opens up but you
know two benefits in uh in one so sorry
Chad has noticed yes I'm I'm playing let
me have this I don't usually have the
control um all right so we had six
questions important questions but you
know relatively soft balls if you will
the big question here that I think most
people have wanted to know
um I'm going to suod it what's up with
the UI being so
holographic it can become unreadable at
times what's up with that what's going
on more who wants more more more
holographics just put it all on there
make it make it worse I hope everyone
saw the saw the my phone 900 years in
the future future meme that was a good
one it's it's it was very holographic
yes uh
so I I think we have a line to tread
yeah so we want it to look cool right
but we want to be able to use it at the
same time um so there's a balance to be
had like we we're not going to release
something that looks like a vanilla web
page you know that's just black on white
black text on white background for all
the UI for sure see the there's the
extreme where you've got all this
chromatic aberration and Bloom and
uh fog and effects and stuff going on um
and it's not particularly readable and
it's difficult on the eye so we got to
find a balance where um it looks cool
and it's diagetic and it's in the world
and it looks futuristic But ultimately
very usable like you got to be able to
use it and it's not got to um not got to
be bad on you eyes no and I think with
the mob glass in particular because I
think that was maybe the the worst
offender in this case it's it's supposed
to be this holographic thing so it got a
bit over the top and uh we got we got
over excited yeah yeah exactly it can
look even cooler um but uh no we're we
very much appreciate the feedback and I
think everyone's very happy with the
result that we've got now and it's yeah
coming out really well but we're still
dialing that in so yeah yeah for sure to
get the get the tone right it'll be
continuous process and and there's also
some graphical fixes that we've fixed
recently as well like I think uh on some
of the low reses run the texture stuff
it's uh uh there's actually some color
correction uh weirdness going on that
the the graphics seem fixed so that's
probably going to uh increase uh a
little bit like the the brightness of
some of the elements cuz the now the
colors are consistent between low res
full res uh render to texture and
there's also some sorting issues that we
need to uh work out into the system uh
with regards to 3D planes and and 3D
objects there's sorting issues that so
you know we've sort of fixed but uh in
it there's a proper solution we're going
to do Post 323 looking at so it sounds
like some of it is technical some of it
is bugs things not working the way that
they're intended yes and then some of it
is style some of it is is is pushing to
to find this happy meeting yeah finding
a balance of like good good good art but
good usability because if if there's a
uh uh a 3D plane in the world that's
behind another like the thing that's
trying to render a drop shadow over or
whatever it's it's the thing that's over
it and when it's sorted incorrectly is
you're going to null out any of the the
benefits of the the the backdrop or the
the drop shadow or whatever we put in so
and some of the uh some of the diet tic
uis in the are in the world so they
receive the same world post-process
effects so like chromatic operation and
the bloom and all these kind of things
so it's it's trying to combat them
sometimes to make make things perfectly
readable but um they they because we're
doing a diagetic game because these
things in the world you can't can't just
sort of say hey don't apply these
effects because it would look really
really strange it would look really out
of place and like a game rather than um
like a game is in like just putting
stuff on over the top of the screen
after you've rendered the game World
we're we're not really after that kind
of look it's meant to look like it's
part of the scene so these you know uh
kiosks or even the mob glass are part of
the part of the game
world what I'm looking at the chat here
why your folks are talking I want I want
to stay on this topic for a little bit
longer
um some of the folks in chat and not
just chat today but you know I've I've
seen YouTube comments and Spectrum
comments stuff
um the the the common suggestion is why
don't you just start with readability
and then add style later you know and
dial up well it's this this idea of of
start with a base and then build on top
of it instead of the sculptor approach
which start with all this and then start
peeling back um there are there are
benefits to both ways why do we do it
the way we do it I think we do start
with readability but it's internally
right that's not what the players get to
see first because we make our wireframe
designs and we make it like okay this is
what this mobile ass app is doing and
this is how we want to interact with it
and that's all fine uh so let's move on
to the art pass and then it's more where
where can we get the coolness factor
into this and
I think it's good that we're not like
ashamed of that and also that we can
dial it back when when we've done
something wrong when we've gone
overboard but I think we we do have a
strong like visual identity with with
all of these different sci-fi Styles and
different brand Styles and so on uh and
yeah we are doing a good job of really
pushing for that for keeping that
consistent and making it feel like a
coherent world world where all of these
things exist and yeah sometimes it makes
for a lesser user experience than that
that's obviously not great and we want
to improve that and that's why we're
super happy to get this feedback from
players but we never want to end up in a
place where we just remove all the
different styles and everything and just
go okay here's the most legible font in
the world let's just put that right
there in the in in the best size in the
best place like yeah we we it's always a
a balance and I think a lot of times it
it it actually can start out like very
uh having like a high level of contrast
we've done a visual like an initial
visual polish pass on it and then we'll
get very focused on actually doing all
the functionality and you know like the
hollow volume changes to a window and
and then you know we're doing all all
all the uh functionality based on that
and we just haven't had a visual polish
pass until you know the end because
we're focused on sort of the back end
the code and the functionality like all
the really base foundational stuff and
then and then you know pretty much just
near the end we're we're starting to
finally do much more of the visual
polish pass again so there's this thing
that
happens um I don't think I'm telling any
sto I don't think I'm I'm going to I'm
going to say something I don't think
it's going to be any surprise to to
folks who have who followed the project
for the decade and so um we work to the
last minute and then beyond and that
that's kind of in the RSI cig DNA at
that point you know there are lots of
projects where you work on a thing and
then you you you stop and you kind of go
gold and then it just kind of sits there
for a while you there bug fixes and
stuff marketing gets to come in and do
this stuff we we put these things out
you you know uh while they're still
being worked on that's what iati is
that's what PTU is what players are
playing right now even the live Alpha is
still Alpha it's still an unfinished uh
a product and I think a lot of times
just because I've seen the reaction
sometimes it's it's a lot of times this
thing goes out and it's
like couldn't we have just another week
or two to to dial that in before it goes
out and stuff
um does
that does that drive you crazy does that
is that just part of of of who we are
and and Stu like this we're going off
the reservation here a little bit but
but talk to me about this this is a very
real phenomenon it affects everything um
talk to me about how you deal with this
no it's it's for me it's I guess it's
really it's quite exhilarating in a way
but I always wish there's just one more
week just let me play around a little
bit more with the materials let me uh
Let Me Maybe put some animation like
animation in make it a look more
polished uh or you know more more
feedback like like right now I'm I I I
need to put in the uh the routing
feedback so when you press R right now
it silently fails and you're like why
isn't it doing anything uh or um so if
you have that then it's like that's just
a little bit like a small bit that makes
it feel a bit more polished yeah it's
and then when you fix that there's
another thing you think exactly be cool
if we put this in issue right it never
ends there's another thing you can
always keep improving and and that's
just the process of design right so if
we kept adding this one more week all
the time we would just be nothing would
ever release driven insane and nothing
would ever release
so change
who's battery oh my batter's out
oh hold on everybody I see the thing so
they hear me through somebody else yeah
just that's Pete say hi to Pete
here Pete
hello oh wait I have a scene for this
hold on
[Music]
oh who who is that who is
that uh L Donal Liam Donnelly says good
riddance oh I'm sorry I'm back back
sorry um all right so let's stay on this
topic of readability um obviously the
Hologram stuff we just got talking about
uh one of the forever discussion points
is uh color stuff you know color blind
uh um uh uh stuff just um uh the you
know everybody in chat type drop shadow
all at one time right now press f for
drop shadow you know one to drop shadow
just fix everybody fix everything talk
to me about readability um what are we
doing what what what's going on
here oh my God
yeah the well readability yeah
it's it's not as straightforward to
solve as we thought it would be um and
we have a constant battle with this um
partly to do
with uh exposure compensation I when
something's super bright your eye adapts
to that brightness and changes the
brightness levels of the scene um
obviously there's the the problems of
drawing a some colored text onto a black
background I.E a starry night and then
all of a sudden you're on a snowy
backdrop how do you compensate for that
um we've still got a few more irons in
the fire especially on vehicle hoods
about what we're going to do to solve
this and not um just drop shadow I think
what we've got on the lens now um on the
AR stuff is really going in the right
direction it's it's still needs tweaking
but we're we're we're we're pretty happy
with that but we've still got issues
with like the head-up display that are
on
vehicles um and the exposure
compensation on mfds um we still need to
look into
but yeah it's it's it's weirdly tricky
um the more diagetic you are the more
you sort Buy into the idea that these
things are in world and you're not
cheating and you're not just drawing
over the top of the screen with some um
flat UI like you do for like like I used
to work on um driving games years and
years ago and like you you draw the
world and you draw the car and then you
draw like a hood flat over the top and
that would like crystal clear and you
could see your lap time and stuff
whereas this is this is entirely
different and the the fact soon as you
put stuff in the world obviously it's
like it can be at angle and the sun can
shine on it or a big shadow goes across
it and you know even even your mobile
phone has a lot of exposure compensation
to compensate not your your eyes have
exposure compensation but phones have
exposure compensation so if you bring it
out in direct sunlight it's super bright
if you get it out like under the covers
in bed it's it's all dark and stuff um I
don't know why you'd be getting out your
phone under the covers in bed but maybe
that's just
me might serve away from this
conversation but in the future things
yeah we do want settings for color
blindness and we do want settings for
being able to set font sizes and so on
uh but that's still
yeah accessibilities are completely uh
offshoot of this where yeah I mean I
think is it one in 12 males uh have some
form of color blindness and some of the
colors uh We've chosen that don't really
work with
uh people that suffer in certain types
of color blindness problems no and again
we have all of the different
manufacturers and so on different styles
for every ship so it's like oh yeah this
ship works great and then in another one
you didn't at all understand that you
were dying or whatever well you know I
blame the
manufacturer um but in all seriousness
yes we're going to put the settings in
that will um uh combat that problem uh
but also accessibility options for
changing the font
sizes um this obviously has an impact on
the sort of graphic design look that we
initially have but essentially it will
become usable for people that have um
issues reading the font sizes or the uh
the particular colors that that maybe
that manufacturer uses so yes uh yes yes
and yes again for um options to help
with people with color blindness or for
font size access accessibility options
as well and in addition to that like as
we as we start uh really converting all
of the Legacy UI into building blocks
our new tech um all of the it's all
fully data driven now so we can just you
know that makes it much easier to just
like transform values uh where we need
to where we need to like in you know
inject a scaler if you you know if you
want to have bigger F fonts are lower
lower size fonts and and also colors
it's all data driven so it makes that
much
easier I feel like it's not static
anymore I feel like we've been talking
about billion blocks since 2018 maybe we
have to stop calling it our
[Laughter]
new just at the chat what what what's
good about it is we're we're not talking
about building blocks to we we are happy
where we're at with this right biling
BLX itself has has grown is basically
what you're say Bing BL continues to
evolve you continue to add new function
oh we need to like optimize it greatly
there's still a lot of optimization work
um that we need to do I that that's kind
of down to uh weirdly it's like a victim
of its own success this this happens a
lot with uh our game where we go oh
we've we've optimized like entities like
we we someone puts a thousand entities
in and it's running slow okay well we've
made it run twice as quick or whatever
oh that's great we've now put 3,000
entities in and then you know within
within a couple of years right it's now
300,000 entities in because it's a it's
a battle battle a bit negative but it's
it's it's a virtuous circle like we we
speed things up you can do more stuff we
speed things up you can do more stuff
and it's the same with the UI so we
speed building blocks so we started off
with a you
know tens of nodes and now we talk about
hundreds of nodes and we're looking to
do thousands of nodes in you know in in
like a millisecond so um yeah there's
lots of optimization but doing the
optimizations just means we can do more
and more cool stuff and like lots of
little widgets and stuff and all moving
and animating and stuff like that a
virtuous
circle I like that a virtuous circle
I've been a bit more positive made Pete
laugh um citizen Scott says forget
readability I just hate blue that's what
c um all right uh so yeah so it sounds
like you know just a I'm not going to
sit here and try to sum all of that up
but it sounds like the the the biggest
factor of many factors is the is the
fact that R UI isn't just drawn on top
of the game like it is in so many other
games it is a fully diagetic in Universe
component because that's what we've
chosen to do we' we've CH we've chosen
to to do that so that we can so all the
environmental effects and everything the
things that seem like a bug or actually
a feature in some ways we we still need
to you know account for that stuff and
still need to to that so like um is
there like if you I can't remember the
effect but like there's a desaturation
effect right where everything sort of
goes black and white and everything goes
a bit hazy like the UI goes black and
white with it like because it's in world
like so at that point it loses its color
so it's the same thing or this things
where you get this extreme post-process
effect I think it's like when you uh
when you're to Thirsty whatever the word
is for Toth thirsty dehydrated
dehydrated thank you yes uh like we get
this like really chromatic aberation and
it affects the UI because it's in the
world like you're trying to read your
phone and you really need a drink and as
you've seen in the for the shopping now
we moved the UI to be in world as well
and that just made it for such a big
challenge to implement it's just it is a
tough thing to do I think that's the
bottom line but we uh we are adamant
about this is our way this is how we do
the things and it should should feel
real it should feel tangible and yeah I
think that's the bottom line Revan Z
says show us some teasers that's the
other show the other show we just did a
whole thing about all this stuff we're
talking about it was on the other show
watch the other show
um Moby glass uh what other mobiglass
apps can we look forward to uh any hints
of integration uh with something like
Spectrum
so for the mob glass you uh if you've
seen the new one anyway there are some
apps that we obviously didn't update so
for the future we will have that the the
coms app will be replaced by something
helping you do your org stuff instead
maybe so that will be be playing into a
lot of social things and we'll be
updating uh knicknacks will also
get well it will essentially be
replaced by a new app coming sometime in
the future uh but it's going to be a a
better user experience to keep track of
all of your
things oh J is going to beat me up
now you said org
stuff what or stuff all the secrets what
or stuff
Gabriel nothing I didn't say
anything that that's that's all we want
man it's been so long it was like sayon
2013 when we introduced or stuff it's
still not in
game well you heard it here first what
did I hear tell tell tell us what we
heard orgs you're gonna you're GNA have
an dedicated app to do all your or
Communications and well there there's a
lot of things that we have grand plans
for but uh yeah I don't want to say more
than that at this point this isn't this
isn't the place we're going to we're
going to share them but yes folks you've
been patient I
know just a little while longer I'm not
even going to say a little while longer
just some point some indeterminate
amount of time
longer all right
uh is there a plan to avoid HUD clutter
uh such as you know when all the markers
end up overlapping each other and stuff
like
that yeah so uh we are currently
designing looking into a design for how
we want to solve this uh so there's a a
lot of different issues at once and I
think the short answer is just yes
there's a plan uh we still have things
to figure out so it's in the future but
we are for sure getting it and you can
already see that we have improved the
quantum stuff for 323 way less Quantum
markers you don't get this massive
circle of just a 100 markers everywhere
you look uh so that's that's a start so
we're we're doing things but it will get
better I'm just going to go ahead and
ask why did what caused that and why did
it take so long to resolve like we we've
we've had that we've had had the screen
surrounded by Quantum markers for what
seems like at least half of our playable
game time here what what took so long
and what what caused it and and and and
how did we fix it I think I might have
caused it sounds about right I I might
have dropped myself in it but yeah we
talked about I show other points of
interest we show other points of
interest it turns out there's a lot of
interesting points in the
universe um
yeah it was about filtering right so uh
filtering what you want was really
tricky
so um it just didn't happen for a long
time so uh
because you can't filter by distance
because you obviously want to go to
places far away um
so yeah it it it it was it was an
extremely tricky problem to solve again
uh
and um it's taken this long to actually
get to a usable solution like if we talk
about the markets like we we we've had
long discussions about well let's merge
markets together when they start
overlapping so well do you have enough
information you know if you merge um uh
one of your friends with a planet like
like do you get the information about
that kind of stuff like yes it's not you
don't have the information where you
just get a a blood of overlapping text
that's no good right so how do you you
know do you make them avoid each other
or do you make them like hey your
friends here and also there's a planet
here how do you describe that as a bit
of UI it's
all deep deeply tricky problems to solve
in a sort systemic way everything needs
to be systemic we can't just say oh
right here's just the rule set because
the rule set is is endlessly complicated
because we have an endlessly complicated
game yeah no you you hit it right there
that's that's actually you you you've
said the thing I've been I've been I
didn't know what I was waiting to hear
but you said it the systemic Solutions
are what take are what take so long like
it would be easy enough to go in there
and stick a proverbial patch on
something and just stop it you know stop
it temporarily but everybody knows the
most permanent solution in any the most
permanent thing in any video game is a
temporary solution and it would end up
just blocking and breaking a bunch of
things down the line it's you know we
always look for these these broader
systemic Solutions that can keep solving
these problems as we add new things and
when we don't we always get tripped up
like if we sort of cheat like say oh
well let's just you know and come up
with some Budgy rule right uh we always
get tripped up by it because something
else comes
on and again when I've worked on more
traditional video games let's say
driving games like we you would only
like
draw a way you if you going to draw the
world you only have to draw the enough
of the world away from the track whereas
in Star Citizen you can go anywhere and
all these things interact with each
other in a systemic way um you have to
find a solution that works correctly all
the time and um yeah we've really made a
a challenge for ourselves to do yeah but
we are wor love it though I think if you
ask the same question about other things
why it is it been there and taking so
long and it's been there for
years uh it's because of s an old system
we don't want to touch it with a 10-ft
pole you know it's a waste of time
flash because because we we we have this
new system that we're working on and all
the focus ideally should be directed
towards that we're in the middle of
development yeah and for this question
specifically like the marker system has
now been reworked we have a new marker
system so it's no longer in Flash we can
we can actually start looking into this
we we now know exactly how things are
done and we have have yeah good we have
our best man
it uh the bearded blink uh in chat in
chat says search bars and scrollable
chat anything search bars and scrollable
chat scrollable chat for sure that's the
thing that's in in 323 as as far as I'm
aware maybe I'm misunderstanding but
yeah and uh search bars in general we're
uh for most new designs we're looking at
adding search
functionality Emily I don't know you you
did some stuff for the star map yeah the
star map has search um obviously cool I
mean I know the chat was just it's we
basically just reskin the chat but I
think the I mean the long-term plan is
to overhaul that system has some changes
I think there's some there's some
changes to the chat I worked on like a
very early version of it to have like
different tabs I assume that yeah yeah
the new chat is very nice to use uh I
think people are going to be very happy
with that but it it will also be
improved down the line the content of
the chat notwithstanding yeah exactly
that's up that's up to you
people um Arc VR says FPS Compass needs
help uh let's talk to our about our next
question um the new latitude longitude
altitude readout in the map is amazing
although altitude is given as a distance
from the center of the planet question
mark and latitudes are inverted from the
North Pole at the bottom the compass is
pointing towards a point at the equator
not to any of the poles is this an
intentional choice to confuse us or is
the North Pole merely on a temporary
summer
vacation Sounds like our job is done
there right or I think I think I think
even the question explains
complexity yeah so uh yeah we do have a
new design for this stuff and um it's
it's been simmering in the background
but it's not been the top priority thing
when we're looking at bringing all these
new cool features like obviously we now
do have a the compass strip on the HUD
and everything but uh there's still
tuning to do and yes all of those things
are are the goal that's the end goal
like we we have decisions have been made
on how this should be implemented but
they have not been we're not just
supposed to have A Beautiful Mind to to
figure this thing out well so far but
not forever okay
um why does the circular quick interact
menu I think it's pipus why does a
circular why does the circular quick
interact menu look so different to all
the other UI
elements we didn't have time I think
that's the bottom line isn't this
because it's not effectively in world
right
well I also think it's that we didn't
have it's in your head yeah yeah not
your head it it's it is in your head but
um it didn't we do have a a new restyle
version of it
so I think my suspicion is that since we
do have the the style mockup hopefully
we'll get that style in game it it
should fit with the other UI that's but
you do make a you do make make a good
point it is we just got T talking about
all these diagetic in Universe elements
but the personal interaction system is
not that is actually a that is actually
a visualiz a Sci-Fi visualization of of
a choice Matrix in your head so like I I
suppose it should look different yeah
but makes sense it maybe it doesn't have
a brand at
least my mind is branded by
ages oh now now I'm thinking now I'm
thinking um all
right are there plans to make the uiux
of the cockpit view be as good as the
external Starship
view so this is someone being a bit
funny I think the external Starship view
has no UI at all it's it's very yeah
that's it uh but I don't think there's a
plan to do that we don't go that far but
we are uh we are working on the HUD
experience for ships for sure that's
that's a big one uh and it's going to be
cleaner and we're going to add more
options for people to turn off things
that they don't want to bother them when
they're flying around also just looking
at the new uh flight mode that we're
getting in 323 it's a very clean
experience it's very nice to just fly
around and flight mode and enjoy that so
that's not Quantum because then you get
the markers still less markers than
before but then you can go into flight
and just do the thing that it's clean
it's nice I'm glad you figured it out I
was sitting the around I'm like there is
no UI in the thing what is he talking
about and and Gabriel's like he went
he's trolling or she I don't want so I
was thinking the other way around which
is can you see the UI from outside the
ships which we we also no no no we are
that's not diagetic no no no as in you
can see through the cockpit and see if
someone's flying a ship and you're like
Eva behind them you can see their UI
right oh that thing like cuz that's like
being on the bridge of a ship right you
can walk around and see what people are
doing on their various consoles and
stuff so you could
Eva and like take aak PE check out what
you're doing doing there on your Mobi
glass yeah I see you writing those
messages on your
Moi uh okay we got we got time for a few
more questions will will planets in the
star map be an actual render from the
real ones as then zoom in on any
location and be able to to some degree
see the terrain as it is on the real
planet yes this is something that I
really want to do and it's basically
a uh yeah I mean we should have like a
like a planet view you know I think I
and it's basically like almost like
Google Earth you can scroll in and see
any portion of the terrain and um but
you might not see all of the like things
that you've discovered right like off
the bat you can see the base terrain but
like as you you know find things darl
licks and caves and Mining resources and
things like that then they'll start
showing up kind of along with that and
integrated into that map um um and
that's also probably also going to tie
into the The Landing stuff as well so
you know you want to be able to see
terrain as well so we got to make that
work um with the map
system
okay um the
current the current animation for
opening the Mobi glass is rather slow I
was trying to think of the whole thing
uh uh rather uh now that we have great
things like interior Maps is there a
potential to quickly check Mobi where
you are instead of having to wait for
your character to raise their arm push
the button have it pop up such has there
been any thought or consideration about
speeding that process up we've got the
new mob glass but I think and you guys
tell me if I'm wrong that animation has
been there for yeah it's a it's a really
old animation we've we've updated the UI
but we need to also update the animation
at some point um it's probably something
that we're going to to be in discussion
with the um technical animators about
like how exactly that should work
there's we probably want uh like a
minimum time spec um so like you know
make it look good as long as it's under
X seconds so it should be should be
pretty quick um but we just need to
update that cuz it's just basically
like like
this right so so it's got to be it's got
to feel more organic um our whole thing
is like he's got to make it feel
diagetic in the world and grounded in
the
world and that really that kind you
might as well just have just put it in
2D at that point so that animation needs
to be needs to be um updated but it
requires it's going to require some work
from from the coordination with the uh
some other teams to do that yeah it's
it's it's it's very yes uh Papu in chat
says it's very pit boy like know we but
we have you we have phones today that
have gesture controls and stuff like
like you know the question I think the
first question there it is is you know
when you pull it up do you would you
actually have to hit a button or or can
it tell like hey I'm doing this you know
I'm not a shield Ma and you know I'm
trying to trying to get my mob that so
could it just pop up you know with that
does it need does it need to have the
push those questions that are probably
you know to be discussed and stuff yeah
I don't think facial recognition that
that's not going to exist in 900 years
in the future that wouldn't work yeah no
there's probably room to speed that up
um but we're not s but not making
promises that we're going to speed up
he's saying we're going to look into it
and it probably it's due for some
review um all right I don't know why I
switched back to you uh here we switch
back to me uh why does pathf finding not
work between several rooms or even
several
planets um so this is actually one of
the things that I fixed recently you
couldn't route between zones um I had it
working on it
but it turned out that it didn't work on
a server environment because again
things aren't streamed in and and those
entities that I need those Transit
entities don't necessarily exist so um
we do have a temporary solution for that
so it should work as so long as the
zones that you need to route between are
streamed in uh but there's a longer term
plan to make that work totally
regardless and much more reliably um the
uh I mean I think they're doing a
Transit refactor yeah so there's some
dependencies as well on some systems as
well so uh it is the
routing within in the last couple months
has gotten a lot more robust so it's a
lot more
reliable uh but there's still quite a
ways to go and I'm at kind of at the
point
where I'm kind of starting to depend on
some other systems and I got to wait
until they're further along and and then
that's going to benefit the map um
because it uses Ai and then if it
doesn't if that doesn't find a path then
it's got to use Transit so those are two
different sort of systems that are being
developed um at least for the interior
map I don't know if you can comment on
the star map routing but yeah I mean the
star routing I know we want to like
refactor that as well um cuz there are
some issues at the moment obviously like
because you set a route and then you go
there and it's moved since then so it
blocks things um and that gets really
frustrating um so we obviously need to
look into ways to handle that in the
future so that whenever you go anywhere
your route always exists you can always
do it you don't have to like reset it
and all of this so yeah there's a lot of
work still to be done on that but when
it comes specifically to this it's also
a bit of design right it's a decision
was made that you can root from your
ship because it's it's the hardware in
the ship doing the routing um but from
seeing Fe feed back like it it
discussions have been started like it's
starting
to yeah we'll see what happens in the
future with this one uh might be
something that we uh want to implement
where people can do it from the surfaces
of planets and so on I think like the
main reason it's in the ship at the
moment is because the system is tied to
like checking whether you have enough
fuel right and if you're if you don't
have that ship available it doesn't know
whether you have that fuel so we need to
like account for that and consider that
if if we're going to allow you to do
that from just standing
anywhere and uh for the folks in the
chat that are picking up on Transit
refactor it's not anything super sexy or
amazing just consider that when server
meshing and you have to be able to
divide all these areas into into
different servers and that includes
sometimes Landing zones if you guys all
decide to go to to one stuff and the
trains need to work across servers it's
just some code
stuff uh they Gom on to everything that
Transit refactor
just some underlying Tech stuff just
just code stuff yep
uh will there be a means of locating our
ships further out than just 20 kilm away
from us uh either the current ship that
we have or former ships lost ships
wrecks ships we had to abandon um this
easier way to find our litter I suppose
what they're asking yeah so what happens
now is really that the ship will stream
out when when you don't see it when it's
behind something maybe it's just too far
away um different situations will stream
it out anyway and then it's it gets
harder to find I'm not I'm not sure how
the data is stored and so on but I think
that's uh like we could store that
position that the ship had when you left
it but obviously then someone could take
it and you wouldn't know because it's
streamed out on on your end so uh the
bottom line is in the the future this is
something that we would want because
with a lot of changes that we're getting
in yeah for future patches it's going to
make sense to keep track of more of
these things so yeah but currently it's
uh it's a short distance thing but you
can do it you you you do have it now on
the Mobi you locate your ship
and uh we got time for just two more
questions here um
first one's
about widescreen Ultra widescreen weird
aspect ratios that's that's obviously um
it's no secret that that the Star
Citizen Community tend to be early
adopters of a lot of a lot of different
Tech you know VR and stuff like that so
it it's there's a lot of folks who have
super insano wide monitors that wrap
around them and stuff um what can what
what what can you tell them about any
support any work being done to to help
alleviate some of the weirdness that
happens when they have these super weird
monitors I suppose the most
straightforward answer is the slider the
slider which goes from uh the standard
16 B9 uh aspect ratio that you'd get on
a one regular monitor uh and then you
can slide it to whatever aspect ratio
you're running at so if you've got three
monitors uh you're going to be 48 by9
effectively right so if you've got the
corner piece like the interior map or um
and the thing in the top right and the
health bar you could effectively put
them right to the corners of monitor one
and monitor 3 and like be like this all
the time but it's on a slider so you can
choose somewhere between 60 min9 and
have it like on your Center monitor if
you got a 60 min9 Monitor and then move
it all the way out to however many many
monitors you have uh or if you've got
like a 21 B9 it's probably just going to
be a small change but
it it's user
defined that thing yeah and that's in
already that's in already yeah so okay
um the last question I want to add is uh
this this is one of those forever
questions I'm looking at the list here
and there's at least three I'm looking
at that are all the same thing
here customiz uh
customizability it's we talked about you
know readability issues we talked about
accessibility issues um we talked about
the one guy who just didn't like
blue um what
about what about the ability to I don't
want my mini map up there I want my mini
map over there I want how our answer to
this has changed over the years I've
been here long enough and followed the
project even before that to know that
our answer is changed as as as as as
different regimes have come and as
different schools of thought have come
as we've learned more about how diagetic
we want to make things which limits
certain options so I'd like to get the
answer today today's version of this
answer and it's only today's version you
know keeping in mind that we are a game
that is continuously evolving
continuously in development stuff and
the answer may change later on but
what's our thoughts today about the
possibility of customization being able
to move these widgets wherever we want
and stuff so I
before Gabrielle replies I'll just sort
of give you my opinion which
is our first this is sort of our first
drop of and obviously we're going to do
the vehicles as well we've got the first
drop of the new visor visor and lens
layouts and what we want to do is make
that as good as
possible uh for everyone as much as
possible right so in an Ideal World
nobody you would want nobody to want to
customize it because it's perfect but we
don't live in an Ideal World so um you
know we're open to design decision from
there I suppose but that ideally we get
to a position
where uh the Design's good for uh
absolute majority of cases and it's not
like people going I I just hate this
thing I want to turn turn off the
interior map or I want to turn off my
health bar or whatever um if the health
bar is not as intrusive or health bar
I'm just paraphrasing but you you have a
you have a thing that just comes on and
just notifies you something and goes off
then maybe it's not not so intrusive
that you going ah I must turn this thing
off um if we get as much right then you
sort of reduce the need for that much
customization yeah but presumably the
the customization question is still
open-ended yeah I guess to a degree
right because I fully agree like we are
working on this UI actively this is
always improving and we are making it as
good as we can
but bottom line is it's always nice with
customizability and I think that would
be again for the farflung future really
we we need to uh to make sure that we
have all the UI at its best and then we
can start looking into okay now now it's
worth giving people the power because
we've done our best now and uh let's
let's allow them and also let's allow
ourselves to take the time to look into
something like this because it's yeah
also which which is equal on the sort of
accessibility options as well if you if
you get it right then
hopefully a lot of the accessibility
issues uh are not as strong but you
still we will have all these
accessibility off um options for
changing the text side and stuff but it
it takes you away from them you know the
best the best version but you you might
make it more usable for uh certain
individuals oh sorry there certain
aspects like you know um turning the
mini map on on or off like people you
know you you want to you want to allow
for that cuz maybe you don't want to see
a the map all the time you want to use
the signs you kind of want to play more
of um like you you want to let let
yourself discover the environment
without tools it's kind of like letting
go of technology in a way like going off
in a forest or something um but having
that there at least uh like
initially that allows us to kind of
gather a lot of the testing like is it
going to break on a specific machine or
a
setup um and so we can gather more data
initially and then you know we can
figure out um maybe like a like a
hardcore mode for for the HUD like where
you don't have certain things it's just
wipe everything away
yeah turning things off is certainly
something that's going to be easy I feel
like I would want to play under that
mode sometimes it's a lot easier to turn
the mini map on off than it was to write
it in the first
place all right well uh folks that's it
you survived uh you did another star
seon life thank you so much uh for
taking your time to uh you know be here
uh at the end of the week and and talk
to us and answer folks questions um hold
on to do one more hi look at that look
at that I'm just playing we just do a
little hi oh look I'm in two places um
I'm just going to leave it here because
I'm
just what am I doing oh I'm ending the
show I I looked over there the person
usually tells me what I'm doing they're
not there uh so yeah that's it that's
this week's show uh thanks for hanging
out with us uh thanks for watching if
you haven't check out yesterday's ISC uh
it was a great look at some of the the
new Arena Commander features that are
also coming their way in the upcoming
Alpha 323 um uh next week's shows are
um patch dependent the next week's shows
are uh will be one thing or it'll be
another thing depending on uh if 323
goes the live or not so uh keep your eye
on the robertsspaceindustries.com
website to uh learn more about that
about any announcements or or whatever
for that uh for this week's show uh
thank you to I got to do this this way
there we go thank you to uh bone to
Gabriel to Emily to Zane for taking the
time to be here on the show thank you to
Pete for changing my batteries out in
the middle of the show uh we knew we
were going to get Pete on the show at
some point today was this today was the
day uh and then of course uh thank you
guys uh for watching us and keep coming
back and and keep supporting us and
stuff and I don't know I'm I'm but I'm
butting crazy now here watch this hold
on was this can I can I do can I do bone
let me see if I can do bones
head on my there we
go no no okay no thanks everybody take
care bye bye bye bye they're never going
to let me do this again
