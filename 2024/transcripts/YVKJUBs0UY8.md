## Transcript

hi everybody uh welcome to we're back
welcome to we're
back Star Citizen live uh our our quas
weekly show where we take about an hour
at the end of our week and we hang out
with our developers uh we chat all
things to our citizen their personal
lives uh we show our cool GI Joe toys
sometimes uh and uh in this case of this
week uh we're talking we're answering
questions we're taking questions we're
putting questions to the
developer it's clear I've been not doing
this for three weeks hi
oh little buzz thing joining me on the
show this week uh is an esteemed friend
of the show a man who probably needs no
introduction but we're going to do it
anyway uh let's throw it to Cargo Chad
cargo Chad how you doing man doing good
how about yourself I'm in a mode where
I'm assigning nickname to everybody uh
your cargo Chad and there's the hydro
homies and I'm pretty sure uh next
week's show is is about Arena Commander
stuff in in Arena 3 I think I called
Duncan Duncan Arena man um I don't know
there's just I'm at a point where I
clearly should be stopped and nobody
is uh so yeah we're going to jump right
into it because we have a lot of
questions and stuff uh a few weeks ago
uh maybe four weeks ago uh we had an
inside Star Citizen uh with Chad and
members of the of of of the uspu team uh
talking about cargo hanger uh hangers
persistent hangers personal hangers
freight elevators uh all a bunch of
really exciting stuff for the non-combat
oriented uh citizen of which there are
many many of you out there I count
myself as one of them um this is work
that's all targeted for Alpha 323 uh and
recently as I'm sure most of you many of
you might have noticed uh with the this
week's road map round road map Roundup
it's a hard thing to say out loud with
this week's road map Roundup um it was
recently revealed that the cargo that
the uh instance hangers the freight
elevators uh the item kiosks everything
that's in that little that little cargo
package that cargo career update uh
that's coming still coming in the alpha
323 Branch uh would not be in the
initial uh release uh the initial
release being 3230 and then there might
a 3231 and 3232 and stuff that stuff
still being worked out and determined uh
it will still be in one of the
subsequent releases whether again
whether that is 0.1 point2 or whatnot
remains to be seen um joining us so Chad
um we're just going to jump right into
it uh tell everybody who you are because
in case somebody didn't see the show
tell everybody who you are what you do
for Star Citizen
and what
happened yeah so uh starting with the
easy questions
uh uh yeah my name is Chad mckenny I'm a
senior lead gameplay engineer um
currently in the Los Angeles studio uh
mainly focus on Star Citizen so I'm part
of the core gameplay group I have a kind
of sub team in that group called cgp 7
uh but we mainly focus on what I would
say are like the features that Mak
staris and like unique so like the big
MMO style gameplay features cargo like
certainly one of one of the big ones one
of the big careers right so our team is
really focused on those features um and
certainly over the last several years
that's been a really big Focus for us so
any of the big cargo stuff that you've
seen coming out over that time
physicalized cargo H SE all this stuff
has been my team's main
focus um but we've worked on a lot of
other stuff throughout the years um but
yeah like so what happened with cargo um
well the first thing I was hey is like I
don't know that there's anyone that's
like more personally invested in seeing
this like through than I am so it was
disappointing to come to the conclusion
that we did need to pull it from 323 or
push it into you know a point patch but
it was the right call and there's a lot
of factors that went into that um just
to kind of get into it like the first
thing is that it's a really really
big it's not even I don't even think you
can call it a single feature set it's
like a whole change to the way that the
game works from top to bottom in many
different aspects so whenever we started
concerted development on this last year
you know we come up with a certain
schedule and um at the end of the day if
you look at where we're hitting you know
while it is disappointing to see it slip
we're really close actually it's like
it's it's kind of like uh throwing a
dark like a Target like a mile away you
know we are a bit off we missed the
target but we're not so far off it's not
going to be like you know six months
from now or anything like this so it's a
bit disappointing that it missed the
release but we are really
close but so like the first thing is
just like it's big and it's hard to
estimate and and quite pin down all the
unknowns and everything and and make
sure that like your dates are exact by
the time uh the actual date comes up so
we're a little bit off on that part but
there's also just been a lot of things
that have happened during that time uh
some of the stuff towards the end that
really informed that decision making are
the fact that there's still some Feature
work that needs to be finished out um
there's some iteration that we're still
doing on certain aspects or that we did
on certain aspects of the design once we
got things up and going in particular uh
the freight elevator kiosk UI and the
item Bank UI once we played with them a
bit we realized we needed to update them
and change them to make them a better
experience and then on top of that in
particular the hker instancing asop and
Transit kind
of flow graph there about going from all
these different stages of gameplay uh
had some stability problems and it's the
kind of thing that I really felt
strongly that we can't go live with that
being not really stable because if we do
and it ends up being a problem the game
essentially becomes unplayable for the
players so it's it's not like you know
if we went out with Salvage and maybe
there's some issue with salvage or if
we're going out with mining or you know
the Rocks sometimes crash your client
like that that is really unfortunate
that affs a small subset of people yes
this is the kind of thing where the game
could literally just be unplayable you
can no longer summon your spaceships you
can no longer load your spaceships it's
a it's a pretty heavy thing so like in
comparison like ever since
318 we've been a lot more cognizant of
what kind of risk we want to take on
whenever we're going into the release so
whenever we were coming up on 323 we
were really aware of how big this was
and also really aware of like the
current state of 323 without all of that
feature work and because 323 was already
needing some more time to be focused on
to stabilize and improve performance we
didn't want to just rush this in and
then take something we already spent a
certain amount of time time hardening on
323 and then just destabilize it all
again and it probably just like reset
our whole release kind of pipeline there
but also then taking on all the the new
risk for the cargo work um but we are in
a child stream of the release stream so
that means that like we're ready to go
anytime we want to we can just pull the
trigger and and release it we're we're
right there so it's not like it's
stuffed away and and you know some
development stream it's like you know
still in in a bunker somewhere like
we're really close it's it's going
through the already you know certain
steps of the release phase it's just we
weren't ready we didn't want to
integrate it because of the risk and
already the the state of 323 itself um
but on top of that like to be completely
honest there this this feature has been
around like I said for for quite some
time and there's been a lot of things
that have happened just kind of outside
the feature that have also contributed
to it so like as people are probably
aware
there's been some team restructuring
Personnel changes um you know changes to
our like kind of vision and and
direction that have you know in
particular I think impacted like the
teams of working on this feature set so
it's made it a challenge at times to you
know stay focused on it and and and not
be affected by all that people changing
bringing people on board and getting
them up to speed about you know the
whole project and and everything so it's
it's been a whole journey but we're
really close um it's it is disappointing
to to put in this much effort that we've
put into it and then miss it but um I
felt like it was the right call so I I
appreciate I appreciate your cander on
that uh folks in the chat right here are
saying oh they don't want another 318
they admit
it yeah I mean I don't think I
I would not have thought that would have
been a surprise to to anybody or a
mystery to anybody
um I am often quoted as saying you know
we have the same conversations that our
backers have I'm just I'm going to talk
to you I'm going to talk to them we have
the same conversations you guys do we
just have them a few weeks earlier we
have the same concerns we have the same
excitements we have we take the same
blows to the Head uh it's and yeah three
uh 323 hit us as much as it hits you uh
uh in the in the heart and the head uh
in the fields uh we we don't want we
don't want that to happen again is this
me sitting here saying that it's never
going to happen again no I'm not going
to sit here and say something will never
happen but everybody here is working
very hard to make sure that it doesn't
happen again and decisions like this one
are one of the things that have to be
done in order to ensure that uh from
time to time so it is still 3:23 uh is
323 x uh whether that's 3231 or 3232
it's too early to say whether that's uh
before Invictus at Invictus slightly
after Invictus it's too early to say uh
but yeah like like like Chad said it's
all there it's all still in the branch
it's basically when everything else is
stabilized and secure and in a place
that we're happy and whatever then it's
like okay now let's introduce this this
this this new thing here and and see how
that affects things and fix those things
cuz yeah it's Chad made another great
point this is literally your ability to
summon and access your spaceship it's
it's a fundamental change to the way
everything moves in the persisent
universe so it is not a small feature
but uh 323 has a whole bunch of other
features we're currently 1 13 14
episodes in this season it's normally on
10 episodes we got a bunch more coming
it's it's a huge huge patch even without
this so we'll get all that stuff in
stabilize all that stuff and then turn
our attention back to this well Chad's
attention probably will never turn all
right so with that let's jump right into
the questions here uh this qu this this
uh uh show was originally scheduled for
two weeks ago uh so we put up a thread
and collected questions um we didn't
have the show two weeks ago because uh
uh Jared fell down and knocked himself
out true story actually I knocked myself
out got a
concussion mostly back in normal now got
a haircut uh so we're gonna I can't tell
the
difference you can't tell the difference
we concuss Jared non
concus neither could my mom all right so
uh we collected a bunch of questions
we're going to just jump right in uh the
first series of questions let's let's
let's talk about the personal hangers
for a while we'll get into overall cargo
gameplay and stuff uh but let's let's we
have a bunch of questions that are
focused primarily on the hangers so
let's jump into those one of the big
questions folks had after they watched I
was how do we prevent unwanted people
from getting into our personal hanger I
mean obviously there's some kind of
security around the elevator and stuff
uh we recorded for ISC but it didn't
make the cut at the time uh but also
what stops people from just charging the
outer doors and getting in what can you
tell us about access
restrictions yeah so the first thing
I'll say is like with everything this is
like the first release of this so what
we come out with Now isn't the
necessarily like our final Vision or
where we leave it and I can tell you
that we already are going to continue
working on this after this release so
there's going to be more to be done all
around but um for this release the way
that it's going to work is if somebody
who is not in your party somehow ends up
in your hanger then what's what we'll do
is we'll treat it kind of similar to the
impounding behavior that we have for the
landing areas where they'll get a bit of
a warning but then soon thereafter
they're going to get just get kicked out
and teleported out into the station if
they're in a ship the ship will get
impounded and that'll be that it's in an
Armistice zone so the players won't be
able to like draw weapons or shoot or
anything like this um
but excuse me but uh we do want to make
sure that like players aren't just you
know murdering each other in there um
but we can do better like I said we want
to have improved Security in the future
and make it a more less gaming kind of
experience to have heightened Security
in there but it is just going to be
using the impounding and teleporting
behavior for this release does that
include so obviously there there's some
time limit there there's some time
period couple seconds whatever uh if I
grab some if I get in there really fast
and I pick something up
before I'm impounded do I do I do I
teleport out with my stolen
booty uh you will but I mean it'll be
considered stolen at that point okay um
yeah like there's more to be done there
I think to make that like a more
well-founded experience but like for now
yeah you you'll get it but it will have
been stolen I think it'll probably prove
challenging to do a lot there like in in
in practice uh but I'm not going to be
surprised when we go live I'm sure
there's going to be some people who are
going to try to grief things and um we
might have to react in in particular but
uh it's it it's uh just one of those
things where we need to spend more time
with it to make a more well-founded like
full solution there so we're going with
the kind of easy or quick but uh clean
solution of just like yeah just teleport
people out and and just you know don't
don't try to be too clever about it
rukin rukin and chat says challenge
accepted
Chad like like there's going to be an
array of of of lightning fast thieves
trying to get in and grab stuff before
it it'll become a challenge it'll become
the 323 personal hanger thevery
challenge watch it'll
happen um in the chat they asked okay so
that's how uh Intruders what about uh uh
uh group members party members uh what's
their access to your hanger like yeah so
if they're in a party with you some if
someone's a party with you they have
access to your hanger even if you're not
there so uh let's say like I my home
location is area 18 and and Jared you're
in a party with me you can go to Area 18
and you'll have access to my hanger you
can go in when I'm not there you can go
in while I'm there you can use the Fred
elevator kiosk while you're in there you
can use the item Bank we want to make
multi crew gameplay as seamless as
possible so this is something in
particular that we were definitely
really thinking about throughout the
whole process uh effectively the way
that it'll work is when you go to the uh
access elevator in the station and you
call the elevator you're not going to
get a list of every hanger at the
station like I can't just go to somebody
else's hanger randomly rather what has
to happen is I need to be in a party
with them and then when I go in the
hanger I'll see my hangers in the
elevator list and any party memb hangers
in my list as well this is also another
way that we tamper down on some of the
the griefing it it doesn't get rid of it
immediately like I'm totally aware that
someone can just walk into the the
elevator but the point is that you can't
just without someone there use the
elevator and go to somebody else's
hanger like
independently however you can do that if
you're in a party with them that's also
a way to manage uh kind of the the
rights so if like you're in a party with
somebody and they end up misbehaving all
you need to do is actually just like
kick them from your party very quickly
they'll just be removed from the hanger
and and kicked out so it's a way for the
players to kind of control uh some of
the access that they're giving to other
players but when they have given it we
do want to make sure that it feels like
a very like kind of seamless
experience um yeah and again we actually
had a whole thing recorded on that and
stuff like this but we uh it just for
whatever reason it didn't make the the
show we knew we were having the followup
here so I'm glad we we got to cover it
um the person for
323 the personal hanger and I'm glad you
mentioned that even when this goes out
in 3 323 x-end all and be all of this
work like anything else for Star C
Center any the work continues to iterate
and evolve Beyond this for 323
your personal hanger is it's one it's
your home hanger it's it's at your it's
at your um your your your home base
whether it's uh Area 18 or microt or
lville or whatnot and the size that you
get is based on the largest ship that
you currently own at the time that you
log in and and pick it the next question
uh says what happens if you buy a larger
ship after that what happens to your
hanger if you bu end up buying a ship
that's too big for the hanger that
you've been
assigned yeah great question uh it's one
of those things that like I should have
gone into more detail on in the ISC it's
funny even when my wife watched it that
was the very first question that she
asked me after it was done um so like I
know everybody was like that's you know
immediately well ah what if I get
another ship or whatever um so yes we
we've thought about that um for this
release again this is just the first
release we're gonna we're going to
improve on this aspect of it for this
release the way that it will work is if
you buy a new ship whether that be
outside the game or in game with in game
currency and then you go to request that
ship you can't do it if the hanger isn't
large enough so instead what would
happen is you would be given a what we
call a public hanger and a public hanger
is similar to a personal hanger just the
differences is that if you were to leave
the location anything that you left in
that hanger will be um cleaned up and
and and thrown away so you can't treat
it like your personal hanger like the
personal hanger you can decorate and
leave all the stuff everywhere you log
out of the game log into the game it's
all still there Etc the public hangers
uh aren't like that although they're not
really that different and what I mean by
that is uh one of the things I didn't
have time to really go into in the ISC
is you know how how does all this work
when you're not at your home location
and you're not using a personal hanger
let's say my home location again is Area
18 and I go to Beijing point and I land
um those are still assistent hangers
they're just not your personal hangers
and the distinction here is just that if
I were to take my ship and land at beun
point and then I'm given a public hanger
while I'm at beun Point while I'm there
anything that I leave in there is going
to stay in the hanger so let's say I
just drop a bunch of boxes on the ground
and then go into the station to sell
some Commodities or whatever or do
anything else me and my friend then I go
back to the hanger the stuff in that
hanger is still there if I'm going to to
log out of the game and log back into
the game I actually still have my stuff
there it's only when I purposefully
leave the location that that stuff is is
taken away so that's a a public hanger
and when you say taken
away what do you mean you lose them
they're forfeit yeah so leave something
that we want to improve on in the future
what we would prefer to have is uh
rented storage and fact I'll get to that
in just a moment so that if you leave
it's more like you kind of have to like
buy it out of impounding you know or pay
like the fee for for the storage costs
for now it's just they're going to be
discarded you will get a warning when
that happens so that you know that
you're going to lose that stuff if you
were to leave it on the ground
accidentally in the public hanger but um
for now you're just going to lose them
but the the kind of what what my point
was with bringing all that up regarding
your own ship is that it's going to be
the same behavior as if you were to go
to different location in the game but
that is still a somewhat persistent
experience anyways while you're there
it's just not you it's what we won't do
and where I think some people have you
know kind of imagineered is that like we
would like grow your hanger magically
larger and like rearrange the things
like we're not going to do that and
instead what we want to do in a
subsequent release is to add a a whole
Pipeline and feature set for upgrading
your hangers including like moving
things around uh and on top of that
renting the hangers at other locations
in the game like it's not the intention
that the hangers are only at the initial
home locations it's just where we're
starting now because we don't have the
time to implement all of the feature
work and backend that's needed for
rentals and upgrades yeah I with
including like fees and all over time
and all this stuff so what what that
means is just that you're going to have
the one at the home location now but in
the future absolutely we want players to
use this as a way of like kind of having
a sense of progression in the game so
that when you're playing you can acrw
wealth you can then use that wealth to
expand your kind of area of influence
and where you can you know tag have
extra inventories have extra storage
locations and kind of spread throughout
and I think this will become especially
important once we bring more solar
systems online you're definitely going
to want to have I think more hangers
across the different solar systems in
the game so this is just step one it's
not the final you know stop in in this
progression we know where we're going
it's just trying to find the way to
carve up the feature to still hit an
initial release uh so this is one of
those things that we kind of you know
took a step back simplified it for now
um but we're going to do more okay no
good answer um you mentioned that uh
players will be able to go into your
hanger and access your inventory or
access the freight will they be able to
access their own stuff inside your
hanger yes so if someone is in a party
with you and they end up in your uh
hanger they can use the FR elevator
kiosk and when they use it they'll
access their own inventory and if they
were to use an item Bank in the um
hanger they they'll access their own
inventory when using the item Bank
something that we actually started
working on and in fact had working was
having them also access your inventory
so like if we were in a party um you
could come to my hanger and then have
the choice in the UI about whether you
want to take things using the pr
elevator kiosk from your inventory or my
inventory um but we had some uh concerns
about like security given
that party membership isn't maybe as
strong of a guarantee because you'll end
up in missions or or doing things with
people that are a little it's a little
bit maybe too uh much power to give to
somebody just because they're in a party
with with you to have them access your
own inventory so we still want to do
that part we just want to add more um
security and authorization functionality
to be able to say okay for this person
they can access my inventory they can't
uh so we we want more as far as like
permissions before introducing that part
but certain they will absolutely be able
to access their own inventory in your
hanger that sounds like you've played
with Sean
Tracy yes he he will just Jack all your
stuff and smile the whole time oh yeah
no he's very happy about it very happy
when he does
it
um how many home hangers uh can a player
have and can they change the location
after they choose them just the one for
now and no they can't change the home
location for this releas so like once
you get it that's the one that you have
again in the future we want to do more
for upgrading and Rental yeah we we'll
think about like moving I'm not sure how
I feel about that for the initial one so
there's still some a bit of design
thought about like every single Corner
case there about what we want to allow
for players but for for now for for 323
dox um you're not going to be able to to
move that that the persistent hanger
location so that's that's that that
answer was was was was was very candid
and truthful but I want to make sure
that that's understood because when
people make this decision I want to make
sure that everybody knows to consider it
uh when you start when this patch
launches you will get a decision to
choose your new starting location for
the duration of 323 until whatever comes
next when you choose Area 18 or microt
or or huren or what not uh you were you
were locking in your your persistent
hanger your persistent personal hanger
for the duration of that patch until
additional functionality comes on so
uh don't lose that information in the
and for the folks who were for the folks
who are making the the seven minute
cutdown version make sure that gets in
there indeed and and just to kind of
pramp another you know I I read
everything I I know like every question
you guys have thought about like I I
already know know it all so like ex
another thing that people have raised as
concerns is um you know Pirates like
what if I'm a pirate and I don't want to
like set my home location as forever to
be Area 18 I want to go to Grim hex you
know am I just screwed do I not get a
personal hanger uh the answer is again
like for 323 we just don't have the
functionality to allow for those other
locations to have them but it's not that
we don't want to allow that like we we
do want to it's just not going to be in
this particular
release
um are there plans to allow personal
hangers that are not at the major
Landing zones uh in the chat folks are
asking you about Grim heex uh but
possibly either uh stations or smaller
Ground locations or whatnot uh what can
you tell us yeah essentially anywhere
you can spawn a ship that has hang
anywhere that has hangers will have
personal hangers like that's the long
and short of it so the rest stops Grim
hacks uh we want it to be a prevalent
thing to give the player options of
course we'll come up with our own
decisionmaking as far as the economics
of it perhaps we will consider maybe
charging more or less or having
different Dynamics for um the the rental
aspect of it or or
whatever um but we want it to be a very
open thing we don't want it to be
constrained like again another thing
that I've seen people you know comment
on is that we're trying to push people
to play on the landing areas on the
planets um that were putting a lot of
focus to keep people on the planets it's
not actually our goal here it's just
what we needed to do to get this done
for this particular release we want
people to be able to go out in the
universe and claim some part of it and
feel like that's their home and if you
have a preference that's not you know on
a planet that's we want to empower that
we want you to feel like you can go
somewhere else and call that place your
home Grim hex iro whatever yeah um and
and have multiple even so that you can
bounce round so if you're spending a
period of time in one region of the game
especially like if once we get multiple
solar systems we want we don't want you
to feel like overly punished because you
just have this one location and and
you'll never go back to it because it's
so far away we want it to feel like
basically we're we're balancing here and
this I think also kind of gets to kind
of the core of Star Citizen as a game
which is we're we're threading this
needle of a simulation and and a you
know enjoyable game experience so we
want to make physicality and inventory
tie into that and make the game feel
tangible give you important decisions to
consider have um risks involved with
certain decisions so that you have to be
thoughtful and and there that feeds into
all aspects of the game so like for
example let's say I have a bunch of
inventory as far as like the guns and
loadouts that I have access to at my
home location if I'm going to go take a
bunch of missions it's like on the other
side of the solar system we want you to
actually think about that and then when
you're over there you you don't have as
many options as you had before you can't
just quickly change out your Loadout you
can't necessarily quickly stock up
unless you thought about it ahead of
time right so we want you to be thinking
about it at the same time we don't want
it to just be super punishing so that
you play for like 30 minutes die once
and then just feel like okay I'm just
done here I don't want to play this game
anymore we're trying to find that
balance to make it an interesting fun
experience have those simulation aspects
where it feels like a real space game
it's not magical you can't just summon a
thing out of thin air there there are uh
important reasons why you need to think
about what you take with you but it's um
not overly punishing which is like a
different track than other games like as
an example like like a game like Diablo
4 or like a you know many other classic
uh big games like that game you just
have like this in you have this
invisible inventory I mean you access it
from a chest but the point is you can
access it literally anywhere in the
world and it's all the same inventory
and that makes sense for that game right
they have different problems they have
different play patterns that they want
to encourage but for the game that we
want we want it to be a little bit more
thoughtful a little bit more tactile but
not as you know super punishing as maybe
like a escape from tarov or something
yeah
CH Choice matters you you obviously want
the choices to matter you want people to
benefit from good choices and you want
people to to struggle with poor choices
and as always you you bring it to that
point of realism and then you bring it
back to the point of fun and that's
that's that that that area is always the
hardest part you to find I I see I see
uh who's the person who's the person
that there's somebody that the the
Twitter algorithm's been putting in my
feed even though I try not to see him
all the time I can't remember his name
the Game of Thrones guy um but you know
you talking about the game not being a
Sim or whatnot and so certain aspects
yes are we want to push them to be more
simulation like and as close as we can
get within the confines of giant shared
server MMO technology and then bring it
back to the point of fun and stuff like
that so there's always that that balance
there uh greasy kesi
took me a while I remembered your
name get out of my feed yeah I keep
seeing them on
Twitter uh labotomy
uh labotomy in the chat asks how are you
going to make finding party me uh
finding a party member's hanger not a
scrolling contest in the elevator if
you're in a large party yeah so whenever
you go to the the elevator access
in the station when you call the
elevator that Carriage is your Carriage
so when it shows up it only has the
stops in it that you have access to so
by default if you start in your home
location like Area 18 and in this
example I keep using then I would go in
and if let's say I had a account that
the largest ship on it was uh a drake
cutless then I would go in and it would
have a medium hanger that I would see in
that list it would say you know whatever
cthulu dark cthulu Lords uh medium
hanger because that would be like my
name or something something edgy like
that uh so the point is is that like
I'll see my hanger in there but nobody
else's when I'm in a party with somebody
and then I call that hanger I'll see
their hangers at that location there as
well as mine but unless you have like a
lot of Hardy MERS there that list is not
going to be long in fact it's going to
be much smaller usually usually it's
going to be like one or maybe two maybe
three you know I am totally aware that
there are people that go into the server
and they just make you know this giant
single server party that that person if
you're in that party yes you'll go in
and you'll see like a a hundred in that
list uh I don't know I guess you in that
case you're gonna have a little bit of a
rough time but this is obviously a a
pretty big Corner case um so yeah that's
the main mechanism will get resolved as
the feature continues to develop and
people can choose more locations right
now in 323 they're limited to the four
primary locations but as people begin to
be able to choose different locations
for their primary personal hanger and
whatnot that that problem will get
diminished so yeah and actually I'll use
this as an opportunity to kind of reime
a point which is that it's only the ones
at that location that you have access to
so if I were to go to Beijing point and
I have a party member whose personal
home hanger is at Area 18 it's not going
to show up yeah it won't show up yeah so
like it's it's tied to the to the
location so for that reason it does get
parsed out and if you know as you as you
were to say in that 100 person server
unless all 100 people pick the same home
location it's still going to be spread
up amongst all the locations that they
all picked
independently um no beijan point is not
a new station he's saying beini what oh
sorry beini yeah i i i i this this comes
up a lot uh half the developers here
don't know the the term huren folks they
call it stand you know the term Hur but
but no no no no but I'm saying it's it's
there's internal names for stuff and
half the time that's what uh folks are
folks are knowing like the number of
times I had to be on the show like okay
which one Stanton 2 stop saying Stanton
2 yeah so we we know it as Arc Leo so
that's AR that's what we call it in game
so yeah so you you you you can give Chad
crap for all kinds of stuff not for not
remembering the specific name of
front-facing name of something that
doesn't exist on the internal stuff
um I was just trying to think of
something else I wanted to give a [ __ ]
about um how many people uh is so yeah
so these parties can be pretty big is
there a occupancy limit inside the
personal persistent
hangers no I mean it's not like uh it's
it's not like we go to a a club and it's
like oh no met occupancy you're gonna
have to wait to get in there's nothing
like that it it's you know if it fits it
sits if you can cram a 100 people in
there or at least attempt to like you
can do it but that that's no different
than right now in the game if you wanted
to go into a small Hangar and try to get
100 people in the server to to to walk
into the hanger you could try it right
there's there's nothing that's going to
stop you and that's the same thing here
yeah I'm I'm now I'm imagining what an
entire hanger crammed or entire server
crammed into one hanger and the videos
are come gonna come from that
um is that a knock at the
door is somebody knocking door they come
to take you away is there somebody at
the door just heard a knock at the
door it's not a gimmick right nobody's
having having me
on it was literally it was just a big
knock all
right uh so let's see something
something concuss
Jared yeah maybe maybe did I did I say I
swear is that somebody coming after me
um all right so we've uh so okay more
people Theory crafting here if a player
is inside their ship inside their
personal hanger and they log out from
the ship
bed where do they wake up when they come
back
in has the ship been stored
yeah so uh in this case it won't be back
in the hanger for this particular
release um again this is just one of
those things where uh there's a lot of
complexity in how the hanger instancing
works and considerations across shards
and uh server meshing and all of this so
for now no W it won't be that like if
you were to log out in your ship in your
hanger and then log back in you're going
to end up in your ship in your hanger
but we do want to revisit logging in and
out with the hangers in particular so
that's something that we're going to be
absolutely looking at more specifically
and if anyone's kept up with my hot take
commentary on on Spectrum they'll know
there's already some discussions like
more broadly about login flow and this
definitely ties into it about like just
generally how logging in is supposed to
work in the game and and Hangers are an
important aspect of that uh but we're
thinking much you know broader than that
we're thinking you know the whole game
so this we also need to be thinking
about things like Habs like bases uh all
all of it so this definitely an aspect
but in this particular release it's it's
not going to work out like that you'll
end up just um logging back in the
station yeah I I mean as it is right now
and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong
but I'm pretty sure if you try to bed
log in a ship in the hanger it doesn't
it doesn't let you because to try to
avoid it gives you a restriction
whatever but yeah as these things
become more of a home for for for
players as they begin to decorate it and
like this I can see I can see the desire
for that behavior to change which is
probably where that question comes from
absolutely um can we equip weapons and
our personal hangers despite the
Armistice
zes uh no um I'm laughing of it there
there was actually something of a bug
that we had recently with people being
able to draw weapons uh in in the green
zones but um no that's not going to be
possible you will be able to use the
tractor beams in your arms or sorry in
the hangers to be able to move things
around but you're not going to be able
to to pull out a gun it's it's not going
to be like a stand your ground law Zone
type situation uh for now you know
that's something that we maybe we
revisit I could see maybe a different
location in the game like like Grim
haacks maybe a more um p
uh Focus Place having a little bit more
standard ground type laws regarding like
what you can do but for the moment it's
just going to be uh you can use your
tractor beam and and that's it okay so
you still be able to like one thing we
don't want just to to maybe unpack that
a little bit is because people are going
to still be able to get in you know
through
these slightly Corner case ways like
someone can just fly in or someone can
just walk into Carriage if they can draw
their gun then while we can punish them
for that they could just walk up shoot
you in the head kill you while you're
just hanging out there moving cargo and
then yes they're going to get punished
but like for someone that's like
griefing they got what they wanted right
it doesn't matter if they ended up dying
or or even going to prison for a period
of time they kind of got what they
wanted out of that uh situation so we're
just not going to have that here for now
we'll revisit it again whenever we have
better improved security mechanisms and
more opportunity to consider all the the
designed aspects of it as well gotcha so
when you use the item Bank can you call
up a rocket launcher the rocket launcher
comes up in a crate no I mean you can
access them you just can't like raise
them and shoot somebody with it right so
you can it's just as if you're in the
station like you can have the gun on
your back you can get the gun out you
can use the tractor beam you can you can
hold it you can load the guns onto the
gun racks in the ship and stuff yeah
yeah so like all of that's fine you just
can't literally raise the gun and point
it at somebody and pull the trigger
that's the thing that you can't do all
right um last of our personal questions
before we personal hanger questions
before we get to the more cargo related
stuff um what does all this mean for our
OG Hangar flare items uh can we use them
to decorate our personal hangers how can
we decorate our personal
hangers so first off shout out to people
who who remember the old OG Hangar flare
um I remember way back in the day and we
had you know fish tanks and and the
jukeboxes and all of that and um in fact
my team was the team that worked on a
lot of that stuff way back in the day
and uh unfortunately saw it kind of RW
over time to the point that we ended up
removing it it just it was implemented
in a way that was very like Divergent
from where the rest of the game was
going as a more persistent
game uh so it definitely has a special
place in my heart like a lot of that
stuff unfortunately this relas we're not
going to have like Revisited that the
prop team would need to go back and and
uh rebuild some aspects of it because
they're quite old at this point there's
a lot of changes in the way some of the
features work uh especially things
regarding uh interactions and and
usability and all of that so yeah
there's some work there on the the props
and interactables team to be done and
they've been really focused on the
mainline Feature work for this release
so so it's not something that we've had
the time to get to but it's not
something that we've forgotten about
like definitely we we you know remember
those things funly um but it is kind of
easier actually sometimes to make new
things rather than like revisit a lot of
old things so uh one of the things that
we are adding in this in this release is
Furniture so you are going to be able to
buy furniture in game at certain
locations and then be able to decorate
your hanger with that couches and and
stuff like this so you'll still have
some things that are more social that
are more you know interesting make it
feel a little bit more homey to to um
decorate your hanger with and and
otherwise I look forward to all the fun
shenanigans that people get up to with
where they end up putting these things
but uh it's it's it's not like we
definitely want to encourage that kind
of thing we want players to feel like
this is their home we want players to
have some fun things to to be able to
decorate and place throughout the world
um but for now it's going to be the
newer Furniture um not the O OG hanger
it's a as a good rule of thumb for for
managing your expectations if you can if
you can pull it out and hold it in your
hands today then yes if if you if you
can't physically manipulate it in in the
game in 3222 or whatever patch we on
then no that's the stuff that's still
waiting to be brought in that's
basically the process they got to go
back the stuff was built like I said so
a lot of it was built by our old friends
at Behavior shout out to Dave Richard
and Christine Marsh way back and when uh
uh you know it was built specifically
for the hanger module it wasn't built to
be handled you know with with with with
you know hands and ik and stuff like
that almost almost used up my second
Square um so that stuff all got to be
converted it was also built in a
different way different metrics
different different processes back then
so like that so that process of of bring
that stuff over um I've seen the zoo
they've they've built what we call it a
zoo it's this giant level that's just
all of the hanger flare and they're slow
they they've been slowly when an artist
finishes on a task and he's and he or
she has like two days before they're
before the next task is ready for them
to begin they'll go over to that zoo and
and start working on on converting other
one so it is a thing that's in process
it's very very slow and it's one of
those things that I because that was
start Sy when I started on so like Chad
we have we have a big affinity for for a
lot of that old stuff I want I want my
stupid stupid juke box I want my
calendar I want my I want my calendar
that tells me what day of the week it is
in 2014 and stuff like that to to work
and I hope they don't fix that I hope it
still just tells you what day it is in
2014
um that's a good rule of thumb I think
for the for the players like if you if
you can manipulate it in game now it's
something that you'll be able to gain
access to and manipulate it then they're
going to be some things that you won't
be able to move without putting them
into an inventory container box um that
I mentioned I think on the ISC so there
there are going to be some things that
you can't just spawn the into the world
mainly because just the art honestly and
like the kind of gameplay setup of the
thing wouldn't allow it there's just
some things right now that really
weren't meant to be independently
spawned as opposed to like attach to
something uh but there's there's uh if
you can you know play with it in the
game now yes and and manipulate it then
then you'll have access I've been I've
I've been chasing Steve I I've been
torturing uh Steve Bender to to to take
that old uh towel old hitchhiker esque
towel from the old thing and make a
melee weapon out of it uh he ignores me
and walks the other direction
um it happens more and more the longer
I'm here quite honestly all right so
let's jump into some more cargo specific
gameplay um Chad are you are you okay if
we go a little bit over the pass yeah
like what's going to happen actually is
like once I'm done with here I'm going
to get ready and I'm going to hop on a
plane and then I'm going to a bar
citizen in Chicago so right I'm good
okay so we're we we'll take some we'll
we'll do some extra time uh uh we'll put
some extra bonus time on this one
because there are a lot of questions
this is a big topic for folks um how
does manual or autoloading work at
outposts scrapyards and other non-
hanger specific
locations uh great question the answer
is it won't
so if there's not a hanger you won't
have autoing as as an option um that is
a feature not a bug like the the the
point is is that like a small Outpost is
not the kind of place where you're going
to be doing large trades we're going to
be um this is something I I'm not sure I
got quite into as much detail on the ISC
but one of the big changes that we're
making about how you buy cargo is is
changing it from being a raw resource
allocation so you won't just be picking
like three seu and then have the system
like automatically figure out the
configuration of cargo that you would
need to put that into your ship rather
the um the places in the game are going
to have certain stock and that stock
will include the box size so The Outpost
the smaller locations in the game are
going to only trade in smaller volumes
and smaller box sizes so like one seu
two seu and the idea is that like those
um places is you're going to just
manually load it yourself and you
wouldn't show up with a C2 and fill it
with like 700 seu of onsu boxes and then
have it automatically pack it for you
that's not the point of that location in
the game it's not the the route that we
want that to satisfy it's not what we
want to do is differentiate the game we
want the locations in the game to serve
different roles we want there to be a
reason to go to different places in the
game and we want there to be a reason to
use different ships in the game if
you're a player that owns multiple ships
you will be now rewarded for you know
good decision making as far as like your
trade route considerations and your
location considerations and your ship
choices uh and on top of that if you
party with people you're going to
benefit from the let's say the the
choices that you have as a group and if
you're on a larger ship you're going to
benefit from them being able to help you
so these smaller locations we don't want
there to be like a giant hanger there
that like sucks your ship into it and
then just magically puts all of this
huge amount of cargo volume that's like
I guess just hidden underground or
something that's not really the point of
those locations on the flip side a
bigger trade route location like the
Leos which are a hub for feeding the
landing areas those are meant to be big
routes so like they are going to support
automatic floating we want there to be
big ships that go there and get these
big amount of loads and haul them around
but for those we would like like them to
deal in the kinds of box sizes that make
sense for high volumes uh so like the
the 24 the 32 Su boxes uh think of it
like this like you wouldn't show up to
I'm I'm from Oklahoma so I'm gon I'm
gonna drop a reference I don't know if
anybody knows what a loves is but it's
like a small truck stop
right so you want to show up to that
with like a huge truck I mean you would
with a truck but you wouldn't then like
take you know 10,000 boxes of Twinkies
and then load up your your truck and
then go to another you know love
somewhere and in in this in the world
that's not how Trad routes work right
instead you have smaller shipments that
will you know feed smaller routes uh but
then for bigger trade routes we have
like these
huge uh ships that F you know carry huge
loads of freight across the Panama Canal
all this stuff and they have really
particular routes that they go to with
these much larger shipping containers so
that's the idea here is that like there
going to be places that just deal in
higher volume there're going to be
places that deal in smaller volume and
there going to be some places in between
the locations will have the facilities
there that Mak sense for them um however
that means that like if you I totally
understand there might be someone in the
game that just never wants to pick up a
box right they just never want to do
that and like yes that means that
sometimes whenever you're hauling cargo
at these smaller locations in the game
like The Outpost that don't have
automatic loading you're going to have
to take the box out of your ship and put
it onto the uh freight elevator but that
is a pretty um short uh loop because the
way that it's going to work at The
Outpost is that the freight elevator is
literally attached to The Landing Pad so
it's it's a matter of a few feet away um
it's not like you have to go through
this huge experience you just land you
put the thing on on the freight elevator
you interact with it it'll take you not
very much time again for the loads that
you're dealing with we're not going to
have you move 500 seu at an outpost one
box at a time these are going to be
small loads whereas on the flip side if
you want to move 700 seu manually from a
C2 um at you know whatever Area 18 or
some other location in the game and you
have a crew of people you can do that
and you'll potentially be rewarded by
having a more favorable profit
margin um but obviously you're going to
have to have thought about that ahead of
time if you chose a bad configuration of
boxes that might take longer whereas
like if you bought your cargo at places
that dealt in larger box sizes you're
going to give yourself an easier time so
we're basically giving the players more
choices but also parsing it out to where
it makes sense about like why why you
would choose certain routes and what
you're trying to get out of it
um you said loves and there there was
there was this one we used to go
to association with Hostess chocolate
pudding filled pies loves and I was
thinking uh there's probably there's
probably a bues out there that's big
enough that would that would break the a
bies yeah there's probably one bues out
that's big enough to break the analogy
um for autoloading now obviously the
time the the time for an autoload is
something we can adjust and it's
something we absolutely certainly will
adjust we it's whatever it is in 323
will not be what it is in subsequent
patches in fact uh I will point
something out which is a lot of people
in the ISC of course dissected the video
to death and so one of the things that
they did is they would pause the video
when the UI the different uis are the
screen and like really you know delve
into like the pricing the times there I
will just say all of that was Dev data
like don't take that seriously because
that's just the data that us as as like
developers working on the game are
testing with that is not tuned data that
the economy team has finished yeah um so
I don't want people to have certain
expectations about timing or pricing and
then get to the game and realize it's
different and then be disappointed or or
or
surprised that just don't take those
numbers seriously I guess is what yeah
two things I always want to remind folks
of sorry for the detour uh obviously
there's the alpha live environment where
things will change then there's PTU
before that then there's evocati before
that and then there's where uh my my
guys you know will Dave Alex and Toby
are working uh in in the
absolute [ __ ] I'm going to say it it's
it's they're Saints they do they do they
do work that I could not do uh I don't
have the patience for it I think it's
that that information is All Temporary
it's all just don't believe anything you
ever see in a screen in a UI screen on
ISC it's way too early in the process
it's it's learn learn the lessons don't
give yourself the ulcer uh just remember
it's work in progress It's why we that's
why we stick it on there uh and then
also and kind of to to go a little bit
further with that the one of the things
that we want to be like kind of just
like a philosophy I'll put it like this
a philosophy that we have here is we we
want to encourage people to engage with
the manual loading so you should expect
that the pricing in the loading times
are going to be more favorable for
manual loading if you want to do
automatic loading that's totally cool we
want that to be a viable path it's not
going to be
unprofitable but it's not going to be as
profitable uh or even necessarily as um
time efficient as manual loading so we
want it to be an important tradeoff for
for players to to make that that
decision in addition to that we want the
the pricing and the load time to be a
little bit more intelligent like it will
take volume into account for sure so
like more cargo is going to take longer
uh and cost more but the other thing is
we want to encourage people to be making
smart decisions like you shouldn't show
up to a place and think you can buy 7001
seu boxes and the cost to and time to
load that is going to be the same as if
you got whatever you know the same
amount but in 32 suu boxes it's much
more efficient to move a larger box than
a lot of smaller ones
so for that reason the pricing and
timing is going to be considered of the
number of boxes not just the volume of
theu so there's a little bit of nuance
there but I I want you know to be
transparent about like the thought
process going in there and like why it
is the way that it is and what we're
trying to
encourage
um let's see uh is the mass of cargo
still planned to affect ship
performance yes it won't for this
release but it's um something that
absolutely we've we've been talking
about part of the problem is the it's
more like we would have done it in fact
even this release but there's some some
interesting I'll I'll put it like uh
considerations for the physics aspect of
it right now in the game uh if it
wouldn't be too difficult to make the
cargo boxes that are attached to the
actual cargo grids impact the mass of
the ship but the problem is is that if
you were to detach the cargo and just
lay it in the ship it won't because
anything that's inside the zone of the
vehicle doesn't contribute to the mass
of the vehicle at the
moment but that's true of anything like
you could drop a gun you could you know
dead bodies it doesn't matter anything
you just Chuck into the the the ship
loose is not necessarily contributing to
the mass either so it's like kind of a
bigger question about how we deal with
mass and science ships and also feeds
into other things about Force
and you know inheriting forces and
pushing things around which we also want
to use to encourage people to use cargo
grids as um an advantage over just
dropping stuff in your ship um so it's
we're not there yet we've act we've
absolutely been talking about it
actively it's something that we are
planning on um adding because we want
again that to add some interesting
decision making as far as not just the
the ship but also uh if you load up a
ship full of cargo we want it to fly
slower you're going to be a little bit
more D like endangered so if you're a
big hauler you're not going to be as
agile while you're moving your cargo and
that might encourage you to want to
party with other people who can uh
defend you uh and then also on top of
that it can help you make considerations
during the loading process you may want
to spread the the cargo around in your
ship which will take longer but it'll
make it maybe fly better
so it give you some interesting decision
making during the the loading
itself but yeah not not for this release
uh speaking of cargo grids uh when we
did our two point two point two-part uh
design brief uh cargo
career November last year I think uh uh
you mentioned that eventually we'll be
able to attach almost anything to a
cargo grid uh how's progress on that
going it's coming but it's not as far
along as I was hoping uh so I think this
release there going to be some probably
notable things that are missing I don't
want to say just yet exactly what but um
certainly vehicles are not going to be
able to be attached to Cargo grades this
release that one I will speak
confidently on um and that's just more
of considerations as far as the if the
entities themselves are really ready to
be uh attached to things dynamically
like that for physical reasons or if
they're ready to be just spawned in the
world independently like that so for
example ship items a lot of them are not
really designed to just be sat there in
the world they have like if you look at
them some of the geometry on them isn't
even like complete so it's it's that
kind of stuff where uh we're not quite
there yet and there might be some other
gameplay aspects with that with more
testing that we find that whenever
they're attached they cause problems
that need to be sorted out and we might
have to pull back on what ends up being
literally attachable to the cargo grid
that doesn't mean that they may not be
able to be called up on the freight
elevator because we can still place
things loose on the freight elevator but
not literally attached to the Grid in
those situations if we were to need to
but as far as like attaching them to the
cargo grid for example on the ship and
then flying around with them like on the
exterior of the whole SE like in the ISC
that we showed we still have that
ambition um it will be probably I think
a a prog you know kind of work over time
as far as like expanding everything that
will be attached uh it's still the
governing principle which is if it's in
game I I want it to attach to a cargo
grid
reasonably okay uh so not a thing that
probably but not corpses I I made that
joke
actually like that I would say is
unreasonable thing even though I I
mentioned it as an example you can't you
won't be able toest ATT a corpse to a
gargo grid
sorry I'm sorry
Jared will you be able to attach a space
suit to the cargo grid uh yes but that's
because the space uh suit will be a box
right so those things have already had
those considerations made for them so
that you can drop um It On The Ground
ends up being a box that should be able
to be attached to the the cargo grid
fine um What You Won't See is the the
loose like you know spacit that's kind
of like as if it were on a person on the
ground with like soft body physics or
something like that that we don't we
don't support again it doesn't work like
that in game now so you wouldn't attach
it to the cargo grid like that the way
that you do see those things is they're
in the boxes and the boxes you will be
able to attach serly saying anything
that I can hold or wear is not going to
attach the car yeah like if you can
physically manipulate it now then that's
something that you can reasonably expect
the the vehicles I think are reason
expect not to attach or to attach to
attach yeah CU what if I just hold on to
the thing and then I attach the thing to
the cargo grid you have to use the
tractor be right now
okay think you should reconsider the
corpses thing
I'll I'll keep it in mind but I have
questions uh when you think about it
everything is Cargo that's that's my
point that's my point it just seems like
you're gonna you're gonna go all the way
there and then just stop before we
become ravers I want to see I want to
see a giant Reaver H
holy just Giant floating ship of the
Dead you switch his face I can't staring
up my face for us you see Chad's face
just no okay Oh's he's stuck I broke
Chad okay um here here here's here's a
question uh is
there we're we're in overtime folks so
it's just don't think we're going to get
anything good is there any future at all
whatsoever for cargo decks Beyond just
buying tractor beams and empty
containers
great question I I think cargo decks are
an interesting thing in the game that
were I would say designed at a time that
we didn't really fully understand the
full scope of the game that we were
going to have and how exactly want we
wanted the cargo loop as a whole to like
come together I do think they still
serve an important role at the moment
but I there is work there to figure out
like what is the best thing for them
overall so so I don't want to give a
definitive answer on anything like that
um I will just say that like I we're
totally aware that they they're kind of
in an awkward place maybe you know at
the moment as far as like what role
they're serving and what we intend for
them in the future um but we yes we do
want them to be more integrated no no
cargo decks are about 15 pounds of
useless stuffed in a 5 pound sack
Chad I can't see his face if you don't
switch back to him
ah I'm just saying they they could use a
pass
[Music]
um uh what happens if we bring
Contraband or stolen goods back to our
personal we're back to personal hangers
so what happens if we can bring what
happens if we bring Contraband or stolen
goods back to our personal hangers uh
are we unable to store them do they flag
the the the popo what
happens uh so for the moment mostly it's
going to work like the way that it does
in game now um with the caveat that um
hauling missions in particular are going
to be different so if you just stole
somebody else's cargo box and store it
in your inventory it's not you're not
necessarily going to get arrested you
won't be able to sell it somewhere so
you're going to be like like in Area 18
for example you're not necessarily going
to get arrested for that or F or
anything for just having it on your
person however uh for the hauling
missions we want to make sure that
players are incentivized I'll say to
actually deliver the goods rather than
just short circuit it so if you were to
let's say take a emission from Crusader
and you get this big whole SE worth of
of cargo that you're intended to
deliver if you're going to take that to
a location that's not the delivery
destination the system will know and
will flag it and say like okay this is
like a high-risk thing you shouldn't
have it and um you'll you'll be notified
if you won't be able to sell those at a
normal uh location or sorry let me resay
that if you are trying to sell it it's
going to be flagged and actually you'll
get fined for
it even if you were to take it to like
grimhex let's say for example a place
that would normally take
like a no questions asked type um
terminal and you were to sell it there
you can but the the price is going to be
dramatically reduced because it's going
to be considered high risk so the idea
is that we don't want players
to basically take these missions and
just go to like the nearest like like
Grim Hax or something like that and just
offload it and not actually take it to
the place that uh isn't it's intended to
go on the flip side we don't want to
overly punish Pirates Who Don't
necessarily always know the ships that
they're trying to to steal from and and
while I know you know there's a lot of
discussions about like how much we favor
or don't favor piracy as like a loop in
the game we don't want to um completely
ice them out so that if they end up
accidentally coming across let's say
some boxes that were being delivered
somebody else somewhere else that they
just can't do anything with it and then
it becomes kind of just like random
about like what you can and can't steal
and sell reasonably but they will be at
a much lower cost so it's not going to
be the kind of thing where like oh I can
just like steal the boxes from somebody
else's uh hauling contract and then I'm
just Rich immediately because it's just
so much and I didn't have to do anything
for the time and then that would just
make it to where nobody could ever
deliver these things because people are
just constantly like camping the the
routes that they would be on so the tldr
is we don't want to necess overly
restrict where you can store things but
some of the high
high I'll say like high security or high
high value items are going to have
special casing for them okay uh current
storage crates are IND discernible from
one another in name and appearance will
it be possible to differentiate storage
containers via changes to either the
name the label the color or some other
means great question another thing that
um we've definitely talked about and
have plans for not going to be in this
release but we definitely want players
to lean into the inventory container
boxes and right now they're yeah they're
not
differentiable uh We've we have ideas
for things like tinting and and labeling
and naming I I don't want to say that
anything there is like totally concrete
that we are going to do it exactly one
particular way but we're definitely
going to do something there we we want
to give players a reason to use these uh
more and then once you use them more you
run into the problem of how do you
differentiate between them to say
they're like okay this is like my
weapons container or this is like my my
armor container or this is my ship items
we want players to have some way to
manage all of that to to you know keep
it in check like once you get a you know
a few of these going it's going to
become like a whacka about remembering
which one it was and opening them and
and realizing it was the wrong one or
calling the wrong one up from the
freight
elevator and so yes it's something that
we're planning but don't have a specific
uh solution that we've tied ourselves
down to yet okay uh just a few more
questions I think we can squeeze in here
uh how much total seu can the freight
elevator hold at any one time and are
all freight elevator capacities the same
at all
locations uh
I don't they're all different so there's
there's four different sizes there's
small medium large and extra large I
don't want to speak off the top of my
head to the exact volumes of those
because I'll probably misremember one uh
but they are different um and we want to
basically encourage people to upgrade
the ideas that if you have a smaller
ship you shouldn't necessarily be able
to do huge hauling runs on the flip side
want to encourage players being able to
call up ground vehicles uh or smaller
vehicles in the freight elevators which
we have not forgotten about I know that
something that players were looking
forward to that's still something we
want to support so that the sizes of the
freight elevators are designed to hold
the ships that we want players to be
able to call up from so the small ones
aren't going to be like super tiny but
uh the larger ones we certainly going to
be better for for holding like 30 like
32 Su boxes for example okay um let's
squeeze two more questions we haven't
talked about the ship lift so ship the
the lift that brings your ship up was
one of the really cool reveals in the
last uh the Cargo episode four weeks ago
uh I got two questions about the
shiplift here uh one will we be able to
call up multiple Vehicles simultaneously
on a single vehicle
lift not for this release so again
another thing that we've we definitely
have thought about and considered um at
the moment the experience is going to be
very similar to the current asop which
is you'll call up a ship if there's a
current ship on the on the landing
platform it'll lower and and despawn
that one spawn the new one then raise uh
so it'll just be one at a time for this
release but if you can move it off to
the side you can chain the the request
to to get multiple like that but what
you won't be able to do is like say like
okay I want my cutless and I want my
Gladius and I want my um Raw or
something like that and then you know on
on a big platform like want their Rock
I'm sorry said nobody nobody has ever in
the world in the history of Star Citizen
said I want my rock DS did you say rock
or Rock
DS yes I said Rock okay rock is fine
just nobody's ever said I want my rock
DS that's never happened no I didn't say
DS um okay I'm sorry yeah so like
there's some design considerations there
as well as technical um
how do they come up how do you pick
multiple at the same time how do you say
if there's three ships on the platform
and you only want to swap one of them
out like all of that stuff just adds
like a lot of complexity to the system
that we just didn't want to mess with
now we want to keep it simple and and
and get it working there's a lot that's
already changing in the ship spawning
flow right now adding this in the middle
of all that is was just a step too far
so we we are trying to keep this step an
you know an iterative step as far as
making the changes to spawning via this
ship platform but we will revisit this
it is something we we want uh again to
encourage people to upgrade to the
larger hangers so you know we want we
want that to not just be useful for Big
Ships but also multiple and also multi
careering and and all of
that I'm sorry chat it's not that I
don't like the Rock DS It's that I hate
it um it's okay it doesn't like you
either we're we're allowed to like some
things and not like other things people
think you just have
to I got feelings I got op it knows what
it did it doesn't do
nothing sorry
uh is there any other location oh s Last
Ship question is there any other other
location besides the personal hangers
where the ship lifts are being used to
deliver vehicles to
you not at the moment okay um all right
last
question I was just thinking about what
I said and I am going to get that
message now I'm in trouble uh fauna
323 H has the addition of of the copion
and the meric
bird hypothetically don't you dare say
not in this release
hypothetically if I go out to the plains
of of of of lville or Microtech and i i
coer a a kind and gentle Copan onto my
ship and I bring that ship back to my
personal hanger and then I coers the
kind and gentle copion out of my ship
into my personal
hanger and then I
leave does that copion now persist in my
personal hanger for all time
ah oh man uh so it's going to work the
way to think about what Will persist in
the hangers is just to think about what
Will persist in the ships because it's
identical uh and I think people have
probably seen the video of like people
spending like a month collecting NPCs in
the game and in their ship uh so for now
for sure uh if it persists in the
vehicle it's going to persist in in the
hanger in this case yes I believe that
the copon would persist I haven't
personally tested that
so but I'm pretty sure it would persist
um in in fact we already have bugs right
now about people um being attacked in
the station by like the copons and stuff
that were like kind of we'll say
encouraged into the station by some
other players so like if you're able to
get one all the way into your hanger
then like okay you're going to get
rewarded uh maybe that's your own
security mechanism we we solved it I
just I just you know I was so excited
for this for the for for for for the fa
and stuff and I see I see the backer so
many people are like can we kill it can
we hunt and murder it and I'm just
like that's we need pets I mean there
you go pets we we did it be be kind and
gentle bring them home and get and get
let them sit on the couch and stuff and
and keep them from falling be careful be
sure they don't fall down the vehicle
lift the doors open and stuff so I'm
just like I said I want to be real clear
I'm joking I'm having fun but he did not
say that's a definite thing that is
clearly an untested situation that I
presented to Chad uh he's speaking
hypothetically based on his knowledge of
how the system works right now uh this
is not a guarantee or or a an admitt
that it does work um but I want all of
you every single one of you to try it
when the time time comes because I'd
rather build little personal zoos than
be out there murdering a bunch of
virtual dog cat things who just want to
be
loved um that's it hey Chad do you want
to see my Cobra
hiss yeah show my Cobra his look at this
look at that mind you toy amazing isn't
it cool that is really cool actually
it's cool it's got a it's got a Viper in
driving and it's got Cobra Commander in
there it's really cool I like it
all right back to
me everybody that's the show thanks a
lot thanks for hanging out at the end of
this Friday I think we're going to do a
raid uh for somebody I didn't check my
messages to see who but if there's a
raid be sure you tell that uh spread the
spread the love and support our fellow
Star Citizen streamers in this fine day
uh if you haven't watched it check out
this week's episode of ISC it's all
about uh the Water Wizards who are who
are who are
uh doing all these big improvements to
the graphics and simulation and
rendering for water uh next week uh come
back to another episode of ISC uh it's
going to be on the whole host of Arena
Commander updates that are coming in 323
you thought the Pu just had a whole
bunch of pu stuff the 323 just had a
whole bunch of pu stuff it's even got a
whole bunch of stuff uh uh in 323
including new experimental modes and new
RAC tracks and a whole bunch of fixes
and the return of something folks have
been waiting for for a long time that
I'm not going to spoil right now cuz I
got to make another show for next
Thursday and then we'll come right back
here next Friday and we'll have a uh uh
all the members of the UI team bone uh
sit in the chair and uh they'll answer
your questions about UI stuff star map
and and interior map and MOB glass and
all that stuff so uh that was Chad say
hi Chad good bye Chad hi Chad goodbye
Chad I'm Jared thanks for watching uh
thanks for staying with us for extra
time today uh we know how much the the
stop toic means to folks uh take care
and yeah I'll see you next week
everybody bye
