Alpha 323 is just around the corner and
with that a host of new gameplay in
general life in the verse features but
it also includes a variety of
technological improvements like the
replication layer split our initial
implementation of Vulcan image of
scaling breakthroughs and the subject of
this week's show changes to the water
rendering and simulation system that
were first discussed at last year's
citizen G so here now are the water
Wizards themselves to tell us more
you've been doing this for a while now
why do you think people are so
interested in water in just any scenario
is such a focal point you go to a
national park you go see the rivers and
the waterfalls you're looking up stock
photos of anything it's people focus on
the water cuz it is just so different to
kind of anything else you find in nature
like everything's unique and
everything's different but water is just
something else
entirely wow you're making me sound like
I'm a water cult or something when you
came aboard did you imagine you'd be the
moist master I still don't refer to
myself as that name try as you might
Jared uh Hydro
homie uh I guess I didn't see it being
such a focus but I'm glad that it is
it's good fun I really like it it's not
all water water's just the nice things I
get to talk about more
someone asked me when I was at siton
recently what makes water 3D in games
what's different to anything else and
the truth is you have to work to make it
look like water because what we perceive
as a volumetric liquid in real life in
graphics we break down into different
Parts you have the water surface which
is what you see reflecting what you can
look through where you see your waves
and your foam and so on you have the fog
underneath and any particles floating
around that makes you feel like you're
inside water rather than just underneath
a surface above you and then you have
all the effects that go to selling that
whether it be the lighting the co stics
the boundary when it's intersecting your
visor or any of the splashes or
simulation that we're going to move on
to
so we showed a slice of what we've been
doing with water at siton last year and
what we put out into 323 is a few steps
ahead of that so we're going to show you
what we've been able to do
since getting the rendering right was
really key to making sure that the Sim
looks right because anything that
catches your eye and tells you this
isn't real is going to stick out far
more than any work that we put into the
Sim it has to be said that the way we've
entered water in the past in St czm was
not really up to scatch so we have spent
a lot of time trying to make it a lot
more realistic water is quite an
interesting thing to render it has very
complex form in its Dynamics and it the
way it animates but optically it's very
interesting too in some ways water is
like glass it's transparent it refracts
and distorts light which passes through
it and it also has a surface which
reflects the environment around it
in some ways water is also like fog it
obscures the background behind it maybe
completely obscuring it and certainly
impure water we'll have suspended
particles which themselves reflect light
and give the water a cloudy
Hue the water surface May feature foam
certainly where waves are occurring or
at shorelines one thing we wanted to do
was improve the way we render foam on
the ocean surface and this involved
having it show detail when view close up
and also having it disperse in a very
naturalistic way where the form breaks
apart into small patches and the bubble
dissipate one thing we did to get the
details on the closer views of foam is
photograph a pan of soapy water this
gave us the required detail to project
onto the form surface and give the look
we
wanted it's nice to think that all of
the form you see on any ocean in the
verse started its life in a soapy pan of
water in my
Kitchen in Star Citizen players can
enter the water this means they can view
the water from underneath the surface so
we spend lots of time making sure
underwater views look correct showing
fogging and so on similarly when the
player enters the water the water line
may cut across the player's visor and we
took a lot of time getting that to
render correctly and short as expected I
really think the improvements that have
gone into the rendering of the water
especially the surface the fog it's
Leaps and Bounds ahead of what was in
322 so from rendering let's move on to
surface
simulation what we wanted to do was
provide some Next Level visuals to go
with all the things that can interact
with water in our game with the nature
of the sandbox Universe there's just so
many ways you can interact with it and
with all our spaceships and The Colossal
thrusters and wakes they can throw off
we really wanted to be able to match
that with the water rendering
the way we decided to approach this
instead of having a square that follows
the camera like many games do of water
simulation we wanted to have something
more powerful than this we wanted you to
be able to stand at the top of a
mountain and watch a ship fly across a
lake underneath drawing the Wake behind
it and you wouldn't get that with a
fixed square around the
camera so the approach we took was
something called region-based surface
simulation this allows us to to allocate
areas where we need to be simulating and
propagating water waves at any given
moment regardless of where the camera is
we can allocate and deallocate these as
we need and we can have a pool of them
of any size depending on the spec of
your PC you can actually change the
maximum allowed regions in your graphics
options on medium setting you can have
32 regions simulated at the same time
you can even go to a very high setting
which would give you as many as 100 28
to choose the best regions we try to
have U the closest and most important
ones show up and call the other ones the
fact that we sort it by the number of
interaction how strong they are means
that only the most important ones will
be shown on screen which helps because
um having a little interaction right in
front of you could be useful but it
might not be visible when there's a very
big ship going right by and creating a
huge weight sounds like you a very
efficient system then we've tried to
build a very efficient
system in order to interact with things
that are in the water we first need to
know that they are there we've hooked up
to the physics system so it sens as
events when physical objects like boxes
or the player or bits of ship debris are
in or floating in the water from there
we can work out how much water has been
displaced and the velocity and pick an
appropriate simulation wave speed to
match those
from there we can apply forces to
different texels of each Sim region
which then propagate as we update that
region over time as well as responding
to physical objects in the water we can
also hook this up to other input
types for example we could have a ship
falling into water creating a huge
displacement but we can also have
footsteps near the
beach or we could also have a bullet and
missiles and
explosions for the player this means
that you can be way more immersed in
your game as you can see the Direct
effects of what you are doing how you
are playing on the
water we wanted to be able to create the
best visual impact we could without
having an impact on your bandwidth and
server performance Etc especially as we
move into bigger and bigger player
accounts so our water simulation is done
on the client and is visual only and I
think that way we get the best possible
result out of it all of the information
that we get from the different systems
is then packaged and sent to the water
buffer tying this all together is the
water buffer this allows us to take in
inputs from multiple systems to the
shape of the water surface and then use
that information in lots of other
systems such as additional effects and
of course rendering the water each patch
of ocean is able to render with both the
water buffer on and off if it is off it
simply shows the ocean waves according
to where it is on the planet if it is on
it first populates the water buffer
region with the wave data in that patch
we then add in any simulation data or
data from other inputs then when we come
to render the ocean patch we look up
again from this buffer where we have the
total added together result of both the
original ocean waves the simulation and
any other inputs to copy the simulation
in we build a mesh that covers parts of
the water buffer that we're going to
write into the UV coordinates of each
vertex in that mesh point to a specific
part of the region Atlas this allows us
to read specific parts of simulations
and input them to other parts of the
water buffer and it allows us to do it
in just one draw call having the water
buffer set up like this to receive
multiple inputs leaves the door open for
implementing multiple types of
simulation going forward for example
Beach Crest waves could be input into
this system this means as well that any
other system nearby can look up to see
where the waves are and see how high the
water is we use this to drive a number
of different
effects having the water buffer allows
us to have the graphic system query what
nearby waves are doing this allows us to
render things called Co sticks Co sticks
are where the ocean surface is focusing
sunlight onto areas nearby so for
example it may focus light from the sun
onto the seabed making certain bright
patches animate around
and similarly light can be reflected
upwards onto the side of a vehicle for
example cor sticks a very important
visual clue for water rendering and
leaving them out would would have meant
the water did not look
correct well that was a look into all
the work that went into the water in 323
the whole thing is pretty sweet I'm
really happy with how it looks the team
has done a fantastic job Planet Tech
have got some really exciting things
coming I'm really really excited to dive
back into the planets of Star Citizen I
hope you guys enjoy
it so what we learned this week well we
learned that the updated rendering
system makes water look more like water
that region-based simulation makes water
behave more like water and that the new
water buffer itself hooks into all the
other systems like physics which will
get its own series of improvements down
the line to make water interact better
with a variety of things that players
throw into it boy you you love throwing
things into the water don't you for
inside Star Citizen I'm Jared Huckaby
thanks for letting us share the process
of game development with you and we'll
see you all here next
